Urinary
Tract Infection
WHAT
IS A URINARY TRACT INFECTION?
General
Description of Urinary Tract Infections
A urinary tract
infection (UTI) is a condition where one or more structures in the
urinary tract become infected after bacteria overcome its strong
natural defenses. In spite of these defenses, UTIs are the most
common of all infections and can occur at any time in the life of
an individual. Almost 95% of cases of UTIs are caused by bacteria
that typically multiply at the opening of the urethra and travel
up to the bladder (known as the ascending route). Much less often,
bacteria spread to the kidney from the bloodstream. [ See Box
The
Urinary System and Its Defenses Against Bacteria.]
Different classifications that have been devised to help physicians
choose treatments and determine the causes of UTIs.
Primary or Recurrent UTIs. UTIs are classified as primary
or recurrent, depending on whether they are the first infection
or whether they are repeat events.
Uncomplicated and Complicated. They are also sometimes further
defined as either being uncomplicated or complicated
depending on the factors that trigger the infections.
Uncomplicated
infections are only associated with bacterial infection, most
often Escherichia coli ( E. coli ). They affect
women much more often than men.
Complicated
infections, which occur nearly as often in men as women, are
also caused by bacteria but they occur as a result of some anatomical
or structural abnormality, such as catheter use in the hospital
setting, bladder and kidney dysfunction, or kidney transplant.
Recurrences occur in up to 50% to 60% of patients with complicated
UTI if the underlying structural or anatomical abnormalities
are not corrected.
Classifications
Based on Symptoms and Levels of Infection. UTIs can also occur
without symptoms and with symptoms but very low bacterial levels.
When bacteria
is present and there are no symptoms it is called asymptomatic
UTI or also bacteriuria.
Some patients
can also have symptoms of infection with very low bacterial
counts. In such cases, the condition is called acute urethral
syndrome.
Uncomplicated
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
Cystitis.
Cystitis is the most common urinary tract infection and is sometimes
referred to as acute uncomplicated UTI . It occurs in the
lower urinary tract (the bladder and urethra) and nearly always
in women. In most cases, the infection is brief and acute and only
the surface of the bladder is infected. Deeper layers of the bladder
may be harmed if the infection becomes persistent, or chronic, or
if the urinary tract is structurally abnormal.
Pyelonephritis (Kidney Infection). When infection spreads
to the upper tract (the ureters and kidneys) it is called pyelonephritis,
or more commonly, kidney infection. As many as half of all women
with cystitis may have infections of the upper urinary tract at
the same time as cystitis.
Urethritis. When infection is limited only to the urethra,
the infection is known as urethritis. This is a common sexually
transmitted disease in men.
Complicated
UTIs
Complicated UTIs
may develop because of any one of a number of physical problems
and affect any gender and age group. The common feature in most
complicated UTIs is the inability of the urinary tract to clear
out bacteria because of a physical condition that causes obstruction
to the flow of urine or problems that hinder treatment success.
Recurrent
Urinary Tract Infections
Recurrence is
common after both complicated and uncomplicated UTIs.
After
a single uncomplicated acute urinary tract infection recurrence
occurs in approximately 27% to 48% of women. Infections usually
recur a few months apart.
The risk
after a complicated UTI is even higher; between 50% and 60%
of individuals will have recurrent infection by 4 to 6 weeks
following treatment if the underlying problem is not corrected.
Recurrence is
often defined as either reinfection or relapse.
Reinfection. About 80% of recurring UTIs are reinfections.
A reinfection occurs several weeks after antibiotic treatment has
cleared up the initial episode and is caused by a different organism
from the one that caused the original episode. The infecting agent
is usually introduced through the rectal region from fecal matter
and moves up through the urinary tract. It should be noted that
the original infecting organism frequently persists so it is often
difficult to distinguish a reinfection from a relapse.
Relapse. Relapse is the less common form of recurrent urinary
tract infection. It is diagnosed when a UTI recurs within two weeks
of treatment of the first episode and is caused by the same organism.
Relapse usually occurs in kidney infection (pyelonephritis) or is
associated with obstructions such as kidney stones, structural abnormalities,
or, in men, chronic prostatitis.
Asymptomatic
Urinary Tract Infection (Bacteriuria)
When a person
has no symptoms of infection but significant numbers of bacteria
have colonized the urinary tract, the condition is called asymptomatic
UTI (also called bacteriuria). (In general, there must be at least
10 5 UTI bacteria per milliliter of urine.) The condition
is harmless in most people and rarely persists, although it does
increase the risk for developing symptomatic UTIs.
Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is not necessary during most
routine medical examinations, with the following exceptions:
Pregnant
women (who are at higher risk for kidney infections
People
undergoing urologic surgery (such as prostate surgery in men),
in whom the condition can lead to serious infection.
It also may be
an indicator for serious health problems in the elderly.
Acute
Urethral Syndrome
People who have
symptoms of cystitis but have a bacterial count lower than that
ordinarily found in UTI are sometimes diagnosed with acute urethral
syndrome. This condition is usually caused by E. coli or
other bacteria that cause cystitis, but in lower numbers, or by
a sexually transmitted disease such as Chlamydia or gonorrhea.
THE URINARY SYSTEM AND ITS DEFENSES AGAINST BACTERIA
The Urinary System
The urinary
system is made up of several organs that help maintain proper
water and salt balance throughout the body and also expel
urine from the body. It is made up of the following organs
and structures:
The two kidneys, located on each side below the ribs and
toward the middle-back, play the major role in this process.
They filter waste products, water, and salts from the
blood to form urine.
Urine passes from each kidney to the bladder through
thin tubes called ureters.
Ureters empty into the bladder, which rests on
top of the pelvic floor . This is a muscular structure
similar to a sling running between the pubic bone in front
to the base of the spine.
The bladder stores the urine, which is then eliminated
from the body via another tube called the urethra,
which is the lowest part of the urinary tract. (In men
it is enclosed in the penis. In women it leads directly
out.)
Defense Systems Against Bacteria
Infection
does not always occur when bacteria are introduced into the
bladder. A number of defense systems protect the urinary tract
against infection-causing bacteria:
Many bacteria are washed out with normal urination.
Urine itself functions as an antiseptic, washing potentially
harmful bacteria out of the body. (Urine is normally sterile,
that is, free of bacteria, viruses, and fungi.)
The ureters are designed to prevent urine from backing
up into the kidney.
The prostate gland in men secretes infection-fighting
substances.
The immune systems itself in both sexes continuously fight
bacteria and other harmful micro-invaders. In addition,
the immune system defenses and antibacterial substances
in the mucus lining of the bladder eliminate many organisms.
In normal fertile women, the vagina is colonized by lactobacilli,
beneficial microorganisms that maintain a highly acidic
environment (low pH). Acid is hostile to other bacteria.
Lactobacilli also produce hydrogen peroxide, which helps
eliminate bacteria and reduces the ability of E. coli
to adhere to vaginal cells. ( E. coli is
the major bacterial culprit in urinary tract infections.)
Some interesting research suggests that when bacteria
infect the bladder, the cells that line the bladder literally
sacrifice themselves and self-destruct (a process called
apoptosis). In so doing, they shed away from the lining,
carrying the bacteria with them. This eliminates about
90% of the E. coli .
Some researchers have identified a possible natural antibiotic
called human beta-defensin-1 (HBD-1), which fights E-coli
within the female urinary and reproductive tract.
WHAT
ARE THE INFECTIOUS AGENTS IN URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS?
Bacterial
Strains in Uncomplicated UTIs
Bacteria are
the primary organisms that cause UTIs, mostly one called Escherichia
coli.
Bacterial Strains in Cystitis (Acute Uncomplicated UTI).
The bacterial strains likely to cause acute uncomplicated UTI are
the following:
E.
Coli. The gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli
is responsible for between 80% and 85% of cystitis cases. In
most cases of UTI, E. coli, which originates as a harmless
microorganism in the intestines, spreads to the vaginal passage
where it invades and colonizes the urinary tract. One study
suggests that even when infected cells lining the bladder die
and slough off, carrying the E. coli bacteria with them,
some bacteria can invade into deeper tissue in the bladder,
where they survive to reinfect the patient later on.
Staphylococcus
Saprophyticus. S. Saprophyticus is the second major bacterial
culprit, causing 5% to 15% of cases in women. Interestingly,
infections caused by this bacteria have a seasonal variation,
with incidence being higher in the summer and fall than in the
winter and spring.
Other
Primary Bacterial Agents. Klebsiella and Proteus
mirabilis bacteria account for most of the remaining causes
of UTI. Enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are
rare bacterial agents and are most often detected in hospital-acquired
UTIs. Some evidence suggests that ureaplasma urealyticum
and Mycoplasma hominis , which are generally harmless
organisms, may be responsible for occasional urinary tract disorders.
Bacterial
Strains in Acute Uncomplicated Pyelonephritis (Kidney Infection).
The bacteria that cause pyelonephritis are generally the same
bacteria that cause cystitis. There is some evidence, however, the
E. coli strains tend to be a more virulent (more able to
spread).
Organisms
in Complicated Infections
Complicated UTIs,
which are related to physical or structural conditions, are apt
to be caused by a wider range of organism.
E. coli is still the most common organism, but others have
also been detected, including the following:
Other
intestinal bacteria, including Klebsiella, P. mirabilis
, and Citrobacter.
Fungal
organisms, particularly Candida species. (Candida
albicans. for example, causes the so-called ""yeast infections""
that also occur in the mouth, intestinal area, and vagina.)
Others
include Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter,
and Serratia species, gram-positive organisms, including
Enterococcus species, and S. saprophyticus .
Bacterial
Strains in Recurrent UTIs
Recurring infections
are often caused by bacteria that are different from those that
caused a previous or first infection.
Even if the reinfecting bacterium is still E. coli , it may
be a variant of the original infecting E. coli strain. Such
strains produce substances, such as one called P fimbriae ,
which tend to make the bacteria more infectious. Uncommon causes
of reinfection include ureaplasma, and Mycoplasma hominis,
which are sometimes associated with the acute urethral syndrome.
Factors
in Overcoming the Bacterial Defense Systems
The bacteria
that cause most UTIs are very common and nearly everyone harbors
them. It is not clear, then, how they proliferate and break down
the natural defenses of the body. Among the possible ways this occurs
is the following.
Changes in the Acid-Alkaline Balance of the Urinary Tract.
Changes in the amount or type of acid within the genital and urinary
tracts are major contributors to lowering the resistance to infection.
For example, beneficial organisms called lactobacilli increase
the acidic environment in the urinary tract. Reductions in their
number (which, for example occurs with estrogen loss after menopause),
increases pH and therefore the risk of infection.
Biofilm. One theory, called the biofilm mode of growth, suggests
that sometimes bacteria form capsules that adhere to the urinary
tract, which protects them from many of the normal defenses.
WHAT
ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS?
Symptoms
of Lower Urinary Tract Infections (Cystitis and Urethritis)
Symptoms of lower
urinary tract infections usually begin suddenly and may include
one or more of the following symptoms:
The urge
to urinate frequently, which may recur immediately after the
bladder is emptied.
A painful
burning sensation. (If the only symptom is a burning sensation,
then the infection is most likely urethritis.)
Discomfort
or pressure in the lower abdomen. The abdomen can feel bloated.
Cramping
in the pelvic area or back.
The urine
often has a strong smell, looks cloudy, or contains blood. This
is a sign of pyuria, which means the presence of a high
white blood cell count, and is a very reliable sign for urinary
tract infections.
Occasionally,
fever develops.
Symptoms
of Kidney Infection (Pyelonephritis)
Symptoms of kidney
infections tend to be generalized and more severe than those of
cystitis. They may include the following:
Severe
cystitis symptoms, which include frequent, irritating, and strong-smelling
urination that can be cloudy and contain blood. (In some patients
with kidney infection, the only symptoms may be those of cystitis.
In such cases, pyelonephritis should be strongly suspected if
symptoms last seven to ten days. People at highest risk for
such ""silent"" upper urinary tract infections include patients
with diabetes, impaired immune systems, or who have a history
of relapsing or recurring UTIs.)
An increased
need to urinate at night.
Chills
and persistent fever (typically lasting more than two days).
Pain that
runs along the back at about waist level.
Vomiting
and nausea.
In elderly
people, mental changes or confusion may occur.
Symptoms
in Infants and Toddlers
UTIs in infants
and preschool children are more likely to occur in the kidneys and
upper urinary tract. (Older children are more likely to have
lower urinary tract infections and standard symptoms.) Infants and
young children should always be checked for UTIs if the following
symptoms are present:
A persistent
high fever of otherwise unknown cause, particularly if it is
accompanied by signs of feeding problems and debility, such
as listlessness and fatigue. (Between 3% and 5% of infants and
toddlers who are brought to the emergency room with fevers have
UTIs.)
Painful,
frequent, and foul smelling urine.
Cloudy
urine. (If the urine is clear, the child most likely has some
other ailment, although it is not absolute proof that the child
is UTI-free.)
Abdominal
and low back pain (may be present).
Vomiting
and abdominal pain (usually in infants).
WHAT
ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS?
Risk
Factors for Primary UTIs in Women
After the flu
and common cold, urinary tract infections are the most common medical
complaint among women in their reproductive years. Women are 30
times more likely to have cystitis than men . An estimated 7 million
episodes of urinary tract infection occur each year in the US, although
this rate may be much higher. And, every year about 250,000 American
women develop kidney infections (pyelonephritis), and 100,000 are
hospitalized for treatment.
On average, 10% to 20% of all women will develop a urinary tract
infection at some time in their lives and 20% of those will have
recurrent UTIs. The risk for UTIs, both symptomatic and asymptomatic,
is highest after menopause. (About 2% to 5% of young women have
asymptomatic bacteriuria; in women over 65 the prevalence is between
10% to 15%.)
Structure of the Female Urinary Tract. In general, the higher
risk in women is mostly due to the shortness of the female urethra,
which is one and one half inches compared to eight inches in men.
Bacteria from fecal matter can also be easily transferred to the
vagina or the urethra.
Sexual Behavior. Frequent sexual activity increases the
risk of urinary tract infection, and studies indicate that nearly
80% of all urinary tract infections occur within 24 hours of intercourse.
A number of different factors are responsible for the increased
incidence of UTIs among sexually active women:
Highly
active sexual behavior may increase the risk for sexually transmitted
infections such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, or herpes simplex virus.
Such agents may cause urethritis (infections in the urethra).
Women
having sex for the first time or who have intense and frequent
sex after a period of abstinence are at risk for a condition
called honeymoon cystitis.
A sudden
increase in the frequency of sexual intercourse poses a significant
risk for UTI, particularly if a diaphragm is used.
Sexual
position can contribute to the risk.
Contraceptives
may also contribute to risk in a number of ways:
The spring-rim
of the diaphragm may bruise the area near the bladder neck,
making it susceptible to bacteria.
Unlubricated
condoms may injure vaginal tissue and make it vulnerable to
infections. (Using a sterile lubricant, such as KY jelly, may
help reduce this risk. Petroleum-based lubricants should be
avoided because they weaken latex condoms.)
Spermicides
are not protective, and, in fact, greatly increase the risk
for urinary tract infections.
Some women
experience UTI as an allergic reaction to latex in condoms or
to oral contraceptives.
Pregnancy.
Although pregnancy does not increase the rates of asymptomatic
bacteriuria, it does increase the risk that it will progress to
a full-blown infection. About 2% to 11% of pregnant women have asymptomatic
bacteriuria and, of those, 13% to 27% will develop kidney infection
late in their term. (It should be noted, however, that in early
pregnancy, frequent urination, a common symptom of UTI, is most
likely due to pressure on the bladder.)
Although all pregnant women should be tested for UTIs, those at
particularly high risk are those with the following conditions or
situations:
Diabetes.
Sickle
cell trait.
Members
of low-income groups.
Women
who have had many children.
A history
of childhood UTIs.
Women
who have undergone a cesarean section with catheterization of
the bladder.
Women
who have received epidural anesthesia.
Women who have
had a UTI before or during pregnancy also have a higher risk of
developing recurrent urinary tract infections after delivery. Approximately
25% to 33% of women who experience bacteriuria during pregnancy
will have another urinary tract infection, sometimes as long as
ten to 14 years later.
Other Risk Factors in Women. Women who have skin allergies
to ingredients in soaps, vaginal creams, bubble baths, or other
chemicals that are used in the genital area are at high risk for
UTIs that may enter through small injuries. Smoking and taking tub
baths have also been implicated in increasing the risk for recurrent
urinary tract infections.
Risk
Factors of Recurring Infection in Women
Almost 20% of
all women who recover from a bout of cystitis experience recurrent
episodes. The major groups of women who are at highest risk for
recurrent infections are young highly sexually active women and
postmenopausal women. It might be argued that nearly all women who
have a urinary tract infection are at risk for another, particularly
if they are not treated for the first one.
Lifestyle Factors. Why urinary tract infections become chronic
and recurring in many women is not entirely clear, but researchers
are identifying certain lifestyle factors that may increase the
risk in specific women:
Having
more than four sexual intercourse episodes a month.
Recent
changes in sexual partners.
Having
a mother with a history of UTIs.
Having
a first UTI before age 15.
Use of
spermicides.
Biologic and
Physical Factors. Some women may also have certain biologic
or anatomical factors that increase the risk for recurring UTIs:
Having
a shorter than average distance between the urethra and the
anus.
Certain
women may carry a compound called sialosyl galactosyl globoside
(SGG) on the surface of kidney cells, which is a highly powerful
receptor for E. coli bacteria.
Certain
women have a genetic susceptibility to greater numbers of infecting
organisms in the vaginal areas that adhere to the lining.
Certain
women may be deficient in human beta-defensin-1 (HBD-1), believed
to be a naturally occurring antibiotic.
Changes in
the Aging Woman. Changes after menopause put older women at
particular risk for primary and recurring UTIs. In fact, studies
indicate that between 20% and 25% of women over 65 years old have
UTIs. A number of biologic factors in older women may also contribute
to this risk:
With estrogen
loss, there is a reduction of certain immune factors in the
vagina, which results in E. coli to adhere to vaginal
cells.
Lactobacilli
levels (the protective organisms) decline after menopause (perhaps
due to drops in estrogen).
Some women
carry the blood group P1, which, as they get older, makes them
susceptible to large numbers of cells in the vagina and urethra
that attract and bind a specific strain of E. coli .
This strain is resistant to normal infection-fighting mechanisms.
The walls
of the urinary tract thin out, weakening the mucous membrane
and reducing its ability to resist bacteria.
The bladder
may lose elasticity and fail to empty completely.
Aside from menopause,
other very strong risk factors for recurrences that are associated
with aging include urinary incontinence and previous operations
on the genital or urinary tracts.
Risk
Factors in Children
Primary UTIs
in Children. About 2% of children develop urinary tract infections.
Because males are more likely to be born with structural abnormalities
of the urinary tract, UTIs during the first six months of life are
more common in boys. The rates are about equal in toddlers. Afterward,
however, UTIs are far more common in girls. By the age of five,
UTIs are 50 times more common in girls than in boys. Within the
first ten years, boys will have a 1% and girls a 3% chance for developing
a UTI.
Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the source of urinary tract infections
in 30% to 50% of childhood cases. This is a structural defect of
the valve-like mechanism between the ureter and bladder which allows
urine to flow backward, carrying infection from the bladder up into
kidneys.
Recurring UTIs in Children. Recurrence will occur in about
30% of boys and 40% of girls. According to one study, the risk for
recurrence is highest in children with severe UTI caused by vesicoureteral
reflux, and such recurrences nearly always occurs within the first
six months after the first UTI.
Risk
Factors in Men
Men become more
susceptible to UTI after 50 years of age, when they begin to develop
prostate problems. From 5% to 15% of men over 65 will have asymptomatic
bacteriuria.
Unhealthy
Elderly Adults
All older adults
are at risk who are immobilized, catheterized, or dehydrated. Nursing
home patients, particularly those who are incontinent and demented,
are at very high risk for UTIs. Up to 40% of elderly patients who
live in nursing homes will contract a urinary tract infection. In
most cases, the infections are asymptomatic and no more harmful
than similar infections in the general population. Nursing home
patients, however, are at higher risk for developing symptoms.
Specific
Risk Factors for Complicated UTIs
Catheters
and Hospitalizations. About 40% of all infections that develop
in hospitalized patients are in the urinary tract, and 80% of those
are due to catheters. Nearly all patients who need urinary catheters
develop high levels of bacteria in their urine, and the longer the
catheter is in place, the higher the risk for infection. Catheterized
patients who develop diarrhea are nine times more likely to develop
UTIs than are patients without diarrhea. In most cases of catheter-induced
UTIs (90% in one study) the infection produces no symptoms. Because
of the risk for wider infection, however, anyone requiring a catheter
should be screened for infection. Catheters should be used only
when necessary and should be removed as soon as possible.
Kidney Stones. Kidney stones, in some cases, can cause obstruction
and cause infection, particularly pyelonephritis. Symptoms of severe
urinary tract infection in people with a history of kidney stones
may indicate obstruction of the urinary tract, which is a serious
condition.
Diabetes. Diabetes puts women (but not men) at significantly
higher risk for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The longer a woman has
diabetes, the higher the risk. (Control of blood sugar has no effect
on this condition.) The risk for symptomatic complicated UTIs may
also be higher in people with diabetes. In fact, certain UTI-related
abscesses are reported only in patients with diabetes. These patients
are also at higher risk for fungal-related UTIs.
Prostate Conditions in Men. Benign prostatic hyperplasia
can produce obstruction in the urinary tract and increase the risk
for infection. In men, recurrent urinary tract infections are associated
with prostatitis, an infection of the prostate gland that can also
be caused by E. coli .
Sickle-Cell Anemia. Patients with sickle-cell anemia are
particularly susceptible to kidney damage from their disease, and
UTIs put them at even greater risk.
Anatomical Abnormalities. Some people have structural abnormalities
of the urinary tract that cause urine to stagnate or flow backward
into the upper urinary tract. Such conditions include the following:
A prolapsed
bladder (cystocele) can result in incomplete urination so that
urine collects, creating a breeding ground for bacteria.
Crevasses
called diverticula sometimes develop inside the urethral wall
and can become tiny pockets for urine and debris, further increasing
the risk for infection.
Kidney Problems.
Nearly any kidney disorders increased the risk for complicated
UTIs.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics often
eliminate lactobacilli, the protective bacteria, along with
harmful bacteria. This causes an overgrowth of E. coli in
the vagina. In one study, the risk for UTI increased during the
15 to 28 days that women were taking antibiotics. In fact, some
research suggests that antibiotics taken for a urinary tract infection
increases the risk for a subsequent infection.
Medical
Conditions that Increase Risk for UTIs
AIDS and Immunosuppressed
Patients. Any infection is dangerous in people whose immune
systems are damaged, and UTIs are no exception, particularly pyelonephritis.
HOW
SERIOUS IS A URINARY TRACT INFECTION?
Emotional
Distress
In the great
majority of women with recurrent UTIs, urinary discomfort and emotional
distress are the primary concern. One study reported significant
impairment of a woman's quality of life during symptom periods,
which affected social function, vitality, and emotional well being.
Medical
Complications of Urinary Tract Infections in Adults
Nearly all urinary
tract infections are mild, treatable, and have no long-term consequences.
Serious physical complications can occur in some cases, however,
most often in hospitalized patients:
Obstruction and Widespread Infection. Very severe upper
urinary tract infections may cause obstruction that results in widespread
and even life-threatening infection. Patients who develop UTIs in
the hospital are at higher risk for such infections than those whose
infections develop in the community. A particularly dangerous form
of kidney infection obstructs the ureter. In such cases, mortality
rates are over 40%. The condition should be suspected in diabetics
who have severe UTIs with a slow response to antibiotics.
Kidney Damage. In high-risk adults, recurrent UTIs may cause
scarring in the kidneys, which over time can progressively damage
the kidney and lead to hypertension and kidney failure. People with
UTIs who develop serious kidney disease from UTIs are likely to
have other predisposing diseases or structural abnormalities. (Recurrent
urinary tract infections, even in the kidney, almost never lead
to progressive kidney damage in otherwise healthy women.)
Urge Incontinence. Recurrent UTIs may increase the risk
for urge incontinence after menopause. (People with urge incontinence
experience leakage and the need to urinate frequently.)
Kidney Stones. Kidney stones can be caused by urinary
tract infections (as well increase the risk for UTIs in the first
place). Those known as struvite stones are almost always caused
by urinary tract infections due to bacteria that secrete certain
enzymes. These enzymes raise urine concentrations of ammonia, which
composes the crystals forming struvite stones. The stone-promoting
bacterium is usually Proteus, but others include Pseudomonas,
Klebsiella, Providencia, Serratia, and staphylococci.
Complications
of Urinary Tract Infections in Pregnancy
Urinary tract
infections during pregnancy pose particular risks for both mother
and child:
If asymptomatic
bacteriuria is not detected and treated promptly in pregnant
women, as many as 25% develop kidney infection (pyelonephritis),
which in turn increases the risk for premature birth, infant
mortality, and later chronic kidney disease.
According
to a 2000 study, even if kidney infection does not develop,
untreated UTIs occurring in the first and third trimester of
pregnancy increase the risk for mental retardation and developmental
delay in the infant from 1.2% to 2%.
Certain
strains of E. coli can increase the risk for complications
during pregnancy, including miscarriage or premature delivery,
even if pyelonephritis does not develop.
Infants
of women who harbor Ureaplasma urealyticum also have
increased risk for respiratory infections.
Complications
in Children with Urinary Tract Infections
Urinary tract
infections are a major cause of hospitalization in children and,
untreated, can be very serious, particularly in children under four
years old. Fortunately, with prompt treatment childhood cases of
upper urinary tract infections rarely cause any serious consequences.
Widespread infection is a major complication of a primary infection.
In children who develop serious or recurrent UTIs, a greater concern
is kidney scarring. This occurrence in young growing kidneys is
much more serious than in the mature kidney. Over the years, it
increases the risk for hypertension and kidney failure. In one study,
evidence of scarring developed in 6% of children who had been hospitalized
for a urinary tract infection. Children most at risk for this complication
include the following:
Children
with vesicoureteric reflux. (Carefully managed vesicoureteric
reflux without scarring is not associated with serious complications.)
Abnormally
structured urinary tracts.
Recurrent
kidney infections.
A delay
in treating an acute UTI.
One encouraging
2000 study followed children with evidence of kidney scarring for
16 to 26 years. On average, their total kidney function was well
preserved, although the scarred kidney had signs of lower function
and patients with scarring in both kidneys were at higher risk for
future problems. Earlier studies have shown poorer results, which,
evidence suggests, are now improving with early detection and better
follow-up.
WHICH
TESTS WILL CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS?
A physical examination
and urine samples are the standard initial tests both to diagnose
urinary tract infections and rule out other conditions. These tests
may not be necessary if the patient has clear-cut UTI symptoms,
including frequent urination and, in women, vaginal burning, without
other complications, such as fever, chills, and pain in the kidney.
In such cases, a phone call may confirm the diagnosis, and the physician
can call in a prescription for antibiotics to the pharmacy. Increasingly,
a nurse rather than a physician is consulted for uncomplicated urinary
tract infections. A good response to antibiotic therapy usually
eliminates the need for further tests. Pregnant women should be
screened for E. coli because of the risk of complications,
including miscarriage, form certain strains of this bacteria.
Ruling
Out Other Conditions with Similar Symptoms
Studies have
shown that up to 40% of women with symptoms of cystitis have so-called
sterile urine, in which the bacterial count is lower than that which
would normally cause an infection. Such cases may be caused by irritation
of the urethra, vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, or sexually transmitted
diseases. Some of these problems may also accompany or lead to UTIs.
Vaginitis. Vaginitis is a common problem caused by a fungal
infection (candidiasis), by bacteria, or by sexually transmitted
diseases. Occasionally, the infection causes frequent urination,
mimicking cystitis. The typical symptoms of vaginitis are itching
and an abnormal discharge.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Women with painful urination
but whose urine does not exhibit signs of bacterial growth in culture
may have a sexually transmitted disease. The most common culprit
is the organism Chlamydia trachomatis . Other STDs that may
be responsible include gonorrhea and genital herpes.
Interstitial Cystitis. Interstitial cystitis (IC) is an
inflammation of the bladder wall that occurs almost predominantly
in women. The average age of patients with IC is 40, but 25% of
cases occur in women under 30. Symptoms are very similar to cystitis,
but no bacteria are present. Pain during sex is a very common symptom
and stress may intensify symptoms.
Bladder Cancer. Bladder cancer is a rare cause of painful
urination and is more common in men than in women.
Kidney Stones. The pain of kidney stones along with blood
in the urine can resemble the symptoms of pyelonephritis. There
are no bacteria present with kidney stones, however.
Thinning Urethral and Vaginal Walls. After menopause, the
vaginal and urethral walls become dry and fragile causing pain and
irritation that can mimic a UTI.
Disorders in Children that Mimic UTIs. Problems that might
cause painful urination in children include reactions to chemicals
in bubble bath, diaper rashes, and infection from the pinworm parasite.
Prostate Conditions in Men. Prostate conditions, including
prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and benign prostatic
hyperplasia, can cause symptoms similar to urinary tract infections.
Physical
Examination
During an exam,
the physician should examine the pelvic and vaginal area in women.
Men require a digital rectal examination to determine if prostate
enlargement is present. The physician will also examine the male
genitals for signs of infection. In both men and women, the physician
should also check the abdomen and areas around the kidneys for swelling
and tenderness.
Urine
Samples
Clean-Catch
Sample. A clean-catch sample for UTI depends on a sample free
of contaminants normally present at the opening of the urethra (eg,
white blood cells and bacteria unrelated to UTIs). To obtain an
untainted urine sample, physicians usually request a so-called midstream,
or clean-catch, urine sample. To provide this, the following steps
are taken:
Patients
must first wash their hands thoroughly, then wash the penis
or vulva and surrounding area four times, with front-to-back
strokes, using a new soapy sponge each time.
The patient
must then begin urinating into the toilet and stop after a few
drops.
The patient
then positions the container to catch the middle portion of
the stream. Ideally, this urine will contain only the bacteria
and other evidence of the urinary tract infection.
The patient
then urinates the remainder into the toilet.
The patient
securely screws the container cap in place without touching
the inside of the rim.
For the majority
of cases of suspected cystitis, this sample is considered adequate.
In fact, a 2000 study reported that the clean-catch sample had identical
contamination rates as a simple urine sample taken with no precautions.
Researchers in the study suggested that in young, sexually active
women with symptoms of cystitis, a urine sample may not even be
necessary.
Collection with a Catheter. Some patients (eg, small children,
elderly people, or hospitalized patients), cannot provide a urine
sample. In such cases, a catheter may be inserted into the bladder
to collect urine. This is the best method for providing a contaminant-free
sample.
Testing the Sample. The sample is generally given to the
physician or sent to the laboratory for analysis. Other procedures
are available as well.
Dipstick
Tests. Dipstick tests employ a chemical on a stick dipped
in urine that reacts to nitrite. Nitrite is produced by the
bacteria that cause UTI. These tests detect about 90% of infections
and are useful for women with recurrent UTIs. They may also
be useful for identifying UTIs in children and infants. Home
dipstick urine tests are now available without prescription.
Incontinence
Pads. Testing and diagnosing UTIs in elderly patients who
are incontinent is especially difficult, because of the similarities
in symptoms. Researchers have found that pressing a dipstick
into an incontinence pad is an effective way to screen for urinary
tract infections in incontinent patients.
Urinalysis
A urinalysis
involves a physical and chemical examination of urine. In addition,
the urine is spun in a centrifuge to allow sediments containing
blood cells, bacteria, and other particles to collect. This sediment
is then examined under a microscope. A urinalysis, then, offers
a number of valuable clues for an accurate diagnosis:
Simply
observing the urine for color and cloudiness can be important.
Acidity
is measured.
White
blood cells (leukocytes) are counted. A high count in the urine
is referred to as pyuria. (A leukocyte count over 10
per microliter is considered to indicate pyuria.) Pyuria is
usually sufficient for a diagnosis of UTI in nonhospitalized
patients if standard symptoms (or just fever in small children)
are also present.
Treatment can
be started without the need for further tests if the following urinalysis
results are present in patients with symptoms and signs of UTIs:
A high
white cell count.
Cloudy
urine.
Gram
Stain
If physicians
suspect that bacteria other than E. coli may be present,
a Gram stain is used to help predict the species. This is a staining
procedure used to make bacteria visible through a microscope. Many
bacteria are categorized by the terms gram-positive and gram-negative.
Bacteria
that are pink are called gram-negative.
Those
that turn blue from the stain are called gram-positive bacteria.
Escherichia
coli is gram negative and the most common cause of UTIs. If
physicians suspect that bacteria other than E. coli are
present in cases of UTI, a Gram stain is useful for identifying
other species.
Urine
Culture
A urine culture
is a urine specimen observed 24 to 48 hours in a laboratory for
the presence of any bacterial growth. It is not routinely performed
but may be conducted under certain circumstances:
If urinalysis
is negative but the patient has severe UTI symptoms, particularly
in hospitalized patients with catheters who develop fever or
other signs of infection.
If the
infection is recurrent.
If the
physician suspects complications.
In girls
less than two years with a high fever of unknown origin that
lasts two days or more.
Even if bacteria
are present in the culture, a diagnosis of UTI depends on symptoms
and gender:
Even without
symptoms, the presence in a culture of at least 100,000 colonies
of any single type of bacterium per milliliter of urine usually
provides conclusive evidence of infection in women.
In women
who experience pain while urinating, a diagnosis of infection
is made with as low a count as 100 colonies per milliliter.
(One study found that half of women who had low counts in an
initial specimen progressed to high counts in two days.)
Men are
considered to have an infection with a count of only 1,000.
Urinary tract
infection is nearly always caused by a single species of bacteria.
If a mix of different species is found, the test is considered contaminated
and is redone.
Cultures have limitations. For example, even if E. coli
is indicated, researchers are recognizing variants of this bacteria.
Certain types may indicate a higher risk for a second infection,
while others may even be protective against recurring infections.
Furthermore, some organisms, such as Chlamydia, are not detected
using ordinary cultures and require special tests. Indications for
such tests may be the presence of pus in bacteria but no bacterial
growth.
Investigative
Tests
An interesting
test called the Diag-Nose is under investigation in England.
The test first involves mixing urine with a specific growth medium,
which the bacteria eat. They then emit characteristic odors that
are detected by the device and identified as UTI bacteria. More
research is warranted.
Imaging
Techniques
Because of the
expense and the limited accuracy of imaging procedures, these techniques
are used only for the following:
Serious
and recurrent cases of pyelonephritis.
When structural
abnormalities are suspected.
If infections
do not respond to treatment.
If a physician
suspects obstruction or an abscess.
As follow-up
care in children.
Ultrasound.
Ultrasound is a noninvasive, risk-free imaging test that can be
used to screen for hydronephrosis (obstructions of the flow of urine),
kidney stones that predispose to infection, and kidney abscesses.
Ultrasounds of the prostate in men with UTI can detect enlargement
or abscesses. In children with urinary tract infections they also
can be used to detect vesicoureteral reflux, the defect of the valve-like
mechanism between the ureter and bladder. They are not as accurate
as voiding cystourethrography [see below].
Nuclear Scans. Imaging techniques called nuclear scans may
be useful in certain cases. One such scan called dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scintigraphy first employs injections of tiny amounts
of radioactive tracing medicine. A scanning machine (scintillation
or gamma camera) is then used to detect pictures of the tracer in
the kidney. This information is recorded on a computer screen or
on film. Nuclear scans are very useful for detecting kidney scarring
after pyelonephritis in children. They produce better images and
expose the patient to far less radiation than x-rays do.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and computed tomography (CT)
scans are noninvasive advanced imaging techniques that are sometimes
used when nuclear scans are inconclusive. A CT scan is useful for
ruling out kidney stones or obstructions in women with recurrent
UTIs.
X-Rays. Special x-rays can be used to screen for structural
abnormalities, urethral narrowing, or incomplete emptying of the
bladder, which can cause stagnation of urine and predispose to infection.
Voiding
cystourethrogram is an x-ray of the bladder and urethra.
To obtain a cystourethrogram, a dye, called contrast material,
is injected through a catheter inserted into the urethra and
passed through the bladder.
An intravenous
pyelogram (IVP) is an x-ray of the kidney. For a pyelogram,
the contrast matter is injected into a vein and eliminated by
the kidneys. In both cases, the dye passes through the urinary
tract and reveals any obstructions or abnormalities on x-ray
images. Due to the possible risks to the fetus, x-rays are not
performed on pregnant women.
Cystoscopy.
Cystoscopy is used to detect structural abnormalities, interstitial
cystitis, or masses that might not show up on x-rays during an IVP.
The patient is given a light anesthetic and the bladder is filled
with water. The procedure uses a cystoscope, a flexible, tube-like
instrument that the urologist inserts through the urethra into the
bladder.
Other
Diagnostic Tests for Kidney Infection and Severe UTIs
No noninvasive
test will differentiate between upper and lower urinary tract infections.
This is a particular problem because of the high percentage of women
whose cystitis symptoms mask infections that also exist in the upper
tract.
Antibiotic Trial. The best current test for pyelonephritis
is the short-term antibiotic therapy given for cystitis. If the
infection returns within two weeks after treatment, upper urinary
tract infection is usually present.
Blood Cultures. If symptoms are severe, blood cultures will
be taken to determine if the infection is in the blood stream and
threatening other parts of the body.
WHAT
ARE THE TREATMENTS FOR SYMPTOMS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Although antibiotics
successfully treat most urinary tract infections, severe symptoms
can persist for several days before treatment starts and then effectively
eliminates the bacteria. (One study revealed that many women who
suffer from UTIs often wait one or two days before seeing a physician.
As a result, up to another two or more days may pass before treatments
can relieve symptoms.) A number of options are available for treating
symptoms until the antibiotics are effective. It should be stressed
that all of these drugs treat only symptoms and are not cures; they
should never be used to replace antibiotics.
Phenazopyridine
Phenazopyridine
(Barodium, Eridium, AZO Standard) relieves pain and burning caused
by the infection. It should not be taken for more than two days
and should be discontinued when symptoms are relieved. Side effects
include headache and stomach distress. The drug turns urine a red
or orange color, which can stain fabric and be difficult to remove.
In rare cases, it can cause serious side effects, including shortness
of breath, a bluish skin, a sudden reduction in urine output, shortness
of breath, and confusion. In such cases, patients should call the
physician immediately.
Antispasm
Agents
Drugs that reduce
bladder spasms include methenamine (Atrosept, Prosed, Urised) or
flavoxate (Urispas). These agents can have severe side effects that
the patient should discuss with the physician.
HOW
ARE ANTIBIOTICS USED IN TREATING URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS?
A variety of
antibiotics are available for UTIs. The choices depend on many factors,
including whether the infection is complicated or uncomplicated,
primary or recurrent. Treatment decisions should not necessarily
be based on the actual bacteria count. If a woman has symptoms,
even if bacterial count is low or normal, infection is probably
present and antibiotic treatment should be considered.
[See Box Specific
Antibiotics Used in UTIs.]
Specific Antibiotics Used for Most UTIs
Amoxicillin.
Until recent years, the standard treatment for a UTI was ten
days of amoxicillin, a penicillin antibiotic, but it is now
ineffective against E. coli bacteria in up to 25% of cases.
TMP-SMX. The current typical treatment is a three-day
course of the combination drug trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Cotrim, Septra). It should
not be used in patients whose infections occurred after dental
work or in patients allergic to sulfa drugs. Allergic reactions
can be very serious. TMP-SMX interferes with the effectiveness
of oral contraceptives. Trimethoprin (Proloprim, Trimpex)
or sulfamethoxazole (Thiosulfil, Forte) may be used alone
or in combination.
Fluoroquinolones. Antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones
(also called quinolones) are now standard alternatives to
TMP-SMX. Examples of quinolones include ciprofloxacin (Cipro),
norfloxacin (Noroxin), ofloxacin (Floxacin), levofloxacin
(Levaquin), and sparfloxacin. These antibiotics are expensive
and, in general, are used only for the following conditions:
Complicated UTIs.
In patients who do not respond TMP-SMX.
In patients who are allergic to TMP-SMX.
In communities where there are high rates of bacteria
resistant to TMP-SMX.
Pregnant
women should not take them.
Cephalosporins. Antibiotics known as cephalosporins,
either second generation (cefuroxime axetil, cefaclor, cefprozil)
or third generation (cefixime, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime) are
also alternatives for infections that do not respond to standard
treatments.
Tetracyclines. Long-term treatment with tetracycline
or doxycycline (both are tetracyclines) may be used for infections
that are caused by Mycoplasma or Chlamydia.
Tetracyclines have unique side effects among antibiotics,
including skin reactions to sunlight, possible burning in
the throat, and tooth discoloration.
Nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrodantin)
is an antibiotic that is used specifically for urinary tract
infections. It should not be used in patients with kidney
disease. It interacts with many drugs and other chronic or
serious medical conditions may also affect its use. It should
not be used in pregnant women within a week or two of delivery
or in nursing mothers.
Fosfomycin. The antibiotic fosfomycin (Monurol), which
comes in an orange-flavored, soluble powder, may prove to
be an effective one-dose treatment for many women, including
those who are pregnant.
Aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides are given by injection
for very serious bacterial infections, gentamicin is an example.
Antibiotics
for Uncomplicated UTIs
Oral antibiotic
treatment cures 85% of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although
the rate of recurrence remains high. There is some debate over whether
to treat young sexually-active women with high bacterial counts
but no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). Given growing bacterial
resistance to antibiotics and the benign nature of this condition,
many experts do not recommend routine treatment.
Specific Antibiotics Used. The antibiotics used most often
for uncomplicated UTIs are either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Cotrim, Septra), or an antibiotic
known as a fluoroquinolone. Pregnant women should not take fluoroquinolones.
For uncomplicated UTIs, better options during pregnancy may be sulfisoxazole
or a cephalosporin. [See Box
Specific Antibiotics Used for Most UTIs.]
Duration of Treatment. Studies are now reporting that uncomplicated
female UTIs can often be successfully treated over the phone. In
such cases, a health professional, usually a nurse, provides the
patients with three-day antibiotic regimens without even requiring
a urine test. A single oral dose of antibiotics, usually
TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone, is sometimes prescribed in mild cases,
but cure rates are generally lower than with the three-day regimens.
(Long-term therapy, seven- to ten-day course, is now mostly limited
to men, children, the elderly, people with diabetes with any UTI,
and women with pyelonephritis or who are pregnant.) After a week
of antibiotic treatment, most patients are free of infection. If
the symptoms do not clear up within the first few days of therapy,
physicians generally suggest that women discontinue their antibiotic
and provide a urine sample for culturing in order to identify the
specific organism causing the condition.
Treatment
for Relapsing Infection
A relapsing infection
(caused by the same organisms the first episode) occurs within three
weeks in about 10% of women. Relapse is treated similarly to a first
infection but the antibiotics are continued for at least two weeks.
(Relapsing infections may be due to structural abnormalities, abscesses,
or other problems that may require surgery, and such conditions
should be ruled out.)
Bacterial
Resistance to Antibiotics
Of major concern for physicians and the public is the emergence
of strains of common bacteria, including E. coli ,
that are resistant to specific antibiotics. The prevalence
of such bacteria has dramatically increased worldwide, and,
although resistance is highest to penicillin, it is also increasing
rapidly to other antibiotics. More than 20% of E. coli
bacteria are now resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin,
and sulfamethoxazole. The percentage is growing with TMP-SMX.
(In the US, higher rates are observed in Western states.)
E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin, gentamicin, and
ciprofloxacin is still under 2%, but as these drugs are increasingly
used, resistant bacterial will also increase. (It should be
noted that such resistance has not yet had any significant
effect on antibiotic treatments for infections outside the
hospital setting. To date this problem will not effect most
people.)
Antibiotic
Treatment and Prevention of Reinfections
By six weeks,
the rate of reinfection is 18% among those taking TMP-SMX and may
be up to 40% in patients taking short-term therapy of other types
of antibiotics. All women with an initial episode of UTI should
use hygienic measures to prevent recurrences. [ See How Can
Urinary Tract Infections Be Prevented?]
Self Treatment. A number of studies now suggest that many,
if not most, women with recurrent UTIs can accurately self-diagnose
an infection and self treat recurrent UTIs without going to a physician:
As soon
as the patient develops symptoms, she takes the antibiotic.
Infections that occur less than twice a year are usually treated
as if they were an initial attack, with single dose or three-day
antibiotic regimens.
At that
time, she also performs a clean-catch urine test and sends it
to the physician for culturing to confirm the infection.
A physician should
be consulted under the following circumstances:
If the
symptoms have not completely resolved within 48 hours.
If there
is a change in symptoms.
If the
patient suspects that she is pregnant.
If the
patient has more than four infections a year.
Women who are
not good candidates for self-treatment are those with impaired immune
systems, previous kidney infections, structural abnormalities of
the urinary tract, or a history of infection with antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.
Preventive Antibiotics (Prophylaxis). Prophylaxis (preventive
antibiotics) are an option for women who experience two or more
symptomatic UTIs within six months or three or more over the course
of year. A woman's own perception of discomfort should guide her
decisions on whether to use preventive antibiotics or not. The increasing
use of antibiotics for many common infections is causing concern
because of emerging strains of common bacteria that have become
resistant to standard antibiotics. [ See Box Bacterial
Resistance to Antibiotics.].
Regimens for Recurrent Infections.
Preventive regimens for recurrent infections may vary depending
on the circumstances:
The physician
may prescribe continuous preventive low-dose antibiotics for
six months to a year. Typical regimens include one dose of nitrofurantoin
(50 mg), 1/2 tablet of TMP-SMX, or cephalexin (250 mg). Taking
the antibiotic at bedtime may be most effective. (Taking TMP-SMX
for as long as five years has been reported to be effective
and well tolerated.)
If the
infection is related to sexual activity and episodes recur more
than three times a year, a single preventive dose taken immediately
after intercourse has proven to be very effective in many cases.
Effective antibiotics in such cases include, TMP-SMX, nitrofurantoin,
cephalexin, or a fluoroquinolone (such as ciprofloxacin). (Fluoroquinolone
are not appropriate during pregnancy.)
In elderly
people with frequent recurrences, half doses of trimethoprim
are beneficial.
Antibiotics
for Kidney Infection
Treating Uncomplicated
Kidney Infections. Patients with uncomplicated kidney infections
(pyelonephritis) are those who are not experiencing nausea or vomiting
and show no other overt symptoms of kidney involvement. Sometimes
patients are first given an antibiotic injection, if indicated.
In general, the standard treatment for uncomplicated pyelonephritis
is a 14-day course of oral antibiotics, usually trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(TMP-SMX) or ampicillin. A 2000 study reported, however, that a
seven day course of ciprofloxacin was as effective for patients
with uncomplicated kidney infections as 14 days of TMP-SMX.) In
any case, a urine culture is obtained within one week of completion
of therapy and again four weeks later.
Treating Moderate to Severe Kidney Infection. Patients with
moderate to severe acute kidney infection and those with severe
symptoms or other complications may need to be hospitalized. In
such cases, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and gentamicin) are usually
given intravenously for three to five days or until symptoms are
relieved and patients have not shown any signs of fever for 24 to
48 hours.
One study reported that oral cefixime may be as effective as intravenous
antibiotics in small children with UTIs and fever. In any case,
adult patients are switched to oral antibiotic therapy after symptoms
have been relieved and continued for another two weeks; treatment
for longer than this has no additional benefit. If fever and back
pain persist after 72 hours of antibiotic administration, the physician
will usually order imaging tests to see if abscesses, obstructions,
or other abnormalities are present. [ See Diagnostic Tests
for Pyelonephritis and Acutely Ill Patients, above.]
Treating Chronic Kidney Infections. Patients with chronic
pyelonephritis are often treated with long-term antibiotic therapy,
even during periods when they are asymptomatic.
Treating the Pregnant Woman with Kidney Infections. Pregnant
women with pyelonephritis have, to date, been hospitalized for treatment,
but a recent study found that outpatient treatment is safe and effective
if the condition develops in the early months of pregnancy. In the
study, women were given an injection of ceftriaxone in the emergency
room, observed for a few hours and then administered a second injection.
After this, they were sent home with a prescription for an oral
antibiotic.
Antibiotics
for Urethritis in Men
Urethritis in
men has typically been treated with a seven-day regimen of doxycycline.
Some research is showing that a single dose of azithromycin may
be just as effective while causing fewer side effects. One-dose
treatment also improves compliance, so cure rates may even be better
than with a long-term regimen. Of concern, however, is an infection
that spreads to the prostate gland, which is harder to treat, so
most physicians still prefer the longer regimen. It should be noted
that azithromycin and similar antibiotics do not cure the infection
and may mask the symptoms of an accompanying sexually transmitted
disease, such as gonorrhea. Tests for such diseases should be conducted
if urethritis is diagnosed.
Preventive
Treatments for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux
Antibiotics are
often used to prevent infections in children (particularly girls)
with vesicoureteral reflux. The current choices include low doses
of nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim. The treatment usually continues
for years with the idea that the condition will resolve when the
child has grown.
The use of long-term antibiotics for preventing infections in children
is controversial, however, and few well-conducted studies have been
performed to confirm or refute their use. In one 2000 study, treatment
was stopped after an average of 4.8 years. Reflux had resolved in
only about 20% of the children (whose average age was nearly nine).
UTIs occurred, however, in just 12% of the children after an average
of 2.3 years following the end of the antibiotic regimen. Furthermore,
another 2000 study suggested that children on preventive antibiotics
were at higher than average risk for developing infections with
resistant bacteria.
Surgery to correct the reflux is the alternative when the condition
does not resolve over time with antibiotics. Debate is ongoing over
whether surgery might be a better first option than long-term antibiotics.
Studies are finding no significant difference in kidney damage between
children who are treated with antibiotics or surgery.
WHAT ARE THE NON-ANTIBIOTIC MEASURES FOR PREVENTING RECURRENT
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS?
General
Female Hygiene
The following
hygiene tips may be helpful for women at risk for UTIs:
Cleanse
the genital and urinary areas from front to back with soap and
water after each bowel movement.
Avoid
tight-fitting pants.
Wear cotton-crotch
underwear and panty hose, changing both at least once a day.
(Mild detergents are best for washing underwear.)
Take showers
rather than baths.
Avoid
bath oils, feminine hygiene sprays, douches, and powders. In
fact, as a general rule, any product containing perfumes or
other possible allergens should not be used near the genital
area.
Choose
sanitary napkins instead of tampons (which some physicians believe
encourage infection). Napkins and tampons, in any case, should
be changed after each urination.
Urinate
frequently.
Sexual
Precautions
The following
recommendations may reduce the risks from sexual activity:
Keep the
genital and anal areas clean before and after sex.
Urinate
before and after intercourse to empty the bladder and cleanse
the urethra of bacteria. Note: these precautions are not proven
to prevent UTIs.
Discuss
the best contraceptive choice with a physician; this is for
women who don't want to get pregnant and who also want to reduce
the risk for UTIs. For example, women in a monogamous relationship
(in which both partners are at low risk for sexually transmitted
disease) should consider contraceptive devices that don't contain
spermicides. [ See also the Report, #91
Female Contraception.] Uncoated condoms do not pose a risk for
recurrent UTIs, but the friction they produce in use may pose
a risk for infection. Uncoated condoms are also not as protective
against sexually transmitted diseases.
Avoid
sex with multiple partners. This causes many psychologic and
health problems, including sexually transmitted diseases and
UTIs.
Estrogen
Studies are finding
that postmenopausal women who use an estrogen vaginal cream or estrogen-releasing
vaginal ring (Estring) have a significantly lower incidence of recurring
urinary tract infections than women not using such topical estrogens.
Researchers suggest that estrogen may resist infection by increasing
the number of lactobacilli, the microorganism that fights infection
by lowering the vaginal pH levels and preventing E. coli
from adhering to vaginal cells. It is not clear whether taking oral
estrogen has the same benefit as the topical forms. Studies of oral
estrogen to date have been contradictory; some have, in fact, reported
a higher incidence of UTI in women taking oral estrogen.
Dietary Considerations
Fluids. Many physicians believe that emptying the bladder
frequently will help prevent bladder irritation and therefore recommend
drinking plenty of water daily and urinating often. Alcohol and
coffee should be avoided.
Cranberry Juice and Blueberries. Cranberries and blueberries
are two of the three fruits native to North America. During the
Colonial period, cranberries were used to alleviate fever and were
also used for liver and stomach problems. Cranberry juice offers
well-known protection against urinary tract infections. In one study,
only 15% of elderly women who drank 300 ml (1.25 cups) of cranberry
juice daily for six months experienced UTIs compared with 28% of
women who did not drink the juice. Its effects were stronger in
helping the body rid itself of infections than in preventing them
in the first place, but it showed benefits in both situations. Furthermore,
a 2001 study showed that women who drank 2 oz. of cranberry juice
had fewer UTIs than women taking nothing after 6 months.
Researchers are finding that chemicals in cranberries and blueberries
called tannins, or proanthocyanidins, prevent the E. coli
bacteria from adhering to cells in the urinary tract. Fructose,
which is present in all fruit juices, may also interfere with bacterial
adhesion.
Vitamin C. Taking vitamin C regularly may make urine more
acidic and less hospitable to bacteria, but there is no evidence
that it prevents UTIs.
Probiotics
Lactobacilli.
Some researchers are investigating probiotics (essentially
friendly organisms), particularly lactobacilli, which may
protect against infections in the genital and urinary tracts. Many
yogurt products contain lactobacilli. Lactobacilli are also
found in acidophilus, a natural supplement. Lactobacilli
have the potential to help protect women from UTIs in a number of
ways:
Maintain
a low pH environment.
Hinder
E. coli growth.
Produce
hydrogen peroxide, which produces an environment hostile for
bacteria.
Escherichia
Coli 83972. E. coli 83972 is being investigated because
it is an E. coli strain associated with asymptotic conditions
in the urinary tract. Some research suggests that it may even be
protective in certain individuals.
Vaccines
Vaccines are
being developed against urinary tract infections. There is some
urgency in the need for such vaccines, as bacterial strains resistant
to many common antibiotics are becoming increasingly prevalent.
In an early trial of the vaccine SolcoUrovac, after five months,
antibodies to the infection were increased significantly in the
urinary tracts of women with recurrent UTIs. More studies are needed
to determine long-term effects. A vaccine administered as a suppository
in the vagina has helped some women develop resistance to recurrent
infection. Investigators are also testing a vaccine that prevents
E. coli from attaching to the lining of the bladder.
Circumcision
in Infant Males
Although there
is some controversy over whether circumcision helps prevent UTIs
in boys, a 2000 analysis of nearly 15,000 male infants born in
1996 reported that the uncircumcised boys under one years old
had nine times the risk for UTIs as circumcised boys. (The risk
is still very low, however.)
MANAGEMENT OF CATHETER-INDUCED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Preventing Catheter-Induced Infections
Catheter-induced
urinary tract infections are very common and preventive measures
are extremely important. Catheters should not be used unless
absolutely necessary, and they should be removed as soon as
possible. One study found that catheters impregnated with
antibiotics reduced UTI rates during the two weeks they were
in place after surgery. Reducing the risk for infections during
long-term catheter use, however, is problematic.
Catheter Coatings. Catheter coatings, such as silver
nitrate and other substances, are being tested and are showing
some benefits, but the problem is still not resolved.
Intermittent Use of Catheters. If a catheter is required
for long periods, it is best to use it intermittently if possible
(as opposed to an indwelling catheters). Some physicians recommend
replacing it every two weeks to reduce the risk of infection
and irrigating the bladder with antibiotics between replacements.
Daily Hygiene. A typical catheter is one that has been
preconnected and sealed and uses a drainage bag system. To
prevent infection, some of the following tips may be helpful:
Drink plenty of fluids, including three glasses of cranberry
juice a day.
The catheter tube should be free of any knots or kinks.
Clean the catheter and the area around the urethra with
soap and water daily and after each bowel movement. (Women
should be sure to clean front to back.)
Wash hands before touching the catheter or surrounding
area.
Never disconnect the catheter from the drainage bag without
careful instructions from a health professional on strict
methods for preventing infection.
Keep the drainage bag off the floor.
Stabilize the bag against the leg using tape or some other
system.
Antibiotics for Catheter-Induced Infections
Patients
using catheters who develop UTI with symptoms should be treated
for each episode with antibiotics and the catheter should
be removed, if possible. A major problem in treating catheter-related
UTI is that the organisms involved are constantly changing.
Because there are likely to be multiple species of bacteria,
experts generally recommend an antibiotic that is effective
against a wide variety of microorganisms. These medications
include those in the fluoroquinolone group and drug combinations
such as ampicillin plus gentamicin or imipenem plus cilastatin.
Although high bacteria counts in the urine (bacteriuria) occur
in most catheterized patients, administering antibiotics to
prevent a UTI is rarely recommended. Many catheterized
patients do not develop symptomatic urinary tract infections
even with high bacteria counts. If bacteriuria occurs without
symptoms, antibiotic therapy has little benefit if the catheter
is to remain in place for a long period.

10 Ways to Prevent Urinary Tract InfectionsHow to Reduce Your Risk of UTIFrom Tracee Cornforth, former About.com GuideUpdated January 08, 2010About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the Medical Review Board

Nine million doctor's office visits each year are due to urinary tract infections, or UTIs. The only thing patients visit the doctor for more often are respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. Unfortunately, the majority of cases of UTI occur in women.
What can you do to help prevent urinary tract infections from interfering with your life? According to the National Institutes of Health, health professionals recommend the following tips to reduce your risk of developing a UTI.
Water helps flush your urinary tract, so make sure you drink plenty of plain water daily.
More: You Are What You Drink
Don't hold it when you need to urinate! Women are often guilty of trying to finish a task before they go to the bathroom. Holding it when you need to go can help any bacteria that may be present develop into a full-fledged urinary tract infection.
You've probably heard that you should wipe from front to back after a bowl movement. This is especially important to help prevent bacteria from the anus from entering the vagina or urethra.
Taking showers instead of baths helps prevent bacteria from entering the urethra and causing a UTI.
Always wash your genital area both before and after sexual intercourse to help prevent transferring bacteria to the urethra or vaginal area, which can create a breeding ground for a UTI.
More: Personal Hygiene and UTI
Feminine hygiene sprays and douches, particularly scented douches, can irritate the urethra and possibly lead to a UTI. Avoiding these products will help prevent not only urinary tract infections, but also other infections and irritations that these products may cause.
More: The Douche Debate
Drinking cranberry juice is a fairly well-known and natural way to both help prevent urinary tract infections, as well as help speed the recovery process when a UTI develops. Just drinking two 4-ounce glasses of cranberry juice daily is often enough to both prevent a UTI and speed recovery when an infection does develop.
Another nutritional route that may help prevent UTI is regularly taking vitamin C supplements. Vitamin C increases the acidity level of urine, which in turn helps decrease the number of harmful bacteria that may be present in your urinary tract system.
Always wear panties with a cotton crotch. Cotton fabric lets moisture escape while other fabrics can trap moisture, creating a potential breeding ground for bacteria.
If you are one of a large number of women who suffers from frequent, recurrent urinary tract infections, a change in your position during sexual intercourse may help reduce the number of UTIs that you experience. Changing sexual positions may reduce friction on your urethra and reduce your risk of recurrent UTI. Women who suffer from extremely frequent urinary tract infections may be prescribed an antibiotic to take immediately after sex to help prevent the likelihood of urinary tract infection occurrence.

Urinary Tract Infection
Urinary tract infection is a serious problem. It affects millions of people each year.
Detailed description of urinary tract infection (UTI), its causes, symptoms and treatment are given on this page.The Urinary TractThe urinary tract consists of the kidneys, ureters (narrow tubes), bladder and urethra. The bladder, an oval-shaped chamber, is located in the lower abdomen. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located below the ribs in the middle.The function of the kidneys is to emove extra water and wastes from the blood and converting it to urine. The ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common type of infection in our body. An infection occurs when bacteria from the digestive tract go to the opening of the urethra and multiply. Generally, the lower urinary tract is affected by the infection; this infection is known as cystitis. A urinary tract infection may be in the kidneys and /or bladder.Urinary Tract Infection SymptomsWarning signs of various diseasesBlood in urineWarning signs of CancerCancer Symptoms & causesCancer fighting foodsWarning Signs of heart attackWarning signs of strokeWarning signs of diabetesGout symptomsKidney stonesKidney stones home remediesSymptoms of Thyroid ProblemsNormal Thyroid LevelsThyroid MedicationUrinary incontinenceYou may have urinary tract infection if you have any of the following:Frequent urination: You go to the bathroom more than 8 times in a day and more than two times at night. High temperature lasting for more than 3 days should be a trigger to get the urine culture done to ascertain whether the fever is due to UTI or not. Cloudy, bad smelling, or bloody urine Painful burning urination Pressure in the lower abdomen Women feel an uncomfortable pressure above the pubic bone and in the lower pelvis. Some men feel a fullness in the rectum. If UTI is with a fever, it means that the infection has reached to the kidneys. Pain in the back or side below the ribs, nausea, or vomiting are also the signs/symptoms of infections in kidneys in adults. Children having urinary tract infections show the sign of a change in the their urinary pattern. They become irritable, loose motions, not eating properly, and have an unexplained fever. You must visit a urologist if you have any of the above symptoms. he will test your urine for pus and bacteria. The doctor may examine you with ultrasound or by a cystoscope. A cystoscope is a fiber cable attached with lenses and a light source, which allows the doctor to see inside the bladder.Urinary Tract Infection Causes or ReasonsUrinary tract infection can be caused byGenerally the urinary tract may be infected by E coli (Escherichia coli), which normally lives in the colon. E. coli is present in utensils not properly washed or washed with scrubbers containing E.coli. It is normally found in and around kitchen sinks where utensils are washed. Many restaurant utensils have been found to be infected by E. coli.The bacteria that lives on the skin near the rectum or in the vagina can enter the urinary tract through the urethra. It may also spread from the rectum to the urethra by wiping the bottom back to front.Kidney stones can obstruct the flow of urine, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. Sexual intercourse may transfer bacteria called Chlamydia and Mycoplasma from the partner. This infection requires treatment of both partners. An enlarged prostate (Urinary Incontinence) gland can slow down the flow of urine, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. People with week immune system like those having diabetes have a higher risk of urinary tract infections. Children who frequently delay urination may develop UTI. Smoking is a major known cause of bladder cancer. Urinary Tract Infection Home RemedyResearch by scientists at University of Stirling, Scotland found that cranberry juice may prevent urinary tract infections, particularly for those who have recurrent tract infections. This juice is believed to contain certain molecules that make it harder for bacterial such as E.coli to stick to cell surfaces, making it difficult for an infection to develop.A glass of coconut water (naariyal paani) can give you a quick relief. Urinary tract infections should be treated as soon as possible to avoid damage to kidneys. You should drink plenty of water to cleanse the urinary tract bacteria and also to avoid this infection. Cranberry juice or fruit may prevent urinary tract infections. Mushroom (Polyporus Umbellatus) is useful in urinary tract infections. You should not delay the urge to go for urination.You should go to a Urologist who will prescribe you pain-relieving medication or/and antibiotics to treat your urinary tract infection. Normally, a UTI is cured with 1 or 2 days of treatment. The content on this website is reviewed regularly and is updated when new information is made available.

Urinary Tract Infection occurs in the urinary tract. It is a very common infection and is the second highest contracted by the body. A UTI occurs when bacteria are able to invade and multiply inside the urinary tract. These organisms are so small and minute that they cannot be seen with the human eye. Through various studies, it has been concluded that infections occur when there is one specific bacteria present. Typically, this bacterium is a strain of Escherichia Coli E., better known as E.Coli. This bacterium is found naturally in the digestive tract, specifically, the colon. What are the symptoms? There are four different categories of a UTI. These are known as Lower UTI, bladder infection, Upper UTI and kidney infection. The lower infection is usually the first sign and occurs in the urethra and moves to the bladder. An upper infection takes place if a lower UTI is left untreated and affects the ureters and kidneys. If these two are left untreated, a kidney infection can occur. The exact symptoms a person can experience will depend upon age and what type of infection is involved. For a small child symptoms could include diarrhea, reduced appetite, fever, vomiting or nausea. For an older child, they could experience lower back pain (which could indicate an infection of the kidneys), frequent urination, incontinence, pain in the stomach or pelvic region or painful urination. For an adult, the symptoms of a lower UTI could include back pain, blood in the urine, cloudy urine, frequent urination, frequent urge to urinate, discomfort or painful urination. If experiencing any of the following it could mean an upper UTI; chills, high fever, pain in the ribs, vomiting or nausea. How to treat or avoid a urinary tract infection? Women suffer from UTIs more commonly than men do. There are a few things you can do to prevent the occurrence. Drinking plenty of water daily, not resisting the urge to urinate and when you visit the restroom, wipe from front to back. Never wipe from back to front as this could enable the bacteria from the anus to enter the urethra. Take showers and refrain from taking long baths. Make sure genital areas are thoroughly cleaned before and after any type of sexual activity. Cranberry juice has also been recommended by doctors to help prevent occurrences of a Urinary Tract Infection. It is important that you visit your physician if you notice any symptoms of a UTI. It needs to be treated quickly to avoid more serious problems. Your physician will conduct a lab test that consists of a urinalysis. After diagnoses, he or she will prescribe you an antibiotic to fight the infection. Dean Caporella is a professional broadcaster with an interest in a wide range of topics.

Urinary Tract Infections: Stop the Suffering!
Although VÄXA’s natural
methods and homeopathic solutions can prevent and relieve urinary
tract infections (bladder infections, “cystitis”), we
shouldn’t allow urinary tract infections to linger as they
could spread to the kidneys (pyelonephritis), and we don’t
want to mess with our kidneys.
Prescription antibiotics may be
needed for bacteria-caused urinary tract infections if there are
signs that infection has spread to the kidneys:
Persistent stabbing pains or pounding aches
in lower back
Fever or sweats
Sudden fatigue or exhaustion
If this happens during urinary tract infections,
take antibiotics. Finish prescription as directed.
Preventing Urinary Tract
Infections:
1. Avoid Bacteria in the Urinary
Tract and Vaginal Area:
When urinating, be sure to thoroughly finish.
Sometimes in a hurry, women tend to clench some back.
Never “hold in” for a long time.
Wipe from front to back after bowel movements,
not toward the vagina. E. coli from feces can easily enter.
Wear comfortable-fitting 100% cotton underwear.
Avoid snug nylons or silks, tights and panty hose whenever possible
- they build heat and moisture which invites bacteria. This
goes for tight jeans too!
If sexually active:
Before and after intercourse, urinate and
wash well.
Avoid birth control spermicides with “non-oxynol
9” in some diaphragm jellies, condoms and sponges –
it irritates the bladder.
2. Build Immunities with Daily Nutrition
and Supplements:
Take daily vitamins, minerals and other supplements.
See the “Women’s
Daily Needs” page
Drink lots of water. At LEAST eight 8 oz.
glasses per day.
Limit carbonated sodas, coffee and tea (carbonation
and acid are both harmful).
Drink some sugar-free cranberry juice each
week or take cranberry supplements (keeps bacteria away from
bladder walls).
Eat a sugar-free diet. Every time they’re
eaten, sugary foods lower immunity about 1%, which can be cumulative!
3. Guard Your Kidneys, Bladder and pH Balance
(acidic/alkaline content):
Douche seldom. It destroys good vaginal bacteria
and messes with your pH balance. This encourages urinary tract
infections.
Resolving Simple Urinary
Tract Infections Naturally:
For intense burning, drug store over-the-counter
remedies work very quickly (but will not cure the infection).
Restore pH balance with Buffer pH.
Keep using VÄXA Kidney Formula. It contains
the herb Uva Ursi, famous for natural antiseptic properties.
Drink as much water as possible every hour,
urinating frequently.
Refrain completely from carbonated sodas,
coffee, tea, sugars.
Take cranberry supplements and the herbs
garlic and pau d’arco (they’re naturally antibiotic
and anti-inflammatory) in tablets or capsules - at least three
times the recommended dosage spread throughout the day during
an infection.
If symptoms aren’t eliminated
within 72 hours, or they return soon, please see your doctor. Prescription
treatment may be necessary.
Taking antibiotics for Urinary
Tract Infections or any other infection may result in yeast infection.

Recurring Yeast Infections”.

Urinary Tract Infections - Symptoms, Risks & Preventions
Urinary Tract infections
At some point or another most women will experience the pain and discomfort
associated with a urinary tract infection or UTI. Urinary Tract Infections are
in fact one of the most common infections that occur in young women. Women's health surveys indicate more than
50 percent of women will report having a UTI at some point in their life.
A UTI can range in severity from infection of the bladder (cystitis) to
infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis), a much more severe form of UTI that
may cause severe complications. Most patients that have a UTI will have cystitis
that can be treated effectively with a short regimen of antibiotics.
The Biology of an Urinary Tract InfectionThe urinary tract consists of the kidneys, bladder and urethra. Bacteria
sometimes enter the urinary tract and multiply, causing an infection or UTI.
Most of these infections are confined to the bladder, however in certain cases
the bacteria can travel up to the kidneys causing a more severe infection.
Women are much more likely to contract a UTI than men. This may be due to the
fact that the urethral opening to the anus is closer in women, and the length or
the urethra prior to opening into the bladder is shorter in women, allowing the
opportunity for bacteria to pass more easily. A common cause of UTIs is
contamination by bacteria found in fecal matter, which can move up into the
bladder.
Risk Factors for Developing a Urinary Tract Infection
Sexual intercourse.
Use of spermicides, particularly when in combination with diaphragm.
New sexual partners.
Recent surgery or procedures involving the urinary tract.
Pregnancy
Compromised immune system.
The Most Common Symptoms of a UTI Symptoms of a UTI vary from person to person. In some mild cases no symptoms
may be present. The overwhelming majority of women with a UTI will present
however with some or all of the following:
Frequent urge to urinate, with little output.
Pain or burning during urination.
Blood in the urine.
Pain in the lower abdomen.
The symptoms of a UTI are sometimes different in pregnant women, who may
experience nausea in addition to burning. It is important if you suspect a UTI
that you seek out medical attention. The symptoms of a UTI often mimic other
conditions including vaginitis, which may cause burning with urination or pain
with intercourse.
Infection of the kidneys is a more serious complication of a UTI, and may result
in side pain, nausea and vomiting, as well as fever.
Treatment of an Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)Treatment of a UTI typically consists of administration of antibiotics.
Increasing fluid intake may also help flush bacteria from the bladder.
Though cranberry is a popular folk remedy for relieving urinary tract infections
in women, there are no definitive studies available at this time that support
the use of cranberry juice for treating a UTI.
Urinary track infections in pregnant women need to be treated aggressively, as a simple bladder
infection is much more likely to result in a kidney infection and preterm labor.
Two percent of pregnant women have bladder infections that are asymptomatic.
The Prevention of an Urinary Tract InfectionThere are several things you can do to decrease your likelihood of contracting a
UTI.
The more common preventive methods include:
Urination after intercourse, which may help eliminate bacteria in the
vagina.
Changes in contraception, particularly among women who use spermicides
or a diaphragm.
Consumption of cranberry juice. While cranberry may not help alleviate
an existing UTI, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the juice may
decrease the ability of E. coli to stick to the urinary tract lining cells.
Increasing fluid intake post intercourse, which can help flush bacteria.

Home Remedies: What Works? What Doesn't?
You might like the idea of treating common health problems with home remedies. In some cases, such as putting cool cucumber over your eyes as a beauty treatment, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. But if you're looking for relief from a serious and painful condition, like an ulcer or a urinary tract infection, it's a good idea to know whether that home remedy has any evidence behind it. Read on to learn about home remedies that could help—and those that probably won't.
Home remedies: From successful to doubtful
Cranberry juice to prevent urinary tract infections. Cranberry juice contains flavonoids and antioxidants, which may make it difficult for ""bad"" bacteria to grow and thrive in your body. Although some clinical trials have supported the idea that cranberry juice prevents a urinary tract infection, no hard and fast evidence exists. So, even though drinking cranberry juice might be refreshing and nutritious, if you have a urinary tract infection that won't go away, you should see your doctor.
Cucumber slices for puffy eyes. One reason this idea works is that most people keep cucumbers in the refrigerator. That means they're cold, and cold reduces swelling. When sliced, they also cover your eyes close to perfectly. Other people swear by cold tea bags as eye compresses, and that works for the same reason. Another option is to use a clean cotton ball to wipe cool skim milk on the affected skin.
Salt water gargle for a sore throat. If the flu or frequent throat or mouth infections have left your throat sore, you might try warm salt water gargles or rinses to feel better and help prevent another bout. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt in a large glass of water, gargle and spit.
Garlic for colds. Some people believe that eating a lot of garlic can help prevent or fight colds. Garlic won't hurt you and could help your overall health. But the scientific jury is still out on whether increasing the amount of garlic you eat can actually give you an edge against colds.
Carrots for vision. Carrots (and other orange-colored fruits and vegetables) contain beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant. In theory, eating a diet rich in beta-carotene helps your overall health, including your vision. And though it's true that a healthy, balanced diet gives you the best chance of preserving your vision as you age, medical studies haven't shown that beta-carotene supplements have much effect on eye health.
Milk for ulcers. That cold glass of milk looks like just the thing to calm your ulcer pain. And though milk might help you feel better briefly, it doesn't actually help heal an ulcer, which is a small sore in the lining of the digestive tract. It's also possible that, in the long run, drinking large amounts of milk could make ulcers worse by increasing the acid in your stomach, which irritates those tiny sores.
Baking soda as toothpaste. You don't need baking soda to clean teeth. A dry toothbrush and water are just as good as most toothpastes. On the other hand, baking soda mixed with salt has been recommended as a mouth rinse to help reduce mouth infections, especially for people whose immune systems are compromised. For this, mix 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of warm water and rinse several times a day.
Aspirin on a tooth for pain. Swallowing an aspirin or other over-the-counter painkiller can ease a toothache, but some people try to make a painful tooth feel better by putting the aspirin directly on the enamel. That's not a good idea. This approach could cause a chemical burn to surrounding tissues, ultimately making pain worse and risking infection. Instead, try swallowing the aspirin and using a cold water rinse to manage the pain—and plan on seeing your dentist as soon as you can.
Drinking alcohol for pain. Alcohol can relax you, and some people may drink because they have chronic pain. But regularly drinking alcohol to avoid pain can be bad for your health and can cause unpleasant interactions with other pain-relieving medications you might be given.

Treat UTI Infections Naturally
UTI infections are one of the most common types of infections. They are especially prevalent among women and more than 50% of women will have a UTI at some point in their lives. If left untreated, these infections can cause serious complications. Thus, it is important to know how to treat UTI infections. UTI infections can be difficult to treat and some doctors believe that the use of antibiotics increases the likelihood of future infections. Luckily, there are many natural remedies that can be used right at home to treat UTI infections.
The most widely known remedy for UTI infections is cranberry juice. Juice should be 100% natural with no added sugars. Another option is to take cranberry extract tablets, available at your local health food store. It may be easier for you to take tablets than to drink cranberry juice throughout the day, and the tablets have been shown to be equally effective in the treatment of UTI infections.
Drinking cranberry juice is beneficial to having a clean urinary tract. Think of the urinary tract the same way that you would think of a sink. If it gets clogged with bacteria too much then it will become irritated and will not function properly.
Vitamin C, like the cranberry juice remedy, is high in acidity and can be used as a treatment for uti. Taking 1000 milligrams per day can help restore the balance of the urinary tract and can also help prevent future bladder infections as well.
Having good hygiene is important if you have a chronic UTI. Women should wipe themselves front to back when they use the bathroom. Women who have poor hygiene habits often wipe back to front which can cause fecal mater to enter the urinary tract. This creates bacteria in the urinary tract which causes recurrent urinary tract infections to occur.
A product is available that can do all of these things in one all natural, herbal supplement. Urizol (www.urizol.com) is a herbal supplement that contains many ingredients that will fight any signs of infection in your urinary tract. It contains asparagus, a diruetic which will flush out your system. Urizol also contains cranberry and juniper to destry and prevent growth of bacteria. Urizol cleans and disinfects your urinary tract with an ingredient called Buchu. Buchu is a plant commonly used as a urinary tract disinfectant. Echinacea is also added to Urizol to boost your immune system and help fight infection. And to soothe your urinary tract, Urizol contains Marshmallow mucilage, which is commonly used for both UTI’s and kidney stones. Urizol is wonderful alternative to the expense of antibiotics, which can wreak havoc on your digestive system and have unpleasant side effects.

Health Benefits of Cranberries
Urinary Tract Infections
In the last six years, medical research has clinically confirmed that cranberries can play an important role in maintaining urinary tract health. In a study conducted by a team of Harvard researchers in 1994, elderly women who drank 300ml of cranberry juice daily reduced their odds of having infection by 58%. In a follow-up study published in October 1998, scientists from Rutgers University confirmed the Harvard study by pinpointing the compound existing in cranberries that prevents bacteria from adhering to cells of the urinary tract. Cranberries have what Rutgers researchers call ""anti-adhesion"" properties that significantly reduce the risk of urinary tract infections.
Periodontal Disease
In December 1998, a team of researchers from Tel Aviv University determined that the same ""anti-adhesion"" properties that prevent bacteria from forming in the urinary tract prevent bacteria from forming in the mouth. They discovered that the ""anti-adhesion"" compound that exists in cranberries also reduces the amount of oral bacteria. By creating a ""bacteria-inhibiting"" effect, cranberries minimize the formation of dental plaque, which is the leading cause of gum disease.
Heart Disease
An ongoing University of Wisconsin study is researching the cranberry’s ability to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Scientists found that cranberry extract contains antioxidants, which play a fundamental role in slowing the oxidation that leads to heart disease. One of the two biologists conducting the study states that as little as ""one-fourth of an ounce could have some benefit.""
Cancer
Cranberries contain anthocyanins, proanthocyanins and phenolic compounds that are known for their anticancer properties. Cranberries contained significantly more disease-fighting antioxidant phenols than any other fruit measured. Ongoing studies at several respected universities indicate consistent and strong evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables, including cranberries, reduces the risks of some types of cancer.

I don't know about you but
I'll bet the thought of taking your puppy to the vet for recurrent
urinary tract infections is not exactly enticing. Puppy
urinary tract infections are painful for your puppy and expensive
for pet owners. The problem is that many pet owners don't address
the problem until symptoms arise. If you work to prevent UTIs
in your puppy easily and safely at home, it will save you and
your dog a lot of trouble.
If you notice the signs of a
urinary tract infection puppy foods made commercially should
be avoided. Commercial dog food is full of artificial ingredients
and minerals that can alter the pH of your dog's urine, making
it easier for bacteria to flourish. Instead, give your dog raw,
unprocessed food and home cooked food.
In addition to giving your dog
only healthy foods, make sure your dog has plenty of fresh, filtered
water to drink. Filtered water will help your dog flush out the
bacteria that cause puppy urinary tract infections. Tap water
on the other hand is full of harmful chemicals like chlorine.
If you want to prevent urinary
tract infection puppy care that focuses on exercise and a
healthy lifestyle is very important. Many dogs do not get enough
exercise in order to maintain good health and since they don't
go outside often, they hold their urine in for too long. This
can lead to urinary tract infection over time. Make sure to take
your dog out for a walk at least twice a day.
Diet, exercise, and sufficient
intake of fresh, clean water will go a long way in preventing
puppy urinary tract infections. However, if you want to give
your dog maximum protection and boost his overall immune system
functioning, you should give him a homeopathic treatment. Homeopathy
is very helpful in both the prevention and treatment of urinary
tract infection.
So how do homeopathic remedies
work? Homeopathic remedies contain all natural plant extracts
that maintain your dog's bladder health, urinary tract health,
and a healthy flow of urine. Furthermore, homeopathic remedies
strengthen your dog's immune system so it can fight off infections
more easily. When it comes to urinary tract infection puppy homeopathy
is highly effective, particularly when combined with a healthy
diet and exercise. Best of all, homeopathic remedies are completely
safe and have no risk of side effects.
Make no mistake about it. Prevention
is always the best medicine when it comes to puppy
urinary tract infections. If you want to keep your dog healthy
and not worry at all about having to visit the vet, make sure
your dog stays healthy through good diet and exercise. Most importantly,
administer a homeopathic remedy. It's the easiest and safest
way to help your dog reach an optimum state of health.

natural remedies for a number of years. As a regular contributor,
he discusses the most promising natural treatments for dogs and
cats. To find out more about how to support your pet naturally

Think you may have a UTI?
Find a health center
If you are concerned about urinary tract infections (UTIs), you're not alone. Many women � 1 out of 5 � will experience a urinary tract infection at least once in their lives. And many women who have had a UTI will develop recurring urinary tract infections. UTIs are much less common in men than in women.
Here are some of the most common questions we hear people ask about UTIs. We hope you find the answers helpful, whether you think you may have a UTI, have been diagnosed with a UTI, or are just curious about it.
Expand All +
+-
What Are Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)?
UTIs are infections in the urinary system, including the
bladder � the organ that collects and stores urine
ureters � the tubes that lead from the kidneys to the bladder
urethra � the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body
Even though UTIs are very common, they should be taken seriously. Severe cases of urinary tract infections, left untreated, may cause kidney infection.
+-
What Are the Symptoms of a UTI?
While not everyone with a urinary tract infection (UTI) will notice symptoms, common symptoms include
burning pain during urination
an urge to urinate when your bladder is nearly empty
feeling like you need to urinate all the time, especially at night
difficulty controlling when you urinate
lower abdominal pain or back pain
blood and/or pus in your urine
fever
Be aware that these symptoms are not always caused by a UTI. Other infections, such as sexually transmitted infections, may cause burning during urination and frequent urination. Only a health care provider can tell for sure if you have a UTI. Make an appointment with your health care provider to get the correct testing and treatment.
+-
What Causes UTIs?
It is pretty easy to get a urinary tract infection (UTI). Anything that brings bacteria in contact with the vulva and/or urethra can cause a UTI. This can happen when tiny bits of feces enter the urethra during sex play or even when toilet water back splashes. Unprotected anal intercourse is a very high-risk behavior for urinary tract infections.
UTIs can also be caused by STDs. When a UTI is caused by an STD, the infection is most often only in the urethra — not the bladder.
If you are not sure how you got your UTI, don't worry. Because bacteria can so easily find its way into the urethra, it's very common for women to have UTIs without knowing the cause of the infection.
+-
Why Are Women More Likely Than Men to get UTIs?
You may have heard that urinary tract infections affect women more often than men. It's true � and the reason has to do with biology.
A woman's urethra is much shorter than a man's, making it easier for bacteria to get into the bladder.
In addition, a woman's urethra is closer to her anus than a man's is. This makes it easier for bacteria to spread into her urethra and cause an infection.
+-
How Do I Get Tested for a UTI?
A health care provider can do a test to see if you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). Your provider will test a sample of your urine.
There are also home tests available at your local drugstore. Home tests contain specially treated plastic strips that you hold in a sample of your urine. If the end of the strip changes color, you may have a urinary tract infection. If the test shows you may have a UTI, see a health care provider right away — you will need treatment.
If you have UTI symptoms and a home test does not indicate an infection, you should still see a health care provider right away. You may actually have a UTI, or you may have another infection that needs treatment.
+-
Is There a Treatment for UTIs?
Yes. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is easy to treat. Treatments for urinary tract infections include
antibiotics — These drugs get rid of the infection.
over-the-counter pain relievers such as Uristat — These drugs may relieve painful symptoms but will not cure the UTI.
Make sure you take all of the antibiotics that were prescribed — even if you don't feel any more symptoms.
+-
Where Can I Get a Test or Treatment for a UTI?
Your local Planned Parenthood health center, many other clinics, and private health care providers offer tests and treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Think you may have a UTI?Find a health center
+-
Can I Prevent UTIs?
If you've ever had a urinary tract infection (UTI), you know that once is more than enough. The good news is you may be able to prevent UTIs. Try these simple tips to prevent getting a urinary tract infection:
Drink when you are thirsty.
Urinate as soon as you feel the urge. Don't hold it.
Keep your vulva clean and dry.
Drink unsweetened cranberry juice or take cranberry supplements. Cranberries contain an acid that helps prevent bacteria from growing.
Urinate immediately before and after sex play.
Avoid positions during sex that seem to trigger UTIs.
Use latex or female condoms during vaginal intercourse.
If you are susceptible to frequent UTIs, you may want to talk to your health care provider to see if there are any other reasons for the infections. Your provider may be able to provide antibiotics to help prevent a recurring infection.

D-Mannose Makes E Coli Happy
Like most organic compounds ending with “ose,” d-mannose is a form of sugar. This sugar is a bit different from others, however, in that it never enters the intestinal tract for the body to break down the sugar. Once the sugar reaches the stomach, it enters the bloodstream. The kidneys then will filter the d-mannose from the body.
One benefit of d-mannose for good urinary tract health is that it forms an interesting molecular compound that E Coli bacteria really like. These bacteria, which are the cause of the majority of urinary tract infections, cling to the d-mannose rather than to the bladder wall. The bacteria and sugar compound then leaves the body with the rest of your waste, helping to prevent a urinary tract infection.
D-mannose is available naturally in foods such as cranberries. D-mannose also comes in pill or powder form for people who need an extra boost of this sugar.

St. David's HealthCare is one of the largest health systems in Texas and Austin's
third-largest private employer, with more than 60 sites throughout Central Texas,

Urinary Tract Infection(UTI; Lower UTI)
by
Julie Riley, MS, RDEn Español (Spanish Version)More InDepth Information on This ConditionUTIs are caused by bacteria. The bacteria invade the urinary system and multiply. The infection can occur in any part of the urinary system, but usually starts in the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries the urine out of the body.The Urinary Tract© 2011 Nucleus Medical Media, Inc.Causes
In most cases, bacteria begins growing in the urethra. The bacteria comes most often from the digestive tract and rectal area. They cling to the opening of the urethra and begin to multiply. An infection only in the urethra is called
urethritis. From there, bacteria move to the bladder, causing a
bladder infection. If the infection is not treated right away, bacteria may then go up the ureters. Ureters are two tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. From there the infection can continue into the kidneys (
pyelonephritis).
Most infections are caused by one type of bacteria called
E. coli.
E. coli
normally lives in the colon. In women, since the rectum and urethra are fairly close to each other, the bacteria can move into the urethra. This makes women more prone to UTIs than men.
UTIs can also be sexually transmitted. This type of infection usually does not spread past the urethra. Both partners need to be treated.Risk Factors
These factors increase your chance of developing a UTI. Tell your doctor if you have any of these risk factors:
Sex: femaleBeing sexually active
Using a
diaphragm
for birth control
MenopauseDiabetesKidney stonesEnlarged prostateWeak immune system
Abnormalities of the urinary system, such as
vesicoureteral reflux,
polycystic kidneysParaplegia
or quadriplegia
Sickle-cell anemia
History of
kidney transplantBladder catheter
in place, or recent device inserted into the urinary system
PregnancySymptoms
If you have any of these symptoms do not assume they are due to a UTI. These symptoms may be caused by other conditions. Tell your doctor if you have any of these:
Frequent and urgent need to urinatePassing small amounts of urinePain in the abdomen or pelvic areaBurning sensation during urinationCloudy, bad-smelling urineIncreased need to get up at night to urinateBlood in the urineLeaking urineLow back pain or pain along the side of the ribsFever and chillsNausea and poor appetite
Bloody urine, low back pain, high fever, and chills are all signs of a
kidney infection. Call your doctor right away if you have these symptoms.
DiagnosisThe doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. A physical exam will also be done.
A sample of your urine will also be tested
for blood, pus, and bacteria.Children and men who have UTIs may need more testing. There may be structural problems of the kidneys, bladder, or tubes that make them likely to have an infection.TreatmentUTIs are treated with antibiotic drugs. Standard medical care for a UTI includes taking antibiotics for three days. You most likely will start to feel better after a day or two. However, it is important that you continue to take the entire course of medication.You may be asked to have your urine checked after you finish taking the antibiotics. This is to make sure that the infection is truly gone.If you still experience recurrent infections, you may be referred to a specialist.Pyridium
is a medicine that decreases pain and bladder spasm. It may turn your urine, and sometimes your sweat, an orange color.
In some cases, severe UTIs are treated with intravenous or intramuscular antibiotics. Researchers, though, found that oral antibiotics appear to be as effective in treating UTIs as other treatments.Prevention
Here are some steps you can take to keep bacteria out of your urinary tract:
Drink plenty of liquids, especially water.Include cranberry juice in your diet. Some studies support the use of cranberry juice to prevent UTIs.Urinate when you feel the need and do not resist the urge.Empty your bladder completely and drink a full glass of water after having sex.Wash genitals daily.If you are a woman, always wipe from the front to the back after having a bowel movement.Avoid using douches and feminine hygiene sprays.RESOURCES:American Urological Association Foundationhttp://www.urologyhealth.org/National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghousehttp://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/CANADIAN RESOURCES:Canadian Urological Associationhttp://www.cua.org/Women's Health Mattershttp://www.womenshealthmatters.ca/References:

Urinary Incontinence
What You Need To KnowMost women will experience a few UTIs over their lifetime. The ""honeymoon cystitis"" our mothers were told about speaks to one of the primary causes of UTIs—the milking action of sexual activity, which can cause bacteria from the vaginal or anal area to get into the bladder and urethra. Neglecting treatment of a UTI can be dangerous because the infection can ascend into the kidneys. If you think you may have a UTI, have a urine culture taken. If it is positive for bacteria, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic that will usually cure the problem without further treatment. Recurrent bladder infections, however, require a different approach. Chronic use of antibiotics to treat recurrent UTIs doesn’t address the underlying imbalance in the body that is leading to the infections. Antibiotics can also kill off helpful vaginal ﬂora, resulting in yeast infections, diarrhea, and—unfortunately—recurrent urinary tract infection.
Listen To Your BodyThe symptoms of urinary tract infections include burning on urination, blood in the urine, and fever.
What Causes This Women with episodic urinary symptoms often find that the episodes are accompanied by anger or feeling ""pissed off."" Developing a urinary tract infection may be the body’s way of releasing anger. Pay attention to what happened in your life and relationships 24 to 48 hours before the onset of the symptoms. When the anger becomes more chronic and less available on a conscious level, the symptoms may take the form of continual urinary urgency and frequency. Studies have shown that women with chronic bladder infections have more free-ﬂoating anxiety and more obsessive personality traits and tend to experience emotions only through their bodily symptoms (somatoform disorder) compared to women without this problem. Several researchers have found that women who feel the need to urinate frequently but who don’t have infections are more anxious and neurotic than those without the problem. Similarly, women who are anxious also experience urinary urgency (feeling as if you can’t make it to the bathroom in time), needing to get up at night to urinate, and frequent urination.
Healing Alternatives Get a medical evaluation to be sure that you don’t have some anatomical problem that is contributing to your infections. Make sure that the outer third of your urethra is well estrogenized. Your doctor should be able to evaluate this during a pelvic exam, because the urethra runs right under the top part of the vagina and is easily felt and observed. If there is any evidence of thinning of the outer urethra, which is common in menopausal and perimenopausal women, get a prescription for estrogen cream and use it in the upper part of the vagina, right along the urethral ridge. I recommend estriol 0.5 mg vaginal cream. The usual dose is 1 gram (one-quarter teaspoon) once daily for one week, then twice or three times per week or as needed thereafter. Other forms of vaginal estrogen also work well, including Estrace and Vagifem. The small amount needed to re-estrogenize the urethra does not raise levels in the blood signiﬁcantly and is considered safe.1
Spiritual and Holistic OptionsStop all caffeine, even decaf, for two weeks because caffeine is a bladder irritant. Reintroduce to see if symptoms recur. Drink lots of water or unsweetened (or artificially sweetened) cranberry juice the minute you feel any bladder symptoms. The extra liquid helps flush out bacteria, and cranberry juice also acidiﬁes the urine, making it harder for bacteria to grow. Drink 16 oz. per day to treat an infection, or 8 oz. per day to prevent infections. Try cranberry capsules available at natural food stores. Cranberries contain a substance that prevents bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall, thus decreasing the risk for recurrent infection. Take a probiotic regularly to help recolonize your gut with ""friendly"" bacteria. Because the anus and urethra are so close anatomically, encouraging the growth of favorable bacteria in one area of the body also helps the other. My favorite probiotic is PB 8, which unlike most other probiotics doesn’t have to be refrigerated. Another way to help restore your vaginal ﬂora if you’ve had repeated UTIs and multiple courses of antibiotics is to dip a stiff tampon (such as OB) in plain organic yogurt and put it in your vagina. Change ""yogurt tampons"" every three or four hours. You can also douche with yogurt or put a probiotic capsule directly in your vagina each night for a few nights. Acupuncture and Chinese herbs work very well for recurrent UTIs. The herb uva ursi contains a natural antibiotic that relieves bladder infection. The powdered solid extract (20 percent arbutin) comes in capsules; take two three times per day. You can also take the tincture—one dropperful in a cup of water three times per day. Vitamin C helps prevent reinfection. Take 1,000 to 2,000 mg every day, and if your infections are associated with sexual activity, take 1,000 mg before and 1,000 mg after sex. Drink plenty of ﬂuids, and be sure to urinate within one hour of having sex. UTIs are often associated with frequent or traumatic sex (sex that involves injury to the vaginal and vulvar tissues). Treatment involves making the necessary adjustments in your sex life to decrease trauma. This may mean using a lubricant if you suffer from vaginal dryness. It may also mean rethinking any aspects of the relationship that are less than satisfactory. Repeated bouts of infection and/or burning on urination can also be related to a woman’s contraceptive method. If your diaphragm is too large, it can irritate your urethra during intercourse, causing bacteria to enter the urethral opening and migrate up to the bladder area. Also, the use of condoms or contraceptive creams that contain the spermicide nonoxynol-9 can cause urethral irritation and burning on urination. It will go away when you stop using the offending agent. Don’t introduce bacteria into your urethral area. After using the toilet, make sure you wipe yourself from front to back, not the other way around. Castor oil packs applied to your lower abdomen two or three times a week can work wonders in preventing UTIs because they appear to improve immune system functioning.

Urinary tract infections have different names, depending on what part of the urinary tract is infected. Bladder -- an infection in the bladder is also called cystitis or a bladder infection Kidneys -- an infection of one or both kidneys is called pyelonephritis or a kidney infection Ureters -- the tubes that take urine from each kidney to the bladder are only rarely the site of infection Urethra -- an infection of the tube that empties urine from the bladder to the outside is called urethritisSee also: Cystitis - noninfectious Interstitial cystitis Urethritis Urinary tract infection - childrenAlternative NamesBladder infection - adults; UTI - adults; Cystitis - bacterial - adults; Pyelonephritis - adults; Kidney infection - adults Causes, incidence, and risk factorsUrinary tract infections are caused by germs, usually bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. This can lead to infection, most commonly in the bladder itself, which can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk of having UTIs. Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk of a UTI. The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI: Diabetes Advanced age (especially people in nursing homes) Problems emptying your bladder completely (urinary retention) A tube called a urinary catheter inserted into your urinary tract Bowel incontinence Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine Kidney stones Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture) Pregnancy Surgery or other procedure involving the urinary tractSymptomsThe symptoms of a bladder infection include: Cloudy or bloody urine, which may have a foul or strong odor Low fever (not everyone will have a fever) Pain or burning with urination Pressure or cramping in the lower abdomen (usually middle) or back Strong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptiedIf the infection spreads to your kidneys, symptoms may include: Chills and shaking or night sweats Fatigue and a general ill feeling Fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit Flank (side), back, or groin pain Flushed, warm, or reddened skin Mental changes or confusion (in the elderly, these symptoms often are the only signs of a UTI) Nausea and vomiting Severe abdominal pain (sometimes)Signs and testsA urine sample is usually collected to perform the following tests: Urinalysis is done to look for white blood cells, red blood cells, bacteria, and to test for certain chemicals, such as nitrites in the urine. Most of the time, your doctor or nurse can diagnose an infection using a urinalysis. Urine culture - clean catch may be done to identify the bacteria in the urine to make sure the correct antibiotic is being used for treatment.CBC and a blood culture may be done. The following tests may be done to help rule out problems in your urinary system that might lead to infection or make a UTI harder to treat: CT scan of the abdomen Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) Kidney scan Kidney ultrasound Voiding cystourethrogramTreatmentYour doctor must first decide whether you have a mild or simple bladder or kidney infection, or whether your infection is more serious. MILD BLADDER AND KIDNEY INFECTIONS Antibiotics taken by mouth are usually recommended because there is a risk that the infection can spread to the kidneys. For a simple bladder infection, you will take antibiotics for 3 days (women) or 7 - 14 days (men). For a bladder infection with complications such as pregnancy or diabetes, OR a mild kidney infection, you will usually take antibiotics for 7 - 14 days. It is important that you finish all the antibiotics, even if you feel better. If you do not finish all your antibiotics, the infection could return and may be harder to treat.Commonly used antibiotics include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, Augmentin, doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones. Your doctor will also want to know whether you could be pregnant. Your doctor may also recommend drugs to relieve the burning pain and urgent need to urinate. Phenazopyridine hydrochloride (Pyridium) is the most common of this type of drug. You will still need to take antibiotics. Everyone with a bladder or kidney infection should drink plenty of fluids. Some women have repeat or recurrent bladder infections. Your doctor may suggest several different ways of treating these. Taking a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual contact may prevent these infections, which occur after sexual activity. Having a 3-day course of antibiotics at home to use for infections diagnosed based on your symptoms may work for some women. Some women may also try taking a single, daily dose of an antibiotic to prevent infections.See also: Catheter-associated UTI MORE SEVERE KIDNEY INFECTIONS If you are very sick and cannot take medicines by mouth or drink enough fluids, you may be admitted to the hospital. You may also be admitted to the hospital if you: Are elderly Have kidney stones or changes in the anatomy of your urinary tract Have recently had urinary tract surgery Have cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or other medical problems Are pregnant and have a fever or are otherwise illAt the hospital, you will receive fluids and antibiotics through a vein. Some people have urinary tract infections that keep coming back or that do not go away with treatment. Such infections are called chronic UTIs. If you have a chronic UTI, you may need antibiotics for many months, or stronger antibiotics may be prescribed. If a structural (anatomical) problem is causing the infection, surgery may be recommended. Expectations (prognosis)A urinary tract infection is uncomfortable, but treatment is usually successful. Symptoms of a bladder infection usually disappear within 24 - 48 hours after treatment begins. If you have a kidney infection, it may take 1 week or longer for your symptoms to go away. ComplicationsLife-threatening blood infection (sepsis) - risk is greater among the young, very old adults, and those whose bodies cannot fight infections (for example, due to HIV or cancer chemotherapy) Kidney damage or scarring Kidney infectionCalling your health care providerContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call right away if the following symptoms develop: Back or side pain Chills Fever VomitingThese may be signs of a possible kidney infection. Also call if you have already been diagnosed with a UTI and the symptoms come back shortly after treatment with antibiotics. PreventionLifestyle changes may help prevent some UTIs. After menopause, a woman may use estrogen cream in the vagina area to reduce the chance of further infections. BATHING AND HYGIENE Choose sanitary pads instead of tampons, which some doctors believe make infections more likely. Change the pad each time you use the bathroom. Do not douche or use feminine hygiene sprays or powders. As a general rule, do not use any product containing perfumes in the genital area. Take showers instead of baths. Avoid bath oils. Keep your genital area clean. Clean your genital and anal areas before and after sexual activity. Urinate before and after sexual activity. Wipe from front to back after using the bathroom.CLOTHING Avoid tight-fitting pants. Wear cotton-cloth underwear and pantyhose, and change both at least once a day.DIET Drink plenty of fluids (2 to 4 quarts each day). Drink cranberry juice or use cranberry tablets, but NOT if you have a personal or family history of kidney stones. Do NOT drink fluids that irritate the bladder, such as alcohol and caffeine.ReferencesLin K, Fajardo K; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Ear acupuncture in the treatment of migraine attacks: a randomized trial on the efficacy of appropriate versus inappropriate acupoints.

Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Women's Headache Center, University of Turin, Via Ventimiglia 3, 10126 Turin, Italy. gb.allais@tiscali.it
Ear acupuncture can be a useful mean for controlling migraine pain. It has been shown that a technique called the Needle Contact Test (NCT) can identify the most efficacious ear acupoints for reducing current migraine pain through just a few seconds of needle contact. The majority of the points were located on the antero-internal part of the antitragus (area M) on the same side of pain. The aim of this study was to verify the therapeutic value of area M and to compare it with an area of the ear (representation of the sciatic nerve, area S) which probably does not have a therapeutic effect on migraine attacks. We studied 94 females suffering from migraine without aura, diagnosed according to the ICHD-II criteria, during the attack. They were randomly subdivided into two groups: in group A, tender points located in area M, positive to NCT were inserted; in group B, the unsuitable area (S) was treated. Changes in pain intensity were measured using a VAS scale at various times of the study. During treatment, there was a highly significant trend in the reduction of the VAS value in group A (Anova for repeated measures: p < 0.001), whereas no significance was observed in group B. VAS values were significantly lower in group A than in group B at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after needle insertion. This study suggests that the therapeutic specificity of auricular points exists and is linked to the somatotopic representation of our body on the ear.

Some End-Of-The-Week Stupidity
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
As far as I know the mortality rate due to ghosts is zero. There are no credibly documented cases of anyone being injured or killed by a ghost. Besides – they are supposed to be immaterial, so how could they harm you? They might make you a bit chilly, or give you a severe case of the willies, but that’s it. I suppose they could frighten a weak-hearted person to death, in which case all we have to fear is fear itself.
So why, then, are people so terrified of ghosts. I admit I have never seen one, so I cannot honestly brag about how I would react, but I think I would be more fascinated than anything else. My primary thought would probably be – where’s my camera?
Why, then, are staff at Derby’s new Royal Hospital so frightened? According to news reports:
There have been dozens of sightings over recent weeks and people are scared witless.

Dinosaur Fossils and Evolution
Published by Steven Novella under Evolution
Leading up to the 200th anniversary of Darwin’s birth on February 12th, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of the Origin of Species, I will be covering more evolution-related news items. It has long been a favorite scientific topic of mine anyway, so it’s a good enough excuse to focus on evolution.
One of the strongest lines of evidence for the fact that life on earth arose through evolution is the fossil record. I do not think this is the strongest line of evidence, not because it is weak but because the genetic evidence is so remarkably strong. Statistically speaking, the genetic evidence speaks to common descent through branching speciation of all life on earth to such a degree that it approaches certainty.
But the fossil evidence is also impressive, and much more visceral – walking into a museum full of gigantic fossil dinosaurs (or at least their casts) has a coolness factor with which a string of base pairs cannot compete.
Creationists, of course, deny the implications of the fossil evidence. At the extreme end are some young-earth creationists who claim that Satan put the fossils there to test our faith. That unfalsifiable notion is not worth further comment.

Obama’s UFO
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
The interwebbies is full of discussion about the alleged UFO that was filmed by CNN just prior to Obama’s inauguration. You can watch the video here, along with some amusing commentary by a UFO believer.
edit: The Youtube video was removed, so watch this version here.
When I first saw the video my immediate reaction was that this blurry object that flies across the screen was a bird, or perhaps an insect closer to the camera. After looking more closely, and hearing various commentary, I am convinced that these are the most likely explanations – and of the two I think it is most likely a bird.Watch the video carefully. Despite the narrators description that the object moves in a straight line, it is not moving in a straight line at all. It is moving in a sinusoidal wave, which means it is bobbing up and down slightly as it flies. This is exactly how a flapping bird moves through the air (and why I think it’s a bird and not an insect).In fact the narrator mentions that it looks as if some flapping is visible, but he dismisses this as an artifact of the camera. I disagree – I think we are seeing the blurry flapping of wings.

Yet More Evidence Against a Link Between Thimerosal and Autism
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
A new study published yesterday (Monday) in the journal Pediatrics provides more evidence against any link between thimerosal (a mercury-based preservative in some vaccines) and autism or other neurological disorders. This study adds to the large and growing body of scientific evidence for the safety of vaccines, and contradicting the claims of the anti-vaccine movement that vaccines cause autism.
The study is a bit fortuitous in that it was not originally designed to probe this question. Rather, this was a safety and efficacy study of the acellular pertussis vaccine conducted in Italy between 1992 and 1993. But it created a cohort of children who were carefully screened and monitored, and randomized to different exposures to thimerosal. This allowed the researchers to go back 10 years later to survey and examine the children for neurological disorders.

An fMRI Wrinkle
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is an extremely useful new technology (created in 1993 and increasingly used over the last decade) to study brain activity. Like any new and complex tool, however, it is critical to understand how the tool works, especially when interpreting research. A new study published today in Nature may cause fMRI researchers to change how they conduct an interpret their research.
fMRI is an application of regular MRI, made possible by advances in computer processing power and researchers finding new ways to exploit how living tissue responds to a powerful magnetic field. In the case of fMRI it was discovered that blood reacts differently when it is highly oxygenated than when it is less oxygenated. This is because oxyhemoglobin (the form of hemoglobin with oxygen) is diamagnetic, while deoxyhemoglobin (the form of hemoglobin without oxygen) is paramagnetic. Most living tissue (and in fact most stuff) is diamagnetic – in response to a strong external magnetic field it creates a weak opposite magnetic field. In superconductors this property can be exploited to create levitation above a strong magnet. A paramagnetic substance, rather, in response to a strong external magnetic field creates an attractive magnetic field. Unlike ferromagnetic materials (like iron), diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances lose their magnetic field as soon as the external field ends – they are not permanent or long-lasting.
All of this means that oxygenated and less oxygenated blood behave differently in the magnetic field of an MRI and this differential response can be exploited to image relative arterial blood flow to different parts of the brain. An entire branch of neuroscientific research has sprung up over this fact – using fMRI to see which parts of the brain are active when subjects are asked to perform a specific task, when they are exposed to external stimuli, or in different disease states.

Some Follow Up On Migraines
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
Yesterday I wrote about a new Cochrane review of acupuncture and migraines. The most significant result of the review was that published studies show no difference between “real” acupuncture and “sham” acupuncture. This is the part of trials that can be blinded – well, single-blinded at least (the subject does not know which is real vs sham, but the acupuncturist does). This blinded data is negative, indicating that it does not matter where you stick the needles, which is a strong indication that the underlying philosophy of acupuncture is false. Further, now that acupuncture studies are being done with placebo acupuncture – opaque sheaths and dull needles that do not penetrate the skin, allowing for double-blind studies – these are also coming out negative.
Therefore, I think it is reasonable to conclude from the literature that it does not matter where you stick acupuncture needles, or even if you stick them. Therefore, any observed benefit must be either: 1) an artifact of the study design (i.e. placebo effects); or 2) a result of other things that are happening in association with the acupuncture treatment.
Several points were raised in the comments I want to address in some detail. Further, there are many questions about migraines, and since migraines make up a significant portion of my clinical practice I can clear up some of the confusion as well.
Migraines
First some background on migraines. Migraines are a specific kind of primary headache, meaning that the headache is the disorder and is not secondary to an underlying problem, like a brain tumor. Migraine are variable in their presentation, and so are defined as having some of a list of symptoms. These include unilateral (one-sided), throbbing, can be triggered by various things, and associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, and strong odors. Migraines can also occur with an aura, which is a neurological symptom occuring before or during the headache, most commonly visual changes like dark spots (scotoma) or flashing lights (visual fortifications).

Through the CAM Looking Glass
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
A newly published systematic review of a controversial anti-migraine drug, migrostat, shows that it works no better than placebo. The review for the Cochrane Collaboration looked at 33 trials, involving a total of 6,736 patients. Those patients treated with migrostat had a reduction of frequency and severity of migraines of about 30%, but this was no better than the placebo group which experienced a similar reduction (there was a “slight” advantage for tension headaches, likely noise in the randomness) – a response rate typical of placebo treatment for subjective symptoms.
The lead author of the review, Dr. Jacob Bayous, who works for the Pharmaceutical Industry Research Center, is quoted as saying:
“Much of the clinical benefit of migrostat might be due to non-specific effects and powerful placebo effects, meaning selection of specific chemical constituents may be less important than industry proponents have traditionally argued.”
Despite the fact that this review clearly shows that migrostat is no better than placebo – the standard scientific interpretation of which is that it does not work – industry proponents (who are eager to get FDA approval for migrostat) claim that the drug works – “as placebo.” They argue that migraine sufferers still find relief from taking migrostat, and that relief is valuable, even if it is only an effect of the “power of the mind.”

Stem Cells for Stroke
Published by Steven Novella under Uncategorized
Dr. Keith Muir is leading a trial at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow that is about to test stem cells as a possible therapy in stroke. As reported by the BBC, the trial is set to enroll 12 subjects and will last for two years. While this will be far from a definitive trial, it will explore the basic safety and potential of this approach.
Strokes occur due to lack of blood flow to a part of the brain. Those brain cells are injured – those at the core of the stroke die while those around the periphery (which is usually much larger in volume than the core), which are getting some blood flow, may or may not survive. About a third of stroke patients recover either fully or nearly so, while the rest either die or suffer permanent neurological deficits. The symptoms of a stroke depend upon what part of the brain is damaged.
Dead brain cells do not come back. Initial recovery results from damaged but not dead neurons recovering their function. After that, deficits are due to dead brain cells and are considered permanent. However, further recovery is possible (although slow – months to years) due to the brain’s plasticity. The brain can rewire around damaged section, and form new pathways. In addition, healthy cortex can take over the lost functions or compensate for them to some degree. This takes a great deal of time and effort, which is part of the function of the long course of rehabilitation that often takes place following a stroke.

Louisiana, We Have a Problem
Published by Steven Novella under Evolution
In my recent post on the battle between science and creationism, I noted that the current strategy of the intelligent design (ID)/creationism movement is to push for academic freedom. They don’t really care about academic freedom, they just want to erode academic quality standards so as create a back door through which they can squeeze their religious beliefs into science classrooms. This strategy is playing out in Louisiana.
Last year Louisiana governor Bobby Jindahl signed into law an academic freedom bill that was part of this strategy. Now, just last week, the state’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education passed the Louisiana Science Education Ac. Casey Luskin, one of the worst apologists for anti-science over at the ID “think tank”, the Discovery Institute, characterized this bill as a “victory for Louisiana students and teachers.” If Luskin in happy with this bill, we should be very worried.

FTC Sues 5 Online Companies for Peddling False Cancer Treatments
By bmartin on September 22, 2008 12:05 PM
| Permalink
The Federal Trade Commission has sued 5 companies, alleging their deceptive advertising of bogus cancer cures, according to a government press release on Thursday. The suits are the culmination of an extended investigation,* in concert with the US FDA and the Competition Bureau Canada, to crack down on the online sale of unproven and potentially harmful products that are intended for the prevention, treatment, and/or cure of cancer. (See here for additional background.)
The 5 defendant companies (and associated individuals) are the following.
Alexander Heckman doing business as (d/b/a) Omega Supply and Eric Del Rio (San Diego, CA) through the website laetrilesupply.com: In addition to bogusly marketing cyanide-containing laetrile (aka ""amygdalin"" aka ""vitamin B17"") as a cancer cure, Heckman and Del Rio are charged with making false claims regarding the benefits of hydrazine sulphate (a potential carcinogen) and cloracesium (aka cesium chloride).
Mark J. and Marianne Hershiser d/b/a Native Essence Herb Company (El Prado, NM) through various websites: The FTC cites the company's marketing of the chaparral shrub (associated with ""acute toxic hepatitis"" per the FDA), various herbal concoctions, and maitake mushroom extracts.
James Feijo d/b/a Daniel Chapter One (Portsmith, RI) through the website danielchapterone.com: The company sells shark cartilage and herbal formulations. According to the FTC, Feijo claims that one of his formulations mitigates the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy.
William H. Iseley, owner of Gemtronics, Inc (Franklin, NC): Iseley's company markets Chrysobalanus icaco (aka the Florida evergreen shrub cocoplum) and Agaricus, the most widely consumed genus of mushroom.
Mary T. Spohn d/b/a Herbs for Cancer (Surprise, AZ): Spohn markets a whole slew of Chinese herbal teas, according to the FTC's complaint, which are advertised to treat at least 16 types of cancer.
The 5 suits will be litigated before administrative law judges at the FTC. The FTC also reports complaints against 6 other companies that have been settled. The proposed settlements stipulate that the cited individuals and/or companies will pay sizable judgments (in some cases, several hundred thousand dollars) and will be barred from representing their products as preventing, treating, or curing cancer without the support of ""reliable scientific evidence."" The settlements, however, do not constitute an admission of guilt by the defendants.
* Between August 2007 and January 2008, the FTC sent warning letters via e-mail to 112 websites. Among these, nearly 30% closed their sites or removed cancer-treatment claims.

nitrilosides. Reprinted with permission from www.worldwithoutcancer.comCharles Gurchot, Ph.D.Oral doses of Vitamin B-17 seem not to much affected by the action of the acid medium of the stomach, but pass into the intestine where the substance is acted upon by bacterial enzymes.In the intestine the enzyme complex Emulsin containing the enzymes Beta-glucosidase, Benzocyanase, and others, degrades the Amygdalin into four components: Hydrocyanic acid, Benzaldehyde, Prunasin, and Mandelonitrile, which are absorbed into the lymph and portal circulations.Cyanide is converted to thiocyanate probably in the blood circulation, and certainly in the liver by the enzyme rhodanese in the presence of sulfur-bearing compounds.1,2 The circulating thiocyanate exerts certain physiological effects on blood pressure and thyroid action, and is not excreted rapidly. (In the absence of the enzyme or sulfur, the cyanide may form cyano-hemoglobin.)In cancer patients some thiocyanate finds its way to the site of the cancer lesion.The benzaldehyde formed in the intestine probably has no important function, but in the circulation forms benzoic acid and is excreted as benzaldehyde hippurate.Prunasin (the mono-glucoside of Mandelonitrile) can circulate in the body and reach the malignant lesion, and as such hydrolyse to liberate hydrocyanic acid, benzaldehyde, and one glucose molecule.Prunasin may also be changed in the liver to Mandelonitrile glucuronoside. This conversion to the glucuoronoside may take place in two different ways: 1) by combining with glucuronic acid, which would remove one sugar molecule; 2) by oxidation of the terminal alcohol group of the prunasin glucose molecule.The mandelonitrile is absorbed from the intestine, going directly to the liver where it is converted by the detoxification mechanism of joining it to glucuronic acid. It may then be excreted as the glucuronide or find its way to the site of a malignant lesion.Glucosidic enzymes at the lesion may hydrolyse prunasin into its components cyanide, benzaldehyde, and a glucose molecule, to interfere with tissue respiration. In the process of enzyme hydrolysis pure mandelonitrile, as an intermediate step, may be released.Mandelonitrile of itself may undergo spontaneous hydrolysis to HCN and benzaldehyde or enzymatic decomposition by benzocyanase present in the emulsin complex.Mandelonitrile glucuronide may be hydrolysed at the tumor site by Beta-glucuronidase to yield HCN, benzaldehyde and glucuronic acid.Benzaldehyde released through these processes at the site of the malignant lesion may be reduced to benzyl alcohol, and combine with the thiocyanate to form benzo thiocyanate. This compound is further reduced to a thio-alcohol, benzo mercaptain, and hydrocyanic acid. In this manner HCN reappears and may continue to do so in a cyclic manner until the intracellular conditions that permit the reaction involved in the cycle are no longer operative.These phenomena would explain the synergistic effect of benzaldehyde and cyanide in depressing the metabolism of mouse tumor slices in the Warburg apparatus (Dean Burk3).In the absense of rhodanese the cyanide probably exerts its lethal effects on cell respiration, which is relatively small in cancer cells, by interferance with the cytochrome oxidase enzymes.Cyanide, either as such, or as mandelonitrile, may combine with glucose to form cyanoglucose, which, on hydrolysis, forms a glucuronide heptose analogous to gluconic acid, which would be excreted, or dehydrogenated to heptose, which also would be excreted. The conditions for this transformation exist in cancer tissue and would constitute anti-gluconeogenesis.[From Physicians Handbook of Vitamin B-17 Therapy, McNaughton Foundation, Published by: Science Press International, 1973]References: Sorbo, Acta Chem.Scand. 5,1951,(724-34);1953 (1129-1136);1953 (1137-1145).

The Budwig Diet
Posted on February 7, 2012 by Laura
After just a few weeks of intravenous vitamin C injections, Ozone therapy and manic supplement buying, Mum’s credit card had taken a battering.
While Mum has been lucky enough to be able to afford these things, for many people alternative cancer treatments can be financially crippling. Why? Unlike radiotherapy and chemotherapy they are seldom covered by health insurance.
So I’m happy this week to talk about a therapy that’s cheap, simple and which has paved the recovery for thousands of cancer patients.
No appointments or airfares required for this one, all you need to start the Budwig Diet is a tub of cottage cheese and a bottle of flaxseed oil.
Bill Henderson, a cancer coach who has helped over 8000 cancer patients reverse the disease, calls the Budwig protocol, ‘the cheapest health insurance you can buy.’
Bill became interested in alternative cancer treatments following his late wife Marjorie’s four-year battle with ovarian cancer. Bill maintains that Marjorie’s death was not the result of the cancer itself, but rather the endless rounds of chemotherapy she endured.
After witnessing the pain she suffered, Bill embarked on more than a decade of research into alternative therapies and eventually stumbled upon the Budwig Diet which is now the backbone of his anti-cancer programme.
So how does it work?
‘Basically, the Budwig protocol blasts the cancer cells with oxygen,’ writes Bill in his best-selling book Cancer Free. ‘…[C]ancer cells react to oxygenation the way a vampire would react to broad daylight: they shrivel up and die.’
The Facts on Flax
Flaxseed oil is packed with omega 3 fatty acids, a group of nutrients that most of us have heard of by now.
While the brain-boosting and anti-inflammatory properties of omega 3 have received a great deal of coverage in recent years, the role this vital nutrient plays in oxygenating our system is perhaps less well known.
‘Omega 3 works like a magnet on the cell membrane, attracting oxygen to the cell and also causing the oxygen to enter the cell,’ explains Bill Henderson in Cancer Free.
Since flaxseed oil can oxygenate the blood, you might then wonder why the cottage cheese is required? The answer is simple.
When you blend cottage cheese with flaxseed oil, the mixture becomes water-soluble and thanks to this water solubility the omega-3 fatty acids are effectively delivered to the cells.
But Aren’t Dairy Products Bad?
Yes – according to many experts, including Professor Jane Plant – dairy products can drive hormonal cancers. But Bill maintains that when you mix cottage cheese with flaxseed oil it ‘loses its dairy properties.’
Where ‘ Budwig’ Began
In the 1950s Dr Johanna Budwig, one of Germany’s leading biochemists – and seven time Nobel prize nominee – discovered the right combination of essential fatty acids (found in flaxseed oil) and sulphur-based proteins (present in cottage cheese) could kill off cancer cells.
After collecting and analyzing thousands of blood samples Dr Budwig discovered that the samples of the seriously ill (including cancer patients) were always deficient in one vital fatty acid – linoleic acid. She also found that the patients were often lacking albumin (a combination of linoleic acid and sulphur-based protein).
Dr Budwig hypothesized that those suffering from serious illnesses could be returned to health by eating a diet high in these essential nutrients.
Budwig tested her theory by feeding cancer patients a combination of 40 grams of flaxseed oil mixed with 100 grams of skim-milk proteins (the latest Budwig formula recommends low-fat cottage cheese in its place).
Over a period of weeks, she noticed the tumours gradually receded.
Since that time, thousands of people struggling with cancer– including those dealing with brain cancer and bone cancer – have become healthy again using this simple diet.
Dr. Budwig (who died in 2003 at the age of 95) claimed to have had over a 90% success rate with her diet and protocol with all kinds of cancer patients over a 50 -year period.
Dorothy McCord, who had liver cancer, ovarian cancer (with metastasis) and a low-grade brain tumour saw a dramatic shift in her condition after starting the Budwig Protocol.
I’ve included an excerpt from her testimonial on the Budwig Centre website below:
‘I went to have an ultrasound done on my ovaries the other day, to see if anything has changed with the cysts on my ovaries. When I went, they told me that there were no cysts left (mind you one of them was the size of a lemon). My ovaries were totally clean. Also I had a MRI on my liver again, and that was good news as well. The mass on my liver has shrank in 4 months from being 6 cm to 1.1 cm. I can’t tell you how ecstatic I am. I am almost in shock over the amount of good news I have received this week. For a while now, every time I went to the doctor, I only received bad news. I am so happy, and more determent (sic) to stay on the program as long as it takes.’
William L Fischer’s fantastic book How to Fight Cancer & Win is filled with stories from people who have benefitted from the Budwig protocol. One of the most remarkable reports is from Keith O*, a sixteen year old who faced amputation due to an osteosclerotic sarcoma (bone tumour). I have included an extract of his story below:
‘He [Keith] was immediately started on an intensive program of radiation treatments, but still no improvement was noted. This young high-school track star said he would rather face death than lose his leg. The situation appeared hopeless. Keith’s distraught parents consulted with the most eminent doctors they could locate in many areas, but all confirmed the frightening prognosis.
Only a meeting with Dr Johanna Budwig and her words of hope stopped the planned amputation in time. After just two weeks on the Budwig formula, Keith was able to completely extend his right leg…A medical examination conducted two months later revealed that the swelling of Keith’s involved leg had receded considerably and his blood count had returned to normal. Within just three months of starting on the regimen, he was back at school. The family reports that the Budwig formula remains a part of its daily diet. The entire family, including Keith, is in excellent health.’ How to Fight Cancer and Win ( pages 156-157)
the flax flower
Recent research supports Dr Budwig’s theory that flaxseed oil is like kryptonite to cancer cells. According to one Polish study the active elements in flaxseed oil kill cancer cells while bypassing healthy white blood cells.
Another recent French study found that low levels of alpha-linolenic acid (found abundantly in flaxseed oil) were a predictor of increased risk of breast cancer. The study was published in the February 2000 issue of the European Journal of Cancer.
Need to Know
Make sure the flaxseed oil you buy is cold-pressed, virgin, unrefined and raw. The valuable (anti-cancer) fats in flaxseed are removed during the refining process that most commercial oils undergo. This routine process can include heating, bleaching, deodorizing, ‘defoaming’ as well as the addition of chemical preservatives.
It’s also vital to refrigerate flaxseed oil and keep it away from sunlight since the oil oxidizes very rapidly.
Cottage Cheese
It must be low fat (less than 2%) and preferably organic.
The Mixture
The basic Budwig Diet consists of a daily dose of one or two tablespoon of flaxseed oil blended with half to one cup of low-fat cottage cheese. Seriously ill patients, including cancer patients, may need to consume higher quantities than this however I would strongly recommend that anyone considering this diet first consult a qualified practitioner and read all of the supporting literature on the subject.
The Blending Process
To produce the chemical reaction required for it to be a potent cancer fighter, the cottage cheese and flaxseed oil MUST be machine blended.
Mum uses a hand-held immersion blender (previously reserved for vodka spaghetti sauce) to ensure the oil permeates the cottage cheese completely.
She then adds a mixture of frozen berries and occasionally a teaspoon of stevia to sweeten her Budwig breakfast.
You can ‘bespoke’ your Budwig by adding fresh herbs, raw vegetables, fruits, cinnamon, raisins… the list is endless. Fisher suggests adding finely grated cucumbers and radishes with some chopped tomatoes and a crumbling of dill.
It’s important to blend the cottage cheese and flaxseed oil first – to ensure they’re properly homogenized – before adding the other ingredients.

Finally, I just wanted to say a huge thank you to all the people who got in touch following the piece that appeared in The Sunday Times Style Magazine in London. The emails were so uplilfting and I’m sorry that I haven’t yet had a chance to respond to all of you – being a one man band can make it tricky.

‘I also said no to chemo’
Posted on February 1, 2012 by Laura
While we often read stories from cancer survivors who have chosen the conventional route, those who have taken the natural path are so rarely given a voice.
But hearing from others who have taken the road less traveled and come out the other side can be just as important as any dietary change or treatment plan.
In the last few months I’ve received a steady stream of emails from people telling me about their own alternative cancer journeys. These stories have filled Mum and I with hope and joy and so we thought we’d share with you some of these uplifting tales.
Jessica Richards, 5-year breast cancer survivor
In May 2007, I was diagnosed with a 3.5cm Stage two invasive, ductal carcinoma (a large breast cancer), and was recommended a partial or full mastectomy and removal of lymph nodes, intensive chemo, radiotherapy and five years of drugs. Nearly five years on I’m extremely fit and well having had no medical treatment whatsoever.
I held off deciding on any particular treatment until I’d had a full diagnosis and seen the results of my tumour biopsy and lymph node biopsy. I then investigated each treatment I had been prescribed and the first thing I decided against was chemotherapy. I gradually became aware that what I was being offered was not necessarily my best option when weighed up against the risks from ‘side’ effects and the negligible benefits.
Ultimately my choice was a simple one:
A. If I’m going to live, could I face life with the long-term side effects of chemo and radiation, which would have impaired my health and wellbeing in the long term? The answer to that was, No.
B. If I’m going to die anyway, do I want to spend the last year or so of my life in and out of hospital wishing I were dead? The answer to that was again, No.
The alternative route seemed to offer me the best chance of recovery with no damaging side effects. I would like to make it very clear that I did not base any of my choices on belief. I simply made rational decisions based on the facts and evidence presented to me, in that I did everything I could to support my immune system (rather than destroy it) and at the same time, wreck the cancer environment within my body.
When family and friends eventually found out about my decision their reactions ranged from, ‘Wow you’re bold!’ to, ‘What!?!’
I would like to add here that I did everything under medical supervision. I have friends and colleagues in Harley Street where I’ve been based for 20 years and I found a very supportive consultant who agreed to monitor me. My book includes an interview with him and other members of my medical and health care team.
One of the most difficult aspects of choosing the alternative route was paying for all my treatments privately. I also had difficulty finding genuine clinics and practitioners from amongst the cranks and charlatans and those seeking to financially exploit cancer patients.
Many people assumed my situation wasn’t very serious because I didn’t lose my hair and wasn’t in and out of hospital. I found, as a result, that sometimes I wasn’t offered the same level of support as those taking the conventional route. It seems that many people think hair-loss, sickness and general illness are caused by cancer rather than the treatments they’ve endured.
I have little doubt that intravenous Vitamin C (which I had with Dr. Andre Young-Snell in Brighton) was the most vital treatment to my recovery. In fact, when I had ultra sound scans at the time, the radiologist said that the tumour was breaking down in exactly the same way that a tumour breaks down with chemo.
There’s no question in my mind that mental attitude is everything in cancer recovery and I have dedicated a chapter of my book to a step-by-step guide on how to develop the attitude to enable you to recover. It’s not what life presents to us which defines who we are but who we choose to be in relationship to it.
The one piece of advice I would offer anyone facing a receiving a cancer diagnosis is, unless you’ve been told it is a medical emergency, TAKE YOUR TIME. I believe this was the best decision I made at the beginning and, interestingly, this advice was echoed when I later interviewed my team members. When diagnosed with cancer, we are all in a serious situation but few are in an immediately urgent one. We need to get over the shock of the diagnosis before we can even begin to think about some of the very complex and critical decisions we have to make.

Jane Wallis, 6-year bladder cancer survivor
When I started getting up to go to the bathroom about four times every night, I knew that something was up and I decided to go for a check-up. The doctors initially thought I had a prolapse of the bladder, but a young trainee Chinese doctor working in the hospital knew it was more serious. She did a manual feel inside me and said she thought I had a tumour. But her diagnosis was dismissed: another doctor said to me she was ‘only a trainee’ and ‘didn’t know what she was talking about.’
Only when I started to hemorrhage lots of blood did the doctors agree that something was wrong, and after I had a camera inspection they found the cancer. It was rated T4- the most virulent type according to the specialists. They told me the only answer was to have my bladder and most probably my kidney removed as this had also stopped working due to the tumour’s location.
On the same day I received the news we called in to see our good friend Dave on the way home. Dave – who had been convinced that the chemo treatment killed his first wife and not the cancer – put some apricot kernels into my hand and said ‘here, these are what you need!’ How right he was.
My husband Nigel is a dowser and so we ‘asked’ if the apricot kernels and other dietary changes I’d researched were going to be good for me and the answer was ‘yes.’ I know many people believe that dowsing is all nonsense, but over the years I’ve found it incredibly helpful in many different areas.
I also began to take Essiac Tea, various vitamins and Chinese herbs and I started to follow The pH Miracle diet .
Within what seemed like a few days my symptoms improved. So when the hospital contacted me to schedule my operation I told the surgeon’s PA that I had decided against it and that I was going to treat the cancer myself.
I will always remember the total silence that followed, before she put the phone down. A few minutes later she rang again to ask what I was doing before telling me she hoped I realised my cancer was really bad. I assured her that I understood but this was my decision and that I would write to the surgeon to explain.
A few days later I got a call from my local doctor asking me to come in and see him.
He tried very hard to persuade me to have the surgery. As he was talking I glimpsed a copy of the letter I sent to the surgeon on his computer and saw that he had scrawled all over it with rude comments. One remark that I remember vividly was; ‘who does this bloody women think she is’. When the doctor realised I could see it he switched the computer off very quickly.
That was the last time I went in any doctor’s surgery – over six years ago. It only took eight months for my body to be 100% cured after starting to take the apricot kernels and I’ve been well since then.
My background in alternative healing no doubt informed the path I chose. I previously trained as a spiritual healer, and my teacher always said ‘cancer is the body’s suicide note, and it will carry it out unless the person changes’. She had noticed over many years that those who got better were the people who changed what was dysfunctional in their lives.
So this really helped to give me strength to change what I knew I must. I now see my cancer as a kind of ‘temporary changing room’; somewhere where I ‘changed’ by getting rid of all the people, situations and habits that I had to ‘take off’ and leave behind.
Certain books really helped me through this transformational process. Gregg Braden’s The Divine Matrix taught me that the world is not as it seems; that it’s jam-packed with the kind of miracles that the ‘white coats’ might tell you are impossible. Other eye opening books I read included Dirty Medicine by Martin Walker and Quantum Healing by Deepak Chopra.
It was inspiring authors like these who showed me that the real healing is possible but you need to know and trust, deep down, that you will get better.

Medical Intuitives
Posted on January 25, 2012 by Laura
‘Dis-aster’ means ‘from the stars,’ indicating a long-held belief that bad things happen for reasons known by the heavens.’ Caroline Myss, Sacred Contracts
Ten months on, Mum now sees her cancer diagnosis as a much-needed ‘wake-up’ call from a life she was, in some ways, sleep-walking through:
‘I was in a bit of a bad place,’ Mum says of her previous emotional state. ‘I’d wake up each morning thinking ‘ here we go again,’ finding little pleasure in my daily routine. Although I had been given a great life, in many ways I felt stuck and powerless to make any changes.’
Caroline Myss, America’s most revered medical intuitive, believes that our ‘biography becomes our biology’; that every thought affects our tissue and that toxic memories reside in our cellular structure.
When Mum first read Myss’ seminal work, Anatomy of the Spirit something clicked. She felt that her emotional state had, at least in part, contributed to her cancer and that turning her mindset around would be vital to her recovery.
She also knew the reverse was true; that getting her body moving again would boost feel-good endorphins and elevate her mood. So, about six weeks after her hysterectomy, Mum resumed her sessions with Bogna Forbes, her pilates teacher and trusted friend.
Mum was still feeling emotionally fragile and physically weak when she arrived at Bogna’s studio, but she put on a brave face and said breezily:
‘Hi Bogna, how are you?!’
Bogna tilted her head to the side and said: ‘So how are things going?’
‘Fine, all-good!’ Mum insisted.
‘I don’t think so!’ said Bogna in her no nonsense tone.
‘ Ok, you’re right,’ Mum said, before telling Bogna what was on her mind.
Bogna Forbes
In sensing Mum’s anxiety and fear and encouraging her to release it, Bogna could then work much more effectively on her body.
‘When we verbalize what’s going on in our head, blockages in the body disappear,’ Bogna explained, when I spoke to her recently.
These ‘blockages’ can often arise from unresolved emotions or experiences, according to Bogna.
‘For instance, if you’ve been hurt emotionally, the lining around the heart starts to tighten; you start to build an anatomical wall to stop you getting hurt again,’ said Bogna. ‘ So people who have been hurt will often start to hunch forward as if they are literally holding everything in.’
That’s not to say that everyone with a dowager’s hump has a broken heart – years spent squinting at a laptop will also do the trick – but there’s certainly some truth in the idea that our bodies start to mirror our minds. And some people, like Bogna, can intuitively pick this up:
A few years ago Bogna was at a dinner party when an acquaintance of her husband limped up to her in the kitchen.
‘What are you carrying on your right hip?’ she asked him. ‘Are you carrying your sister?’
The man looked dumbfounded. Bogna was right, he’d spent years worrying and feeling responsible for his sister’s predicament.
‘Although I didn’t know anything about his sister, I just sensed, very strongly that his sister was the reason his hip was sore and he was limping,’ Bogna said.
‘I certainly can’t always intuit what’s happening in people’s lives – and what’s impacting their bodies- but sometimes if someone asks me a particular question, that information will come.’
While this might all sound a bit ‘woo-woo’ for some of you, anyone who’s familiar with the work of Caroline Myss, Bruce Lipton and Gregg Braden or watched ‘The Living Matrix’ ‘Medical Renaissance- The Secret Code’ or ‘ What the Bleep Do We Know’ (and I’m slightly banking on the fact that some of you have) will know that our bodies are influenced by more than the food we eat, the drugs we take or the number of downward dogs we do.
But for those of you who are sceptical of the mind’s power over the body, here is a bit of scientific theory:
‘ The newest research actually proves that when we feel stressed, the fascia – the connective tissue surrounding our muscles – becomes more dense,’ said Bogna.
While many conventional doctors merely see the fascia as ‘filling’ between our muscles, research over the last five years suggests it’s so much more than that:
‘Pioneers in fascial science – like Robert Schleip from Germany – are discovering that the fascia is more like the heart, a smooth muscle that contracts by itself and responds to emotional stimuli.’
So how does this relate to health and healing?
‘ When I put my fingers on someone’s body – whether it’s their foot, head, or knee – I can feel how a person’s energy moves through the fascia, and I can analyze very quickly what’s going on.’
Bogna’s healing skills have been a godsend for Mum.
Following her hysterectomy Mum was left with a debilitating pain in her groin. When she mentioned it at her post-op, the doctors and nurses had no idea where the pain was coming from – but Bogna did.
‘There was an imbalance in your Mum’s pelvic floor muscle,’ Bogna said. ‘ So we worked on gently strengthening that muscle.’
A few sessions later? The pain vanished.
While Bogna would never call herself a medical intuitive (although she admits to helping people heal from the age of four) there are others who have trained in the art and whose skills have been put to the test.
Edgar Cayce was the most documented medical intuitive to date, with over 9,000 health readings performed over a 40-year-period. He had no medical training but his gift of medical prophecy, while in a deep trance, helped thousands of people during his lifetime (1877-1945).
Then there is Caroline Myss.
Two decades ago, Dr Norm Shealy, a Harvard-trained neurosurgeon, and founder of the prestigious American Holistic Medical Association, conducted a scientific blind study, which revealed Myss had a 93% accuracy rate in medical intuition.
But Myss doesn’t see her Oprah-acclaimed talent as a gift; she views it as an acquired skill and now devotes much of her time to teaching others how to develop their intuitive abilities.
Last week I spoke to Kim Illig, an intuitive healer from Seattle, who trained ( for seven years) with Caroline Myss and Norm Shealy.
Rather than diagnosing disease (she leaves that to doctors) Illig helps clients identify and work through emotional patterns that might be stopping them from healing.
‘ When we get a serious diagnosis it can spark despair, fear, shame or anger and these emotions assist in tissue breakdown in the long term,’ said Illig.
Kim Illig
‘ Blame – whether that’s blaming others or blaming yourself – can also contribute to the healing process being a lot slower and it’s something that we need to clear.’
So can anyone become a medical intuitive?
‘To me, all one has to do to become a medical intuit, theoretically, is have a passion for doing it, just like someone who loves piano would spend years practising and taking lessons,’ said Illig.
‘So in the world of intuitive healing we have the Mozarts, the Beethovens and the Chopins; we have famous concert pianists and we have people who play just for their family at Christmas. Using that metaphor I would consider myself to be a concert pianist –– but I really feel that everybody has the capacity to really know themselves; to be able to take information from their five sensory experience and interpret it in another sense.’
Whether we’re in rude health, on the road to recovery or feeling overwhelmed by the affects of a chronic disease, we all have the power to learn something from our physical experiences and choose not to let them define us.
For years Caroline Myss was plagued by chronic pain and occasional bouts of depression. In Sacred Contracts she writes:
‘ These ailments did not begin to abate until I recognized that I myself had fallen prey to becoming a woundologist- someone who defines herself by the bad things that have happened to her.’
All of us, at some point, fall prey to dwelling on our past hurts – whether it’s a crap relationship or a life changing disease – but we’d do well to notice when we’re trapped in rumination and question whether it’s holding us back or helping us heal.

Professor Ian Brighthope
Posted on January 18, 2012 by Laura
Photo from www.foodmatters.tv
‘What’s the number one thing you’re doing?’ …is a question Mum has been asked a lot in these last few months.
While dealing with unresolved emotions and stress has been essential for Mum, if she were to name one cancer treatment that’s been most critical to her recovery, it would probably be intravenous vitamin C.
Many others would agree – if the demand at Mum’s local clinic is anything to go by. In the lead up to Christmas it was particularly frenetic, with cancer patients desperate to get their IV C fix before the festivities got underway.
While some patients, like Mum, use vitamin C as a standalone therapy, many others use it in combination with conventional treatments like chemotherapy. A few weeks ago, a close friend of mine got the all-clear following a round of chemo and she’s now keen to supercharge her immune system with intravenous C. She recently asked me how it worked and I found myself getting tongue-tied.
So I thought I’d enlist the help of Australia’s leading expert in IV C – Professor Ian Brighthope.
Many of you will recognise Professor Brighthope – a medical doctor and surgeon – from the hit documentary Food Matters.
He has been treating patients with intravenous vitamin C for over 35 years, and, as the previous president of the Australian College of Nutritional & Environmental Medicine (ACNEM), he’s well placed to talk about how it works. Here’s what he had to say:
What are the benefits of having vitamin C therapy alongside conventional treatments?
‘Every benefit in the world,’ said Brighthope.
‘It reduces the toxic effects of chemotherapy, it accelerates the healing after chemotherapy, it reduces the inflammation caused by radiotherapy, it boosts the immune system, it suppresses the bacteria and viruses that may be implicated in causing or aggravating the growth of cancer and it stimulates white blood cells to mop up dead cancerous tissue and fight infection.’
Phew, that’s an impressive list.
So where did you learn about the benefits of high-dose Vitamin C ?
‘I had some clues from Linus Pauling in the US, but I basically taught myself,’ said Brighthope. ‘I used vitamin C experimentally in a cancer patient who was terminal – and the patient lived for another seven years.’
Where it all began
More than thirty years ago, Dr Linus Pauling and Dr Ewan Cameron conducted a number of studies, looking at the effect of vitamin C therapy in cancer patients. In 1971, 100 terminal cancer patients were given 10g (10,000 mg) of vitamin C intravenously a day, compared to a control group of 1000 patients who were treated by conventional methods only. (Just to give you some idea of how much vitamin C we’re talking – the RDI in Australia is 45mg per day).
Five years after the beginning of the study, 18 of the 100 vitamin C-treated patients were still living while all 1000 of the control patients had died (Tomorrow’s Cancer Cures TODAY, Dr Allan Spreen)
More recent research supports these findings. One Japanese study found those suffering from cancer of the uterus lived 15 times longer on vitamin C therapy (International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research, 1982) and last year, New Zealand scientists confirmed that vitamin C helped inhibit tumour growth.
But it’s not just cancer patients who benefit from high-dose vitamin C – in 2009 a New Zealand dairy farmer miraculously recovered from a severe case of swine flu after intravenous C was administered at the eleventh hour. The doctors wanted to turn off this man’s life support, but his family insisted he have the treatment. You can watch the incredible story here (thank you Marie for sharing).
…Back to Brighthope
‘ For acute problems, like an acute virus that’s going to kill somebody, it’s important to give vitamin C as an injection,’ said Brighthope.
Why?
‘You cannot achieve the extremely high physiological level that severely ill patients require by taking it orally, because the more you take orally, the less of a percentage of a dose is absorbed,’ said Brighthope.
The Mayo Clinic study (often cited by conventional doctors as evidence Vitamin C doesn’t work) is a case in point.
Shortly after Pauling and Cameron released the results from their groundbreaking vitamin C study, researchers from the Mayo clinic ran a similar trial - with one key difference. While Pauling and Cameron administered 10g vitamin C intravenously, the Mayo participants were given the same dose orally. And -surprise, surprise- the vitamin C made no difference to survival rates.
So why don’t more people know about Vitamin C?
‘It’s very difficult …when you’ve got a very established profession that’s been dominated by the idea of diseases and drugs and surgery and radiotherapy; a profession that doesn’t know anything about health, yet is a health profession,’ explained Brighthope.
Is it illegal, in Australia, for an oncologist to recommend a patient try vitamin C therapy?
‘No. In fact it’s morally the correct thing to do for an oncologist to support whatever a patient – and or the patient’s family – wants for them. Also, the patient does have legal rights to a therapy that may be unproven.
From a legal point of view they have to practise along accepted guidelines, but the accepted guidelines for oncologists, may not be in the best interests of the patient,’ said Brighthope.
‘Put it this way, if the patient presents to the oncologist with a cancer, and the patient is malnourished and has a lack of protein; a lack of vitamins; a lack of minerals; a lack of essential fatty acids and other deficiencies of nutrients; the oncologist will take absolutely no notice … and will still go ahead with oncology – and oncological drugs – drugs that will compromise the patient’s health even further,’ said Brighthope.
But change is afoot.
‘It has been interesting to see how something [high dose vitamin c] that was regarded as absolute quackery, has become mainstream,’ said Brighthope. ‘In many respects we are at the forefront here in Australia with regard to nutritional medicine. It’s actually now recognised as a part of the GP training from the Royal Australian College of Medicine.’
Other countries are following suit. In the UK there’s pioneers like Dr Patrick Kingsley ( as well as Dr Wendy Denning and Dr Nicola Hembry) in America there’s legends like Dr Gary Gordon and in Mexico you have the likes of Dr Contreras – who have long prescribed IV C to help cancer patients achieve the all-clear.
As I’ve mentioned before the natural cancer journey is anything but clear. Alternative practitioners can be hard to come by, dietary advice can be contradictory and it can be difficult to know where to find the purest and best supplements and products.
It’s for that reason that I’ve mentioned specific brand names on this website – they are products we have both researched and Mum has tried – and we thought people might like to know about them. But I was given pause for thought last week when two subscribers questioned whether I was benefiting financially from product endorsements.
I can tell you, with hand on heart, that Mum and I make nothing from this blog ( in fact, on a few occasions, I’ve turned down paid work so that I have enough time to ensure the blog goes up). It is a labour of love, but one I do gladly, as Mum and I find the feedback, suggestions and stories from other readers profoundly life-affirming.

LifeWave Patches
Posted on January 11, 2012 by Laura
They’ve helped fire victims in Victoria sleep at night.
They’ve boosted the performance and stamina of the US Olympic swimming team.
They’ve even aided thousands of earthquake victims in Italy. As a result they’ve now been introduced into the Italian health care system.
A few months ago, when the Adelaide Advertiser ran a story about Mum’s alternative cancer journey, a man called Bob Harding contacted us (one of the many inspiring people we’ve connected with since starting this blog).
Bob has been a distributor of LifeWave patches for the last three years, after witnessing first-hand, their amazing benefits:
‘I went along to the LifeWave meeting thinking ‘ this is probably going to be a load of crap’ but after seeing the product in action, I joined up as a member.’
A pair of LifeWave patches were placed on Bob’s neck and almost immediately, his debilitating neck pain – which had plagued him for twenty years – disappeared.
Since then, Bob has seen the patches dramatically improve the condition of those suffering from arthritis, autism, ADHD, insomnia, lethargy as well as serious illnesses like cancer – although he is at pains to mention the patches are not responsible for the cure of any disease.
Nonetheless, when you hear about the man who literally got up out of a wheelchair after being patched – or of the lady, riddled with cancer and sent home to die, who’s still alive two years after trying LifeWave – you appreciate the patches are more than a band-aid approach to healing.
Bob will say the patches have been shown to help a variety of conditions common to cancer sufferers, like pain, lack of energy and depression.
‘We’ve helped hundreds of people and we have so many stories – it’s been quite an incredible journey,’ he told me. You can read some of the inspiring testimonials on the website.
So What Are the Patches?
The LifeWave patches are the brainchild of David Schmidt, who spent three years researching ways to increase energy and stamina through using the body’s electromagnetic field.
According to David, the patches promote chemical reactions in the body by acting as a transmitter to boost your electron flow.
Last year LifeWave made the Inc 5000 list of fastest growing companies in the US – for the third consecutive year – and the company has a league of medical professionals and celebrities behind them including Dr Norm Shealy and Suzanne Sommers.
In her best-selling book Knockout (a must-read for anyone embarking on the alternative cancer journey) Sommers says:‘ I love these patches. They are nondrug and do the job perfectly. I couldn’t be without them, and David Schmidt is a genius for creating them.’
What Can The Patches Do?
Where to start? There are seven different patches and they can be used – together or alone – for a variety of different things, in sickness and in health.
Athletes will want the Energy Enhancer patches, those with a spare-tyre might use the SP6 patches to stave off hunger. Then there are the IceWave patches for pain… and for insomniacs? Silent Nights are the knights in shining armour.
One of the most heartwarming stories Bob told me was about how these patches had transformed the life of a Korean War veteran. This 90-year-old man has spent the best part of a century waking up screaming. Now, thanks to the Silent Knight patches, him (and his wife) sleep at night.
The BIG Hitters
If you’re fighting a life-threatening disease, like cancer, the Y-age Carnosine and the Y-age Glutathione patches are likely to help you the most.
As some of you may recall, Mum and I are big believers in glutathione – this vital antioxidant can neutralize free radicals, boost natural killer cells and detoxify the liver. (You can read more about it here). Sadly, most of us don’t produce enough glutathione.
In a recent study these non-transdermal patches were shown to increase levels of glutathione in the body by a whopping 454%.
In the same study, urine mercury levels spiked in some of the subjects, suggesting the increased levels of glutathione were also aiding detoxification.
‘ The patch has a massive detoxing effect, it literally draws the drugs, chemicals, mercury straight out of the body,’ said Bob.
The glutathione patches can also improve organ function:
‘ If you put the glutathione patch or the carnosine patch on an acupuncture point – say the lung meridian, or the heart meridian – you will help repair those organs and that has been clinically measured.’
In one published study (and there are many more on this page if you’re interested) the carnosine patch, worn 12 hours daily on alternative days over a period of two weeks, resulted in a ‘very significant’ improvement in the functional status of the pancreas, liver, right kidney, left and right adrenals, hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid glands.
Not only is carnosine a powerful free radical scavenger, cell repairer and chelator – it’s also renowned for it’s anti-ageing properties.
Thus the patch’s name ‘Y-Age-Carnosine’.
Better than Crème de la Mer?
‘ All the wrinkles on my forehead have just about gone and the age spots have practically disappeared,’ said Bob.
His varicose veins have vanished too.
Mum has been using the patches for a few months now and, along with feeling more alert and energized (she can kayak all day) she’s had plenty of people tell her how well she looks.
Of course looks are of little concern when you’re dealing with cancer – or so you think until you get a compliment.
While Mum has been happy to forgo expensive face creams for organic, non-toxic alternatives since her diagnosis, she hasn’t entirely let go of her desire to hold back the years.
Could these patches be the answer?
Who knows, but there’s certainly truth in getting your beauty sleep.

Frankincense & Mistletoe
Posted on December 21, 2011 by Laura
I was going to make this blog-post a light-hearted one…something about simple holiday pleasures (falling asleep while reading about Eleanor of Aquitaine) or maybe a little vignette about the deeper appreciation of Christmas, when someone you love has had cancer.
I figured – ‘who has the time, or the inclination, to read about clinical trials and cancer treatments when there’s champagne to be popped and hangovers to be nursed?’
But then… Mum came home from Ozone therapy yesterday and mentioned that one of her friends had been advised – by an American practitioner- to rub frankincense into the area where her cancer was.
So it seemed like the right time to share with you a little about how frankincense and mistletoe might help with cancer– and if you’re not in the mood, then feel free to save this for the New Year, when you’re not trying to stuff a turkey or wrap-up a skateboard.
Three Wise Men
No wonder frankincense was chosen by one of the Magi to give to baby Jesus.
Thousands of years ago it was equal in value to gold; the Ancient Egyptians, who used frankincense in many of their rituals and purification ceremonies, thought it to be the ‘sweat of the Gods’, while the Greeks and Romans used it to treat a wide variety of diseases.
Indeed, if the three wise men had arrived in Bethlehem a little earlier their gift of frankincense might have helped Mary through her childbirth: it is thought to reduce hyperventilation during labour.
Today frankincense – which comes from the resin of the Boswellia Sacra tree – is used to treat depression, gout, eczema, scarring, insomnia AND cancer.
According to medical research it’s been shown to halt the proliferation of numerous cancer cells, including leukemia cells, melanoma cells, bladder cancer cells, colon cancer cells, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer cells.
Mahmoud Suhail, an immunologist, has been studying the beneficial effects of frankincense for years.
He’s currently working alongside medical scientists from the University of Oklahoma to determine just how frankincense stops cancer from spreading.
‘Cancer starts when the DNA code within the cell’s nucleus becomes corrupted,’ he explained recently in a BBC interview.
‘It seems frankincense has a re-set function. It can tell the cell what the right DNA code should be. Frankincense separates the ‘brain’ of the cancerous cell – the nucleus – from the ‘body’ – the cytoplasm, and closes down the nucleus to stop it reproducing corrupted DNA codes.’
The highest quality frankincense comes from Oman – but you needn’t cross-deserts to get hold of it – you can buy it online from Young Living Oils (be sure to order the essential frankincense oil rather than the sacred frankincense oil).
As a little aside, you might also be interested in the therapeutic benefits of the other Wise Man gift – Myrrh. It’s meant to help with sore throats, gum disorders, inflammation, digestive problems and cellulite. You can read more about it here.
Kissing Cancer Goodbye
More than just an excuse for a Christmas party smooch, Mistletoe is the most commonly used oncological drug in Germany .
Thousands of years ago, the druids of Europe also used it as a contraceptive (strange to think that an old-school prophylactic is now hung above doors to encourage wanton behaviour).
But I digress…
8 MIILLION cancer patients have benefited from Mistletoe – in conjunction with conventional therapies – over the past few decades, according to one report, from the Mapapo Institute (German – Argentine Institute for Oncologic and Immunologic Investigations).
Iscador, a specific extract of Mistletoe, has been used in controlled pilot studies in the Berlin University, Witten/Herdecke, Germany and the University of California, San Francisco, USA, for breast, colon, prostate, brain, intestine cancer, cervical dysplasia, ovary, stomach and lungs, and in metastasis processes.
One study, published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine in 2001, looked at the survival times of patients with cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach, breast and lung.
1668 patients were treated with Iscador while 8475 had conventional treatment only. Survival time in the Iscardor group was roughly 40% longer than in the control groups.
So How Does it Work?
Mistletoe can increase natural-killer cells and increase the cytotoxicity of macrophages (in other words, it puts the guns in the hands of the good guys).
According to Dr Keith Scott-Mumby in Cancer Research Secrets there are different forms of Mistletoe based on the tree from which it is harvested. So you have M for Malus ( apple); P for Pinus (pine); Q for Quercus (oak); and U for Ulmus (elm) with each having specific benefits for different types of cancer.
So it’s worth doing your research if you’re considering adding Mistletoe to your treatment arsenal. It’s also important to note that mistletoe can be toxic and you need to find a qualified homeopath or alternative doctor who can treat you safely.
The cancer charity Yes to Life has an extensive list of practitioners – mostly in Europe – on their website. http://www.yestolife.org.uk/treatment_display.php/15
Mince Pie Therapy
If only….
I would also like to end by saying a huge thank you for your support, stories and suggestions over the last few months. Having such lovely feedback from you has been as important to Mum as the advice from her practitioners.
May the learning and sharing continue, and may health, happiness and hope follow you all through 2012.
Merry Christmas
Xx

A Kernel of Truth
Posted on December 14, 2011 by Laura
Ever heard of Vitamin B17?
It’s found in apricot kernels, bitter almonds and various other fruits and seeds – and there’s evidence, dating back 2700BC, of it’s incredible healing properties.
In his book B17 Metabolic Therapy in the prevention and control of Cancer Phillip Day lists a few historic references:
‘The great Persian apothecary and medical practitioner Avicenna used bitter almond oil to treat tumours of the uterus, spleen, stomach and liver.’
‘In the 13th century…Myreposos, a Byzantine physician, used bitter almonds to treat cancer of the oral cavity. In the same century Ibn-Al-Baitar was also using bitter almonds to treat breast cancer. Later, in the 16th century, we find a Swiss biologist called Gesner using the same almonds to treat cancer. … By the 19th century, bitter almonds were an accepted treatment for cancer both on the Old Continent and in the New World.’
In the1970s cancer doctors around the world – Dr Manuel Navarro (Philippines), Dr Ernesto Contreras (Mexico) and Dr Hans Nieper (Germany) Dr Philip Binzel (America) – were experimenting with B17 ( also known as Laetrile and amygdalin) and witnessing phenomenal results.
During a visit to the US in 1972 Dr Nieper told reporters:
‘ After more than twenty years of such specialized work, I have found non-toxic nitrilosides – that is, Laetrile – far superior to any other known cancer treatment or preventative. In my opinion it is the only existing possibility for the ultimate control of cancer.’
So how can apricot kernels reverse cancer?
Cancer cells contain an enzyme called beta-glucosidase – this makes up part of the cancer cell ‘wall.’
When this enzyme comes into contact with nitrilosides, an amazing transformation occurs – much like when Eric eats a banana.
These nitrilosides turn into the tumourcidal trio of glucose, benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.
This trio attack cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone.
Want proof?
Dr Binzel’s book Alive and Well is full of testimonies from cancer patients brought back from the brink with Laetrile and nutritional therapy.
One 44-year-old woman with metastasized colon cancer was still cancer free, 13 years after being treated with Laetrile (no chemo, no radio).
The odds of her reaching a 5 year survival had she undergone ‘conventional’ therapy?
One in a thousand.
Then there’s Polly Todd, a 59-year-old woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer (spread to her lymph nodes) in 1975.
She was told her odds of survival were ‘slim’ and she was urged to have chemotherapy and radiation. Instead she chose to have Laetrile and nutritional therapies with Dr Binzel. When his book was published – 19 years later – she was 79 years old and had not had a recurrence of the disease.
Dr Binzel decided to ditch chemo and radio in the 1970s and start treating his patients with nutritional therapies instead.
In Alive and Well he acknowledges this choice wasn’t an easy one:
‘ My biggest problem at the time was understanding nutrition. In four years of medical school, one year of Family Practice residency, I had not had even one lecture on nutrition.’
Of the 180 patients Dr Binzel treated with primary cancer 87.3 % did not die of their cancer after 18 years.
In the year that Dr Binzel published his results the American Cancer Society was officially reporting that with conventional treatment – involving early detection and primary cancer – 85% of cancer patients would die within five years.
A Deadly Poison?
The FDA would have you believe that, since Laetrile contains cyanide, it’s dangerously toxic.
To borrow a cockney phrase that’s just plain ‘chicken oriental’ (mental).
A tonne of toxicity studies have been done on B17 confirming that it’s harmless to healthy cells.
(I won’t bore you with them now, but feel free to click here if you’re interested.)
You only need look at the Hunza people in the Himalayas to know that a diet rich in apricot seeds will keep you in near perfect health. The Hunzas are renowned for their longevity – it is common for a Hunzakut to live to be over 100 years old.
It is also extremely uncommon for the Hunzakuts to get cancer.
But Laetrile is dangerous to some people – namely conventional oncologists, radiologists and anyone else who’s likely to lose out from the therapy becoming widely available.
To understand just how much of a threat laetrile/B17/apricot kernels is to the cancer establishment, it’s worth reading Ralph Moss’ book The Cancer Industry.
Ralph Moss was a Phd science writer when he was hired to work at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in 1974. He later became an assistant of public affairs where he was told to distribute negative statements about Laetrile. The following is taken from his now famous interview with radio show host Laura Lee.
RM. …Shortly after I went to work there I went to visit an elderly Japanese scientist, Kanematsu Sugiura, who astonished me when he told me he was working on Laetrile (B17), at the time it was the most controversial thing in cancer ..reputed to be a cure for cancer. We in public affairs were giving out statements that Laetrile was worthless, it was quackery, and people should not abandon proven therapies. I was astonished that our most distinguished scientist would be bothering with something like this, and I said why are you doing this if it does not work. He took down lab books and showed me that in fact Laetrile is dramatically effective in stopping the spread of cancer. The animals were genetically programmed to get breast cancer and about 80 – 90% of them normally get spread of the cancer from the breast to the lungs which is a common route in humans, also for how people die of breast cancer, and instead when they gave the animals Laetrile by injection only 10-20% of them got lung metasteses. And these facts were verified by many people, including the pathology department.
LL So this is verified, that Laetrile can have this positive effect?
RM We were finding this and yet we in public affairs were told to issue statements to the exact opposite of what we were finding scientifically, and as the years went by I got more rapped up in this thing and 3 years later I said all this in my own press conference, and was fired the next day, “for failing to carry out his most basic job responsibility”–ie to lie to the public what goes on in cancer research.
………
But even those who know the truth about Laetrile face an uphill battle getting hold of it.
Phillip Day, photo from Food Matters
A few years ago Phillip Day looked into what was required to sell Laetrile in England.
They health authorities informed him that he simply needed to buy a licence… and come up with 150 million to buy the licence.
‘Here in England no doctor is going to advertise that he does Laetrile,’ Day said when I spoke to him recently. ‘It’s not that Laetrile is illegal, it’s that it’s unlicensed.’
You can order apricot kernels, grown without pesticides or other chemicals, from the Credence Website.
‘The great thing about apricot kernels is they come with their own enzymes. So they’re a belt and braces treatment in one,’ said Day.
A Kernel of Confusion
The vital difference between eating the apricot kernals and having Laetrile/B17 injections is that the latter must be done in conjunction with enzymes.
Pancreatic enzymes are essential to break the shell of the cancer cell – so the Laetrile can get in and do its work. You can read more about enzymes here.
Mum discovered this vital information when she was chatting to her friend Barbara while having Laetrile one day. Barbara recommended she take a particular enzyme supplement called Univase Forte.
Barbara’s son is currently battling brain cancer and, as you can imagine, she’s doing everything in her power to ensure he has the best chance of survival.
But sometimes the red-tape that surrounds so many of these alternative treatments, makes her feel like she’s banging her head against a brick wall.
A few weeks ago there was a problem with Barbara’s order of Laetrile. Having Laetrile therapy in Australia requires you to jump through so many hoops it would test even a Cirque Du Soleil performer and, with all the calls to Mexico and complicated forms to fill out, it also demands the patience of a saint.
And that’s just who Barbara decided she needed to call on a few weeks ago.
When her son had gone two weeks without Laetrile Barbara started to panic – and pray.
For three consecutive nights she called upon Archangel Raphael, who looks over healers and healing, to aid in the swift delivery of this much needed medicine.
On the fourth day she called Australian Customs to find out whether it had arrived. A young man picked up the phone. ‘I’m so sorry but we’re just drowning in packages at the moment – it could be days until I can even let you know whether yours is here.’
Barbara explained how desperate she was for the package and the man promised to do his best. She left her number.
About an hour later he called her back with good news. ‘ I can’t believe it! Your package was sticking out the top of the pile – I’ll have it to you by tomorrow.’
Barbara thanked the man profusely. ‘What is your name?’ she asked.
‘Raphael’ he replied.

Modified Citrus Pectin
Posted on December 6, 2011 by Laura
‘What was that anti-cancer thing Frieda mentioned?’ Mum wondered aloud, a few days after her diagnosis.
She didn’t have to wonder long.
Frieda, one of Mum’s oldest friends, telephoned as soon as she heard the news: ‘Don’t forget about Modified Citrus Pectin!’ she said.
Years ago, Frieda had told Mum about a friend who cured himself of a ‘nasty’ case of prostate cancer, with the help of modified citrus pectin (MCP). When his wife got breast cancer, a few years later, she also conquered the disease using this powerful remedy.
Mum took the MCP, in powder form, every morning for the first three months following her surgery. She mixed ten grams a day in a small glass of juice and apparently, it was fairly easy to take. (The same can’t be said for all anti-cancer concoctions – Mum’s Graviola mix is always taken with a grimace).
What is Modified Citrus Pectin?
Pectin is found in the peel of apples, citrus fruits and plums and is often used to make jellies.
But while ordinary pectin might make your dessert wobble, it won’t shake your cancer.
Why? Because it cannot be absorbed by the digestive system.
Modified citrus pectin on the other hand, comes from the pulp and rinds of citrus fruits – like oranges and grapefruits – which have been altered to produce shorter sugar chains. Thanks to these shorter sugar chains, the pectin is more easily absorbed through the intestinal tract and into the bloodstream.
MCP halts Metastasis
For cancer cells to metastasize, or spread, they must clump together. Substances on the surface of cancer cells called ‘galectins’ are thought to be responsible for this.
One specific ‘lectin’ called galectin-3 has been linked to cancer development.
Elevated levels have been found in tissue samples of thyroid cancer, breast cancer and pituitary cancer.
Galectin-3 has also been shown to play a role in metastasis.
Galectin Assassin
Research now shows that a substance in MCP called ‘galactose’, can block cancer cells from clumping-together and taking over.
Over the last ten years researchers have found that MCP can block metastasis in a myriad of different cancers including skin cancers, prostate cancer and breast cancer.
In one study involving melanoma cells, MCP decreased tumour metastasis to the lung by more than 90%.
Another study, published in the journal Oncology, found that 20.7% of patients with advanced solid tumours taking MCP, showed a clinical benefit.
Mopping up the Underlying Cause
MCP is also known as a powerful chelating agent, meaning it can draw toxins out of the body.
What does this have to do with cancer?
A lot.
‘Until toxicity is effectively addressed, no significant advance in cancer survival will ever happen,’ writes Dr Rashid Buttar says in The 9 Steps to Keep the Doctor Away.
Dr Patrick Holford goes further: ‘ Possibly one of the most underestimated contributors to the epidemic of cancer is the combined effect of humanity’s exposure to man made chemicals.’ Say No to Cancer.
Chemical exposure is frequently cited as a risk factor for childhood cancers.
One US study found children with brain cancer were more likely to have been exposed to insecticides in the home.
It’s also been suggested that agricultural chemicals are responsible for the increase in certain cancers among farmers. (page 88 Say No to Cancer).
But you don’t need to live next to Big-Agri to dose up on chemicals. A quick trip to the dentist, a glass of tap water, a gasp of air will insure you imbibe your fair share of lead, cadmium, mercury and more.
And if you don’t believe these chemicals cause cancer just take a cursory look at some of the studies on Toxline. You’ll find 643 studies linking mercury with cancer alone.
So detoxing is essential for anyone interested in optimal heath, not just for cancer patients. But it needs to be done safely, and that’s where MCP comes in.
When you go on a detox-programme, you release toxins stored in your fat-cells.
When the toxins are released into the blood stream they can travel to your heart, your brain, your kidneys – wreaking havoc.
But when you take MCP, it circulates in the bloodstream, latching onto toxins before they reach your vital organs.
MCP’s awesome ability to eliminate toxins from the body was demonstrated in a recent USDA study.
Scientists gave MCP to people for six days and then tested the amount of toxins excreted in their urine.
After just twenty-four hours the amount of arsenic in patients urine increased by 130%, the amount of mercury increased by 150%, the amount of cadmium increased by 230% and the amount of toxic lead increased why a whopping 560%.
MCP is so safe it’s been tested on five year olds suffering from lead poisoning.
Back to Galectins
Galectin-3 has recently been implicated in heart disease. Elevations of galectin-3 were found in nearly two thirds of patients hospitalized for heart failure, according to a recent report from the Health Sciences Institute.
Thankfully all you need to do to lower your levels is to dose up on modified grapefruit pulp!
So let’s just re-cap.
Modified Citrus Pectin might stop your cancer in its tracks, save you from a heart attack AND rid your body of deadly poisons.
That’s an impressive list of health benefits.
But if you’re going to entrust a supplement with such vital tasks you want to make sure you’re getting the real deal.
While a few different health brands produce MCP, there’s one that comes up time and time again and it’s called PectaSol C by Econugenics Inc: www.econugenics.com.
It can sometimes be tricky to order supplements from America, but I’ve just spoken to Buffy at Eco Nugenics who assures me they ship to Australia. For international orders you need to call this number (0011) 707-521-3370.
After discussing this week’s post with Mum she has now ordered another batch – it can be easy to forget certain anti-cancer gems when there’s so many to consider.
But when you peel back the layers, you find a few things worth sticking too.

Documentaries, the new drugs?
Posted on November 30, 2011 by Laura
There’s no way of getting around it. When you’re told you have cancer, there’s going to be some nightmare moments, whatever path you take.
The overwhelming desire to go back to an old, pre-cancer, reality is torturous, to say the least. And I’m only getting this second-hand.
For Mum, the first few weeks were pretty grim. After a particularly trying weekend I remember her saying, ‘Is this it? Is this what my life is going to be like now?’
Before she’d started to heal, and before we’d discovered just how many cancer miracles were out there, it all seemed a bit hopeless.
But then we started to watch, to read to listen – and if you were very quiet, you could hear the hope trickle in.
If someone you love gets cancer, don’t send them comfort food (too much of a minefield). Send them one of these life-affirming DVDs instead:
Medical Renaissance – The Secret Code
Watch it because… it’s like being wrapped-up in a toasty warm towel. In the opening scene you see the quirky Dr Norm Shealy feeding his horse ‘Spotlight’ while the sun rises in Missouri. Your heart rate slows.
The Gist… Three desperate patients, all with chronic conditions and/or depression, are given a chance to transform their lives.
In 90 minutes you’re given a glimpse into what the future of healing will look like – a future where Aspirin and Xanax make way for ‘natural narcotics’, past life therapy and copper pyramids and Tesla cords.
Shealy pulls no punches about conventional medicine and the ‘PharmacoMafia’ but his infectious laugh and laid-back manner seems to say ‘change comes slowly’ – and with a smile.
Best Lines…
‘As my father said, common sense, is the most uncommon commodity.’
‘It’s a lot easier to say, ‘My back hurts,’ than ‘My life hurts.’
www.medicalrenaissance.net
Cancer is Curable Now
Watch it because…You’re probably the only one who hasn’t.
The Gist…Marcus Freudenmann and his wife Sabrina, a naturopathic doctor, traveled the world with their four children interviewing world-renowned cancer experts – the likes of Dr. Connealy, Dr Douwes, Dr Gary Gordon – rockstars of the alternative cancer world.
The movie is shocking (‘people aren’t dying of cancer, they’re dying of the treatment’) illuminating (‘BPA is one of the main causes of prostate and breast cancer’) and uplifting – just listen to the stories of patients with bone, lung and liver cancer cured by Hyperthermia.
Best Lines…
‘ We need to change people from victims to ‘victors’ of cancer.’
‘ Many years from now people will look back at this time and wonder what kind of Neanderthals we were.’
www.canceriscurablenow.com
Burzynski: The Movie
Watch it Because… If someone you love has been given a death sentence – Dr Burzynksi could be their life-line.
The Gist… The Texas Medical Board (and the FDA) has waged a ten-year war on Dr Burzynski. Why? Because he’s dared to create a cancer treatment that actually works – Antineoplastons – and Cancer Inc is missing out on the windfall.
The remarkable stories from patients will have you both bawling your eyes out and boiling with anger.
Read more about his story – and how you can help him in his latest legal battle – here.
Best Lines…
‘Dr. Burzynski had MRIs of brain tumors, known to be almost universally fatal, that had simply disappeared. It was obvious to me that Dr. Burzynski had made the most important discovery in cancer treatment — ever.’ Dr Julian Whitaker
‘not withstanding that… it’s possible to indict a ham sandwich – probably there’s not much there.’ Comment from a committee member, during the 1995 grand Jury – the 5th against Burzynski.
www.burzynskimovie.com
Rooted
Watch it Because… your teeth matter more than you think.
The Gist… When you have a root canal filling (a procedure to ‘save’ a dead tooth) you run the risk of developing cancer, sinusitis, Multiple Sclerosis, arthritis and more.
This documentary will have your stomach churning at the toxic substances routinely deployed by dentists (some products don’t meet the safety standards for the sewage system) and thinking twice about where you want to book your next check-up.
Best Lines…
‘ Dentistry is the only medical profession that thinks it’s a good idea to keep dead, gangrenous tissue in the body.’
‘A tooth that is dead is dead is dead. There’s no such thing as a little bit dead.’
www.rooted.tv
Food Matters
Watch it because…it will send shivers up your spine (just re-watching the trailer gave me goosebumps).
The Gist… Featuring some of today’s most recognisable health heroes this revolutionary documentary demonstrates how vitamin C can cure cancer, why B3 is better than prozac and why 106,000 people die every year in America from pharmaceutical drugs.
‘I love that film, not just because I’m in it, but because people watch it and their attitude immediately changes,’ said Phillip Day when I spoke to him recently. ‘All of a sudden they’re not resentful when you start explaining the changes they need to make to their lifestyle – they really understand why they need to do these things.’
Best Lines…
‘ Good health makes a lot of sense, but it doesn’t make a lot of dollars.’ Andrew Saul
‘ You can be sincere, and you can be sincerely wrong.’ Phillip Day
www.foodmatters.tv/
The Living Matrix
Watch in Because…the sooner you understand that your thoughts affect your biology, the sooner you can change them.
The Gist…The body has an awesome capacity to heal itself. Don’t believe me? Just listen to Arielle whose brain tumour disappeared after Emotional Release Therapy or Edgar who worked with a ‘dream healer’ to cure his kidney cancer.
The film features the likes of Bruce Lipton, a renowned cell biologist, who has spent the last three decades studying quantam physics and looking at how our emotions affect us on a molecular level.
Best Lines…
‘At least one third of all healings – including drugs, surgery and other allopathic interventions – have …to do with the placebo affect.’ Bruce Lipton
‘One of the fundamental things that has to change in the future of medicine, is this focus on the gene, as being the solution to every illness,’ Lynne McTaggart
www.thelivingmatrixmovie.com
One Answer to Cancer
Watch it Because…you’ll find out about a treatment that boasts a 100% success rate for treating primary breast cancer.
The Gist… Aldara is the devil; black salve is the saviour.
The Australian government has known, since 1986, that the active ingredient in Aldara (a skin cancer cream) causes cancer.
This first part of the film follows the battle waged by Elaine Hollingsworth on Big Pharma following her near death experience using Aldara (which has now been taken off the market).
The second part of the film is dedicated to the miraculous black salve. You’ll hear from a courageous woman who rushed to the bathroom following a biopsy to insert black salve into her breast cancer (now cured) and countless other tales from people who owe their life to this (illegal) salve.
Best Lines…
‘ Everything revolved around me saving my own hide with my own hands rather than relying on the butchers.’ Skin cancer patient cured himself using black salve.
‘When the freedom for people to decide what they want is lost, when doctors no longer have the right to seek the truth or search for alternatives. When central control of everything we do is absolute, then that is the time when we have totally lost our freedom and the ability to progress.’ Dr Michael Tait
www.oneanswertocancermovie.com/info.htm
Many people have also recommended Healing Cancer From the Inside Out with Mike Anderson.
I haven’t had a chance to watch it yet, but I’d love to hear from you if you have – or if you’ve seen any other film that changed the way you thought about health and healing.

Q&A with Phillip Day
Posted on November 23, 2011 by Laura
Photo from www.foodmatters.tv
Re: truth about cancer
‘Finally someone has gone public with this. my dad recently passed away with advanced brain cancer, he wanted to live so badly and the last 18 months were torture, so sick after the chemo, even worse after avastin, the little time he had was taken from him with all these fake promises.
you look fantastic & so healthy, & i wish you all the best & surround yourself with happy positive people
please read this book ( I borrowed a copy from my local library)
Cancer; Why We`re Still Dying To Know The Truth by Phillip Day.’
I recently received this lovely (but sad) email from a reader – she isn’t the first to recommend Phillip Day.
In the last few months I’ve been inundated with emails and tweets from people telling me about Phillip Day’s life-changing workshops and books.
If you’ve seen Food Matters you’ll recognize Phillip as the fast-talking English journalist who sums up (in just a few sound-bites) all that is wrong with the modern medical establishment.
When he’s not being a film star, Phillip Day is writing eye-opening reports, advising cancer doctors around the world, speaking at conferences and writing books (he’s even written a technical manual about B17 therapy for doctors – and, believe it or not, many have read it too).
I had the privilege (and pleasure) of speaking with him on Monday.
Here’s what he had to say…
If you’re diagnosed with cancer today, how much better is your life expectancy than if you were diagnosed 30 years ago?
‘It isn’t. The five-year or better survival rates for almost all forms of cancer officially remain almost unchanged.
There isn’t one study you can show me that demonstrates that chemotherapy, or radiation or surgery extend life in the major epithelial cancers.
The cancer industry has failed, to such an extent that they’ve had to redefine the word ‘cure’ to only mean five years after initial treatment.
Take my aunt as an example. My aunt got breast cancer, she had all the chemo you can imagine – despite my best efforts to persuade her otherwise – and she survived five years, so she’s forever immortalized in the Cancer Research UK database as a cancer survivor.
Of course she hit the five-year mark and died six months after that.
So she’s ‘cured’ and dead.’
Why do millions still believe in the power of chemotherapy?
‘Because that’s the only thing they’ve been told they can do.
When you get a cancer diagnosis you’re frightened and you’re looking around to see who’s going to offer you the best promise of further life. Of course everyone wants to trust their doctors so they go to the doctor and say ‘Hey, I’ve got cancer, what’s my best choice?’
The information they’re given is coloured by the fact these people are trained in institutions funded by the drug industry. And so they only get that particular side of it.
The cure for cancer is the immune system: the very thing that traditional treatments devastate. Which might explain why we (in England) have the worst cancer survival rates of any western, industrialized nation.
You’re better going off to Latvia because at least they can’t afford the chemo out there.’
What’s the biggest myth about chemotherapy?
‘The biggest myth is that you can pour ‘X’ chemical warfare agents into a human being and believe that you’re going to cure them.
And when you get to radiation, how many people know that radiation causes cancer?’
What is Cancer?
‘Cancer is basically a fungus (more on that later) and the degree that it can spread in the body, is the degree to which the immune system will let it.
If your immune system is weak, the fungus is going to come out, feed on trapped sugars, and start to create mischief.
Along comes a doctor and says ‘ Right, the best cure for this is chemo,’ and what they’re after is tumour shrinkage, but tumour shrinkage is not the same thing as curing cancer.’
Why?
‘Cancer is not a localized lesion; cancer is a systemic issue.
You can cut tumours out of the human breast all day long and they keep growing back, the reason they grow back is that you never rescued the immune system.’
Every year people give billions to cancer charities. Where’s all that money going?
‘It’s going back into the drug industry. It’s a very lucrative scam. Every October we have four thousand women in Maidstone, who are persuaded to strip down to their brassieres and run around Mote Park to raise money to give back to the drug companies that killed their mum and dads.’
How can you prove that?
‘Cancer charities are making no secret of the fact they’re raising money for cancer research. Who’s doing the cancer research? The drug companies.
So the money is going to the drug companies and yet we have thousands of studies that show nutrition can cure cancer, we have all kinds of doctors… are you aware of Stanislaw Burzynksi? He’s curing cancer using Antineoplastons.
They (the pharmaceutical companies via the FDA) are going after him right now, they’re desperate to get this guy down and put him in jail (You can read more about that here). They’re desperate to persecute all of these doctors using B17 (found in apricot kernals) or doctors administering intravenous C.
Anywhere you go you’ll see the iron first comes down on people who are daring to say that food can cure anything.
In fact you’ve just seen the European Union issue this asinine ruling that water doesn’t cure dehydration.
And if you claim that water can cure dehydration you go to prison for two years!’
And didn’t Congress just announce that pizza was a vegetable?
‘It was the same week Laura, the same week.’
So what’s the answer to cancer?
‘There’s a huge amount more we can do – vitamin D, for instance, is a very big player in cancer because it underpins the proper working of the immune system. Then there’s exercise, stress-management… there is a total package now that is extremely effective.
I highly recommend you watch Healing Cancer from Inside Out with Mike Anderson.
On there you’ll see doctors – like Charlotte Gerson – who are taking cancer patients and putting them on a 100% plant based, 100% raw food diet which boosts the immune system and the immune system kills the cancer.
What Stanislaw is doing, what these other doctors – the B17 doctors, the vitamin C infusion doctors, the Essiac brigade and everything else – all these different modalities that seem to work with cancer, in fact don’t cure cancer, they enable the body to cure it.’
But chemotherapy does seem to work for some people…
‘The chemotherapy might have shrunk the tumour to the point where the patient is sent home, but what’s never recorded is maybe then the patient thought: ‘I better start looking after myself.’ That’s going to have a major, major affect on someone.
I love doctors who at the end of their careers make certain statements, because you know those statements come with all the gravitas and all of the intelligence that they’ve accumulated over their long and distinguished career. Anyway, one of the greatest doctors who ever lived, Albert Schweitzer said:
‘ It’s supposed to be a secret, but I’ll tell you anyway. We doctors do nothing, we only help and encourage the doctor within.’
If you go over that statement, there are quite a few illuminating things.
Firstly ‘It’s supposed to be a secret.’
Why?
Because doctors would lose their sovereignty, they would lose this whole mystic that they weave around people. It’s like a religion – I often call it the religion of medicine.
It’s like the priests of the medieval ages who held their power over the common folk by keeping the scriptures in Latin, so people couldn’t read them. But then, along comes Martin Luther…
(Martin Luther famously translated the Bible -previously in Latin- into the language of the people).
Today, it’s not Martin Luther, it’s the internet.
When people get cancer, the first thing they’ll say to me is ‘I’ve got cancer, how many apricot kernels should I take?’
And I tell them: ‘What you should be saying is, I’ve got cancer, what education should I have?’
Until next week…

OverviewQuestions and Answers About Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Cancer TreatmentChanges to This Summary (09/09/2011)Top of page OverviewComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine (see Question 1).It is important that the same scientific evaluation that is used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies (see Question 4). The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine are sponsoring or cosponsoring various clinical trials (research studies with people) to study CAM therapies for cancer (see Question 6). It is important that patients inform all of their health care providers about any therapies they are currently using or considering. This is to help ensure a safe and coordinated course of care (see Question 8).Top of page Questions and Answers About Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Cancer TreatmentWhat is complementary and alternative medicine? Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), as defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), is a group of different medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. Conventional medicine is medicine that is practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by health professionals who work with them, including physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Other terms for conventional medicine include allopathy; Western, mainstream, orthodox, and regular medicine; and biomedicine. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of CAM.This summary answers some frequently asked questions about the use of CAM therapies among the general public and about how CAM therapies are evaluated, and suggests sources for more information.What is integrative medicine?NCCAM defines integrative medicine as treatment that combines conventional medicine with CAM therapies that have been reported to be safe and effective after being studied in patients. In practice, many CAM therapies used in along with conventional medicine have not yet been well tested.Are complementary and alternative therapies widely used?Yes. Many CAM approaches are used by a large percentage of people in the general public and cancer patients.The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reported about 4 out of 10 adults used CAM therapy in the past 12 months, with the most commonly used treatments being natural products and deep breathing exercises. One large survey of cancer survivors reported on the use of complementary therapies. The therapies used most often were prayer and spiritual practice (61%), relaxation (44%), faith and spiritual healing (42%), and nutritional supplements and vitamins (40%). CAM therapies are used by 31-84% of children with cancer, both in and outside of clinical trials. CAM therapies have been used in the management of side effects caused by cancer or cancer treatment. How are CAM approaches evaluated?It is important that CAM therapies be evaluated with the same long and careful research process used to evaluate conventional treatments. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. A listing of these trials is available at the OCCAM Clinical Trials Web page.Conventional cancer treatments have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of many CAM therapies. Research of CAM therapies has been slower for a number of reasons: Time and funding issues.Problems finding institutions and cancer researchers to work with on the studies.Regulatory issues.Some CAM therapies have undergone careful evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally meant to be alternative treatments are finding a place in cancer treatment as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or possibly harmful.What is the NCI Best Case Series Program?The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches that warrant NCI-initiated research.Are NCI and NCCAM sponsoring clinical trials in complementary and alternative medicine?NCI and NCCAM are currently sponsoring or cosponsoring various clinical trials to study complementary and alternative treatments for patients with cancer. Some of these trials study the effects of complementary approaches used in addition to conventional treatments, while others compare alternative therapies with conventional treatments. Current trials include the following:Electroacupuncture to treat delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients diagnosed with pediatric sarcoma, neuroblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, germ cell tumors, or Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT00040911).Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on doxorubicin blood levels in women undergoing treatment of breast cancer (NCT00976131).Curcumin for reducing skin reactions caused by radiation therapy in breast cancer patients (NCT01042938).Acupuncture to prevent dry mouth and improve quality of life in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation (NCT01266044).Effect of Tai Chi versus structured exercise on physical fitness and stress reduction in cancer survivors (NCT00246818).Acupressure for persistent cancer-related fatigue (NCT01281904).Patients who are interested in taking part in these or any clinical trials should talk with their doctor.Several clinical trials databases offer patients, family members, and health professionals information about research studies that use CAM. Clinical trials can be found by searching the following:The NCI's PDQ Clinical Trials Database, which can be searched by using criteria such as cancer type, type of trial, geographic region, trial sponsorship, and/or drug name. This information is also available by calling the NCI's Cancer Information Service (1-800-4-CANCER
[1-800-422-6237];
TTY: 1-800-332-8615).The NCCAM Clinical Trials Web page, which can be searched by the type of treatment or disease. The OCCAM Clinical Trials Web page, which provides links to NCI's PDQ Clinical Trials Database.The Clinical Trials.Gov Web page, which can be searched by the type of medical condition or intervention.What should patients do when using or considering complementary and alternative therapies?Cancer patients using or considering complementary or alternative therapy should discuss this decision with their doctor or nurse, as they would any therapeutic approach. Some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is also a good idea to become informed about the therapy, including whether the results of scientific studies support the claims that are made for it. Some resources for this information are provided in Question 9.When considering complementary and alternative therapies, what questions should patients ask their health care providers?What benefits can be expected from this therapy?What are the risks associated with this therapy?Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? What side effects can be expected?Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? If so, who is sponsoring the trial?Will the therapy be covered by health insurance? Further information on evaluating CAM therapies and practitioners is available from NCCAM.What federal agencies can provide more information about CAM therapies?Patients, their families, and their health care providers can learn about CAM therapies from the following government agencies and resources:NCCAMNCCAM is the federal government's lead agency for scientific research on CAM. NCCAM is dedicated to exploring complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science, training CAM researchers, and disseminating authoritative information to the public and professionals. The NCCAM Clearinghouse provides information on NCCAM and on CAM, including fact sheets, other publications, and searches of federal databases of scientific and medical literature.

OverviewQuestions and Answers About the Gerson TherapyChanges to This Summary (09/23/2010)Evaluation of CAM ApproachesQuestions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMTo Learn More About CAMTop of page OverviewThe Gerson therapy is a complex regimen that has been used to treat people with cancer and other diseases (see Question 1).The key parts of the Gerson therapy are a strict diet, dietary supplements, and enemas (see Question 1).The theory is that disease can be cured by removing toxins from the body, boosting the immune system, and replacing excess salt in the body's cells with potassium (see Question 3).The Gerson therapy requires that the many details of its treatment plan be followed exactly (see Question 4).
Few clinical studies of the Gerson therapy have been published (see Question 6).Taking too many enemas of any kind can be harmful (see Question 7)The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved the Gerson therapy for the treatment of cancer or other diseases (see Question 8).Cancer patients should talk with their health care providers about an appropriate diet to follow (see Question 8).Top of page Questions and Answers About the Gerson TherapyWhat is the Gerson therapy?The Gerson therapy has been used by some people to treat cancer and other diseases. It is based on the role of minerals, enzymes, and other dietary factors.
There are 3 key parts to the therapy:Diet: Organic fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to give the body plenty of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and other nutrients. The fruits and vegetables are low in sodium (salt) and high in potassium.Supplementation: The addition of certain substances to the diet to help correct cell metabolism (the chemical changes that take place in a cell to make energy and basic materials needed for the body's life processes).Detoxification: Treatments, including enemas, to remove toxic (harmful) substances from the body.What is the history of the discovery and use of the Gerson therapy as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer?The Gerson therapy was named after Dr. Max B. Gerson (1881-1959), who first used it to treat his migraine headaches. In the 1930's, Dr. Gerson's therapy became known to the public as a treatment for a type of tuberculosis (TB). The Gerson therapy was later used to treat other conditions, including cancer. What is the theory behind the claim that the Gerson therapy is useful in treating cancer?The Gerson therapy is based on the idea that cancer develops when there are changes in cell metabolism because of the buildup of toxic substances in the body. Dr. Gerson said the disease process makes more toxins and the liver becomes overworked. According to Dr. Gerson, people with cancer also have too much sodium and too little potassium in the cells in their bodies, which causes tissue damage and weakened organs. The goal of the Gerson therapy is to restore the body to health by repairing the liver and returning the metabolism to its normal state. According to Dr. Gerson, this can be done by removing toxins from the body and building up the immune system with diet and supplements. The enemas are said to widen the bile ducts of the liver so toxins can be released. According to Dr. Gerson, the liver is further overworked as the treatment regimen breaks down cancer cells and rids the body of toxins. Pancreatic enzymes are given to decrease the demands on the weakened liver and pancreas to make enzymes for digestion. An organic diet and nutritional supplements are used to boost the immune system and support the body as the regimen cleans the body of toxins. Foods low in sodium and high in potassium are said to help correct the tissue damage caused by having too much sodium in the cells.How is the Gerson therapy administered?The Gerson therapy requires that the many details of its treatment plan be followed exactly.
Some key parts of the regimen include the following: Drinking 13 glasses of juice a day. The juice must be freshly made from organic fruits and vegetables and be taken once every hour. Eating vegetarian meals of organically grown fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Taking a number of supplements, including:Potassium.Lugol's Solution (potassium iodide, iodine, and water).Coenzyme Q10 injected with vitamin B12. (The original regimen used crude liver extract instead of coenzyme Q10.)Vitamins A, C, and B3 (niacin).Flaxseed oil.Pancreatic enzymes.Pepsin (a stomach enzyme). Taking coffee or chamomile enemas regularly to remove toxins from the body. Preparing food without salt, spices, or oils, and without using aluminum cookware or utensils.Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using the Gerson therapy?No results of laboratory or animal studies have been published in scientific journals. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of the Gerson therapy been conducted?Most of the published information on the use of the Gerson therapy reports on retrospective studies (reviews of past cases). Dr. Gerson published case histories (detailed reports of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of individual patients) of 50 of his patients. He treated several different types of cancer in his practice. The reports include Dr. Gerson's notes, with some X-rays of the patients over time. The follow-up was contact with patients by mail or phone and included anecdotal reports (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment histories of one or more patients).In 1947 and 1959, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed
the cases of a total of 60 patients treated by Dr. Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit.The following studies of the Gerson therapy were published:In 1983-1984, a retrospective study of 38 patients treated with the Gerson therapy was done. Medical records were not available to the authors of the study; information came from patient interviews. These case reviews did not provide information that supports the usefulness of the Gerson therapy for treating cancer. In 1990, a study of a diet regimen similar to the Gerson therapy was done in Austria. The patients received standard treatment along with the special diet. The authors of the study reported that the diet appeared to help patients live longer than usual and have fewer side effects. The authors said it needed further study.In 1995, the Gerson Research Organization did a retrospective study of their melanoma patients who were treated with the Gerson therapy. The study reported that patients who had stage III or stage IV melanoma lived longer than usual for patients with these stages of melanoma. There have been no clinical trials that support the findings of this retrospective study. A case review of 6 patients with metastatic cancer who used the Gerson therapy reported that the regimen helped patients in some ways, both physically and psychologically. Based on these results, the reviewers recommended that clinical trials of the Gerson therapy be conducted.Have any side effects or risks been reported from use of the Gerson therapy?Reports of three deaths that may be related to coffee enemas have been published. Taking too many enemas of any kind can cause changes in normal blood chemistry, chemicals that occur naturally in the body and keep the muscles, heart, and other organs working properly.
Is the Gerson therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?The Gerson therapy has not been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for cancer or any other disease.For most cancer patients, nutrition guidelines include eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products. However, general guidelines such as these may have to be changed to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Patients should talk with their health care providers about an appropriate diet to follow. Information about diet during cancer treatment is also available from the Cancer Information Service (1-800-4-CANCER [TTY: 1-800-332-8615]) and in the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care.Top of page Changes to This Summary (09/23/2010)The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
new information becomes available. This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above.Editorial changes were made to this summary.
Top of page Evaluation of CAM ApproachesIt is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.
Top of page Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMWhen considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected?What are the risks associated with this therapy?Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?What benefits can be expected from this therapy?Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?If so, who is sponsoring the trial?Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

Overview
Acupuncture applies needles, heat, pressure, and other treatments to one or more places on the skin known as acupuncture points (see Question 1).
Acupuncture has been used in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years as part of traditional Chinese medicine (see Question 2).
Acupuncture has been used in the United States for about 200 years (see Question 2).
Acupuncture is used to treat many illnesses and ailments; however, it is mainly used to control pain, including cancer pain, and to help control nausea and vomiting. (see Question 2).
There is strong evidence from clinical trials that acupuncture relieves nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (see Question 7).
Acupuncture may work by causing physical responses in nerve cells, the pituitary gland, and parts of the brain (see Question 4).
Laboratory and animal studies of acupuncture for cancer treatment suggest acupuncture can reduce vomiting caused by chemotherapy and may help a person's immune system work better (see Question 6).
The most acupuncture research on cancer has been done in China (see Question 7).
Most acupuncture research with cancer patients studies the use of acupuncture to relieve symptoms caused by cancer treatment (see Question 7).
It is important that acupuncture treatment be given by a qualified practitioner who uses a new set of disposable (single-use) needles for each patient (see Question 8 ).

Questions and Answers About Acupuncture What is acupuncture? Acupuncture applies needles, heat, pressure, and other treatments to certain places on the skin to cause a change in the physical functions of the body. The use of acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). TCM is a medical system that has been used for thousands of years to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along a network of paths, called meridians. Qi is said to affect a person’s spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical condition. According to TCM, qi has two forces, yin and yang. Yin and yang are opposite forces that work together to form a whole. The forces of yin and yang depend on each other and are made from each other in an unending cycle, such as hot and cold, day and night, and health and disease. Nothing is ever all yin or all yang, both exist in all things, including people. Many of the major organs of the body are believed to be yin-yang pairs that must be in balance to be healthy. When a person's yin and yang are not in balance, qi can become blocked. Blocked qi causes pain, illness, or other health problems. TCM uses acupuncture, diet, herbal therapy, meditation, physical exercise, and massage to restore health by unblocking qi and correcting the balance of yin and yang within the person.Most acupuncturists in the United States practice acupuncture according to the traditions of Chinese medicine. However, there are other types of acupuncture, including some used for medical treatment, that have different theories about meridians and acupoint locations.What is the history of the discovery and use of acupuncture as a
complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?The oldest medical book known, written in China 4000 years ago, describes the use of acupuncture to treat medical problems. The use of the treatment spread to other Asian countries and to other regions of the world, including to Europe by the 1700s. In the United States, acupuncture has been used for about 200 years.Research on acupuncture began in the United States in 1976. Twenty years later, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the acupuncture needle as a medical device. Many illnesses are treated with acupuncture, but it is used mainly to control pain, including pain in cancer patients and to help control nausea and vomiting. Its primary use in cancer patients has been as an addition to conventional (standard) therapy.What is the theory behind the claim that acupuncture is useful in treating cancer?According to TCM, qi can be unblocked by using acupuncture at certain places on the skin, called acupoints. Acupoints are places where the meridians come to the surface of the body. There are more than 2,000 acupoints on the human body, with specific acupoints for each condition being treated.What physical effects may acupuncture have when used in cancer patients?Acupuncture may cause physical responses in nerve cells, the pituitary gland, and parts of the brain. These responses can cause the body to release proteins, hormones, and brain chemicals that control a number of body functions. It is proposed that, in this way, acupuncture affects blood pressure and body temperature, boosts immune system activity, and causes the body's natural painkillers, such as endorphins, to be released.How is acupuncture administered?The acupuncture method most well-known uses needles. Disposable, stainless steel needles that are slightly thicker than a human hair are inserted into the skin at acupoints. The acupuncture practitioner determines the correct acupoints to use for the problem being treated. The inserted needles may be twirled, moved up and down at different speeds and depths, heated, or charged with a weak electric current. There are other acupuncture methods that do not use needles. Some acupuncture techniques include the following:Electroacupuncture: A procedure in which pulses of weak electrical current are sent through acupuncture needles into acupoints in the skin.Trigger point acupuncture: The placing of acupuncture needles in a place on the skin that is away from the painful part of the body. Trigger points have to do with referred pain, pain that is not felt at the site of injury, but is sent along nerves and felt elsewhere in the body.Laser acupuncture: The use of a weak laser beam instead of an acupuncture needle to stimulate an acupoint.Acupuncture point injection: The use of a syringe and needle to inject drugs, vitamins, herbal extracts, or other fluids into the body at an acupoint.Microwave acupuncture: The use of a microwave device attached to an acupuncture needle to deliver microwave radiation to an acupoint.Acupressure: A type of massage therapy in which the fingers are used to press on an acupoint. In cancer patients, acupressure has been used to control symptoms such as pain or nausea and vomiting.Moxibustion: A type of heat therapy in which an herb is burned above the body to warm a meridian at an acupoint and increase the flow of blood and qi. The herb may be placed directly on the skin, held close to the skin for several minutes, or placed on the tip of an acupuncture needle. Cupping: A procedure in which a rounded glass cup is warmed and placed upside down over an area of the body, making a vacuum that holds the cup to the skin. Cupping is used to increase the flow of blood and qi. It is believed to open up the skin’s pores and allow toxins to leave the body.
Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using
acupuncture?
Scientific studies on the use of acupuncture to treat cancer and side effects of cancer began only recently. Laboratory and animal studies suggest that acupuncture can reduce vomiting caused by chemotherapy and may help the immune system be stronger during chemotherapy. Animal studies support the use of electroacupuncture to relieve cancer pain. Laboratory and animal studies have also looked at how acupuncture works for cancer treatment, such as the role of acupuncture in stimulating immune functions, including increasing blood cell count and enhancing lymphocyte and natural killer cell activity. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of acupuncture been conducted? Most studies of the use of acupuncture in cancer patients have been done in China. In 1997, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began evaluating the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture as a complementary and alternative therapy. Studies of the effect of acupuncture on the immune systemHuman studies on the effect of acupuncture have shown that it changes immune system response.Studies of the effect of acupuncture on painIn clinical studies, acupuncture reduced the amount of pain in some cancer patients. In one study, most of the patients treated with acupuncture were able to stop taking drugs for pain relief or to take smaller doses. The findings from these studies are not considered strong, however, because of weaknesses in study design and size. Studies using strict scientific methods are needed to prove how acupuncture affects pain.
Studies of the effect of acupuncture on muscle and joint pain from aromatase inhibitorsAromatase inhibitors, a type of hormone therapy for postmenopausal women who have hormone-dependent breast cancer, may cause muscle and joint pain. A randomized study found that true acupuncture was much more effective in relieving joint pain and stiffness than sham (inactive) acupuncture in patients taking aromatase inhibitors.Studies of the effect of acupuncture on nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy The strongest evidence of the effect of acupuncture has come from clinical trials on the use of acupuncture to relieve nausea and vomiting. Several types of clinical trials using different acupuncture methods showed acupuncture reduced nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, surgery, and morning sickness. It appears to be more effective in preventing vomiting than in reducing nausea.A study of acupuncture, vitamin B6 injections, or both for nausea and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy for ovarian cancer found that acupuncture and vitamin B6 together gave more relief from vomiting than acupuncture or vitamin B6 alone.A study was made of acupressure for relief of nausea and vomiting in women undergoing chemotherapy. The study found that acupressure applied to an acupuncture point with a wristband helped to decrease nausea and vomiting and reduced the amount of medicine the women used for those symptoms.Studies of the effect of acupuncture on hot flashes in patients treated for cancer Hormone therapy may cause hot flashes in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer. Some studies have shown that acupuncture may be effective in relieving hot flashes in these patients.Study of the effect of acupuncture on fatigue in patients treated for cancerA randomized study of patients with cancer-related fatigue found that those who had a series of acupuncture treatments had less fatigue compared to those who had acupressure or sham acupressure treatments.Studies of the effect of acupuncture on cancer symptoms (other than nausea) and side effects of cancer treatmentThe aim of most acupuncture clinical observation and clinical trials in cancer patients has been to study the effects of acupuncture on cancer symptoms and side effects caused by cancer treatment, including weight loss, cough, coughing up blood, anxiety, depression, dry mouth, proctitis, speech problems, blocked esophagus, hiccups, and fluid in the arms or legs. Studies have shown that, for many patients, treatment with acupuncture either relieves symptoms or keeps them from getting worse.Have any side effects or risks been reported from acupuncture?There have been few complications reported. Problems are caused by using needles that are not sterile (free of germs) and from placing the needle in the wrong place, movement of the patient, or a defect in the needle. Problems include soreness and pain during treatment; feeling tired, lightheaded, or sleepy; and infections. Because chemotherapy and radiation therapy weaken the body's immune system, a strict clean needle method must be used when acupuncture treatment is given to cancer patients. It is important to seek treatment from a qualified acupuncture practitioner who uses a new set of disposable (single-use) needles for each patient.
Is acupuncture approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?The FDA approved acupuncture needles for use by licensed practitioners in 1996. The FDA requires that sterile, nontoxic needles be used and that they be labeled for single use by qualified practitioners only.More than 40 states and the District of Columbia have laws regulating acupuncture practice (see www.acufinder.com for an online database of licensed acupuncture providers). The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (www.nccaom.org) certifies practitioners of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Most states require this certification.[Back to Top]

General CAM Information
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.
Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.
Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.
[Back to Top]
Evaluation of CAM Approaches
It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer.
Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.
The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.

Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM
When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:
What side effects can be expected?
What are the risks associated with this therapy?
Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?
Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
If so, who is sponsoring the trial?
Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

Overview
Mistletoe is a plant that grows on several types of common trees such as apple, oak, and elm, and has been used since ancient times to treat many ailments (see Question 1).
Mistletoe is one of the most widely studied complementary and alternative medicine therapies in people with cancer. In certain European countries, products made from European mistletoe are among the most prescribed therapies for patients with cancer (see Question 1).
Mistletoe extract has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory and to affect the immune system. However, there is no evidence that mistletoe's effects on the immune system help the body fight cancer (see Question 2 and Question 3).
Mistletoe extracts are usually given by injection under the skin or, less often, into a vein, into the pleural cavity, or into the tumor. (see Question 4).
Animal studies have suggested that mistletoe may be useful in decreasing the side effects of standard anticancer therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation (see Question 5).
More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see Question 6).
Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see Question 7).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see Question 8).
The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for clinical research (see Question 8).
Questions and Answers About Mistletoe Top
What is mistletoe?
Mistletoe is a semiparasitic plant that grows on several types of trees, including apple, oak, maple, elm, pine, and birch. It has been used for centuries to treat medical conditions such as epilepsy, hypertension, headaches, menopausal symptoms, infertility, arthritis, and rheumatism.
Mistletoe is one of the most widely studied complementary and alternative medicine therapies for cancer. In certain European countries, products made from European mistletoe are among the most prescribed therapies for cancer patients. These products are made and sold under brand names including:
Iscador (also called Iscar).
Eurixor.
Helixor.
Isorel (also called Vysorel).
Iscucin.
Lektinol (also called Plenosol).
ABNOBAviscum.
This summary discusses research done mainly with this mistletoe species.
The chemical makeup of mistletoe products varies, depending on many factors, including:
The type of host tree on which the mistletoe plant grows.
The time of year the plant is harvested.
The species of mistletoe.
Whether the extract is fermented or unfermented.
Whether the extract is prepared with homeopathic methods.
The company that makes the product.
Mistletoe extracts are prepared as water-based solutions or solutions of water and alcohol. Mistletoe products may be named according to the type of host tree on which the plant grows. For example, IscadorM is from apple trees, IscadorP comes from pine trees, IscadorQ is from oak trees, and IscadorU comes from elm trees. Some users believe that the type of mistletoe extract chosen should depend on the type of tumor and the sex of the patient.
What is the history of the discovery and use of mistletoe as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer?
Mistletoe was used by the Druids and the ancient Greeks, and appears in legend and folklore as a panacea or ""cure-all"". Modern interest in mistletoe as a possible treatment for cancer began in the 1920s.
Extracts of mistletoe have been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory and to boost the immune system (the complex group of organs and cells that defends the body against infection or disease). For this reason, mistletoe has been classified as a type of biological response modifier (a substance that stimulates the body's response to infection and disease). Extracts of mistletoe have also been shown in the laboratory to prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.
Ingredients in mistletoe that have been studied for their usefulness in treating cancer include:
Alkaloids.
Viscotoxins.
Lectins.
What is the theory behind the claim that mistletoe is useful in treating cancer?
Mistletoe extract is studied as a possible anticancer agent because it has been shown to:
Have effects on the immune system.
Kill mouse, rat, and human cancer cells in the laboratory.
Protect the DNA in white blood cells in the laboratory, including cells that have been exposed to DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs.
There is no evidence that mistletoe's effects on the immune system help the body fight cancer.
See the PDQ health professional summary on Mistletoe Extracts for more information on theory.
How is mistletoe administered?
Mistletoe extracts are usually given by injection under the skin (subcutaneous). Less common ways to give mistletoe include by mouth, into a vein (intravenous or IV), into the pleural cavity, or into the tumor. In most reported studies, injections under the skin were given 2 to 3 times a week for various lengths of time.
What preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies have been conducted using mistletoe?
Many laboratory and animal studies have been done with mistletoe, either alone or combined with other agents. Laboratory studies have suggested that mistletoe may support the immune system
by increasing the number and activity of various types of white blood cells. One type of European mistletoe (IscadorQu) used in a 2004 laboratory study showed a strong anticancer effect on certain types of cancer cells but no anticancer effect on other types of cancer cells. While one laboratory study reported that mistletoe extract caused several types of human cancer cells to grow faster, this was not found in other recent lab studies.
Studies testing mistletoe's ability to stop cancer cell growth in animals have yielded mixed and inconsistent results, depending on the extract used, the dose tested, the way it was given, and the type of cancer studied. Results of a few animal studies have suggested that mistletoe may be useful in decreasing the side effects of standard anticancer therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and that it counteracts the effects of drugs used to suppress the immune system, such as cortisone.
Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using
mistletoe?
Most clinical trials using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done in Europe. Most study results have been published in German. Although many of these trials have reported mistletoe to be effective, there are major weaknesses in almost all that raise doubts about their findings. Weaknesses have included small numbers of patients, incomplete patient data, lack of information about mistletoe dose, and problems with study design.
Many studies involve using mistletoe as adjuvant therapy in patients with cancer. One retrospective cohort study done between 1993 and 2000 looked at the use of a mistletoe extract (Iscador) as long-term adjuvant therapy in 800 patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for colorectal cancer that had not spread. The study found that patients treated with Iscador had fewer adverse events, better symptom relief, and improved disease-free survival compared to patients who did not receive Iscador as adjuvant therapy.
In 2002, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), began enrolling patients for a phase I clinical trial of a mistletoe extract (Helixor A) and gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial is now closed and the data is being analyzed.
Before researchers can conduct clinical drug research in the United States, they must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA does not make information public about IND applications or approvals; this information can be made public only by the applicants. At present, at least two U.S. investigators have IND approval to study mistletoe as a treatment for cancer.
The National Cancer Institute's PDQ clinical trials database contains protocol abstracts for clinical studies of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer.
Have any side effects or risks been reported from mistletoe?
Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract products. Common side effects include soreness and inflammation at injection sites, headache, fever, and chills. A few cases of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.
Although mistletoe extracts appear to be safe, mistletoe plants and berries are toxic (poisonous) to humans. Side effects caused by eating mistletoe plants and berries include seizures, slowing of the heart rate, abnormal blood pressure, vomiting, and death. These toxic effects may be more or less severe depending on the amount and the type of mistletoe plant eaten.
Is mistletoe approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe extracts to be imported or used except for clinical research.
At this time, there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer except in carefully designed clinical trials. These trials will give more information about whether mistletoe can be useful in treating certain types of cancer.

Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.
The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.
Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM Top
When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:
What side effects can be expected?
What are the risks associated with this therapy?
Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?
Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
If so, who is sponsoring the trial?
Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

Ref. No.
FLA-99-09
Dear
Mr Arjona:
This letter is in reference to your firm's marketing and distribution of ""vitamin B-17"" tablets and ""Apricot Seeds"". Promotional material (labeling) makes therapeutic claims which cause the products to be drugs as defined in section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). Examples of the claims for these products include:
flour purpose is to assist anyone in the world in obtaining the adequate amount of vitamin B-17 to treat their existing cancer"";
""…evidence that cancer is a nutritional-deficiency disease … caused by … the absence of … Vitamin B-17 … the cure and prevention of cancer is simple … This concept is not approved by orthodox medicine. Yet the evidence is clear that here, at last, is the final answer to the cancer riddle."";
""World Without Cancer, Inc., with great satisfaction, is able to present a vegetable agent whose anti-tumor action was known empirically for many years … This anti-tumor agent is Vitamin B-17 (commonly known as Amygdalin or Laetrile)."";
""Vitamin B-17 and information about it has been banned from most of the US over 15 years ago"";
""Amygdalin — Vitamin B-17"": ""…the ultimate cancer treatment""; and,
""These seeds [Apricot seeds] have the highest content of B-17 on earth … The seeds may be used in combination with the Laetrile cancer therapy"".
These products are ""new drugs"" [section 201(p) of the Act] because there is no evidence that they are generally recognized as safe and effective for their intended uses. Therefore, they may not be marketed in the United States without approved New Drug Applications [section 505(a) of the Act].
Laetrile continues to be the subject of Import Alert No. 62-01 and continues to be considered an unapproved new drug. In addition, Laetrile is not eligible for importation under the provisions of personal importation.
These drugs are also misbranded [section 502 of the Act] because the labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. The labeling is false and misleading as it suggests that the products are safe and effective for their intended uses when, in fact, this has not been established.
This letter is not intended to be an all inclusive review of all labeling and products your firm markets. It is your responsibility to ensure that all products marketed by your firm are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations.
We are also aware that you are marketing the following products with objectionable claims:
""Amygdalin (Vitamin B-17) — injectable form"": claims include ""Laetrile in Mexico is administered through injection … We carry the injectable form in 3 gram ampules.""
Shark cartilage"": claims include Irnot only is this a nontoxic product recommended for the treatment of cancer, but also for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism and osteoarthritis""
""Preven-Ca"": claims include ""this product is designed to inhibit tumor growth…""
""Kenzyme Tabs"": claims include ""…antineoplastic effect of pancreatic enzymes…""; and,
""Ester-C"": claims include ""low levels of ascorbic acid may be associated with higher risks of cancer, heart disease, and macular degeneration…"".
In addition, the ""World Without Cancer"" video is promoted as ""perfect to give someone who has developed cancer or someone who wants to prevent cancer as it sums everything up"" and the ""World Without Cancer"" book is promoted as ""evidence that cancer is a deficiency disease."" This book and video establish the intended uses for the products ""Apricot Seeds"", ""vitamin B-17 tablets"", and ""Amygdalin (Vitamin B-17) — injectable form"" in the treatment and prevention of cancer. The continued marketing of the products with the promotional materials and the objectionable claims may cause them to be violative drugs.
We request that you take prompt action to correct these violations. Failure to promptly correct violations may result in enforcement action being initiated by the Food and Drug Administration without further notice. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides for the seizure of illegal products and for injunction against the manufacturer and/or distributor of illegal products.
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct the stated violations. You should also include an explanation of each step being taken to identify and make corrections to assure that similar violations will not recur. If corrective action cannot be completed within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which the corrections will be implemented.
Your reply should be sent to Martin E. Katz, Compliance Officer, Florida District, Food and Drug Administration, 555 Winderley Pl #200, Maitland, FL 32751, telephone 407-475-4729.
Sincerely,
/s/

}Alternatives
So,
how did the conventional treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma fare with
respect to the four requirements, set in the very beginning, that
would justify legal enforcement, against the will of
children/adolescents diagnosed with the disease and their parents? Here's the short summary:
1. Does it have nearly 100% success rate?
NO
2.
Does limited delay of this particular treatment generally involves serious health risk?
NO
3. Is it nearly free from dangerous side effects?
NO
4. Is it the only viable alternative?
NO
Now that we have unveiled the true face of ""cure"" for Hodgkin's
offered by the conventional medicine, can we blame parents for
trying to use non-invasive alternatives first?
That is all that Danny Hauser and his
parents - as well as Katie Wernecke and her parents,
Abraham Cherrix
and his parents, and many others - asked for. For that, the parents
have been labeled by the government to be neglectful, unfit to take
care of their own children.
Are there alternative, non-invasive therapies for Hodgkin's
disease that can actually work? Certainly. Mind you, Hodgkin's does
not result from the body being deficient in highly toxic chemicals
and/or deadly radiation. It has its physiological/environmental causes and, as with any
other disease in general - and cancers in particular - the key for a
true cure lies in the body itself.
Hoxsey herbal formula alone, while helpful in strengthening the
immune system, probably wouldn't do it for most Hodgkin's patients. When
combined with nutritious, organic diet - which is originally part of
it - it does become significant healing force. More so with added detox
routine. But there are alsio other
cancer-fighting forces among non-invasive therapeutic options. Here are some of
them.
Laetrile, also called Amygdalin and vitamin B17, is a natural
non-toxic substance belonging to the large family of plant
substances known as nitrilosides. Common source are apricot
kernels, but many other edible
plants have high
nitriloside content. Their complex molecules are made
of hydrogen cyanide, a benzene ring or acetone, and sugar. In the
intestine, it is broken by the bacterial/fungal enzyme β-glucosidase into
hydrogen cyanide, benzaldehyde or acetone, and sugar (cancer cells
themselves produce high levels of β-glucosidase enzyme, as opposed
to the normal cells which hardly produce any).
Hydrogen
cyanide is highly cytotoxic, but readily neutralized in the normal
cell by the rhodonase enzyme. Cancer cells, typically low in
rhodonase, are left exposed to hydrogen cyanide's toxicity.
Similarly, benzaldehyde's strong cytotoxicity is quickly neutralized
by oxidation into non-toxic benzoic acid in the oxygen-rich
environment of the normal cell, but not so in the oxygen-depleted
cancer cell. Synergistic toxic effect of these two compounds on the
cancer cell
exceeds that of any chemotherapy agent,
yet to the rest
of the body laetrile is only 1/20 as toxic as aspirin.
How did conventional medicine manage to get around such a
cancer-fighting commodity? Easily. In the clinical trial at Mayo
Clinic in the early 1980s, sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute, they used laetrile as racemic mixture,
having only 1/10 the strength of its levo-rotary form. Even so,
some improvement did show, but the trial was
terminated, proclaiming laetrile ineffective. Case closed.
As a result, most of clinical applications of laetrile in the
U.S. (some states do allow its use in officially terminal cases, on
patient's request; also, it is legal in Europe, and used regularly
by Dr. Ernesto Contreras at his clinic in Tijuana, Mexico) have
taken place before 1980s, and were limited in size.
One of them was on a group of 10 patients with inoperable
metastatic cancers, by Dr. John A. Morrone, M.D.,
Attending Surgeon at the Jersey City Medical Center, New Jersey, in
1962. Three of these patients were diagnosed with Hodgkin's; here's
how they responded to laetrile therapy, as reported by Dr. Morrone (Chemotherapy
of inoperable cancer,
Preliminary report of 10 cases treated with laetrile):
Case 5. R.F., age 20, male, single, premedical student,
weight 200 lb., height 59 in., blood pressure 114/70 mm. Diagnosis:
malignant lymphoma, type Hodgkin's. Condition started as enlarged
cervical gland, diagnosis on biopsy. Urinalysis negative, hemoglobin
11 Gm./100cc.
Deep X-ray therapy was employed. The patient complained of
weakness, dizziness, and pain in the axillae and groin. The
cervical, axillary and inguinal glands were palpably enlarged. The
conjunctivae and sclerae were pale and icteric.
Laetrile 1 Gm. was injected intravenously. In ten minutes the
systolic blood pressure dropped 6 mm. but there were no other
apparent effects. Four days later the patient reported that he felt
more active, had a better appetite, and had suffered no ill-effects.
An injection of Laetrile 1Gm. was repeated. The systolic blood
pressure dropped 4 mm. in ten minutes, no other apparent effects.
In a period of four and a half months he received nineteen
injections of Laetrile, five of 1 Gm. and fourteen of 2 Gm.
During the period of medication the pains in the neck and groin
ceased and the adenopathy disappeared. The patient felt euphoric and
his general appearance was considerably improved. There were no
apparent adverse effects from the injections. The blood picture
improved after Laetrile therapy.
Case 7. G.P., age 21, male, single, college student, weight
149 lb., height 70 in., blood pressure 110/70 mm. Diagnosis:
malignant lymphoma, Hodgkins type. Urinalysis and hematology
negative.
A growing mass in front of the right ear, which returned four
years after its initial appearance and recession, was removed and
found to contain multinucleated giant cells typical of Hodgkin's
disease. There was a hard, tender, enlarged lymph node in the mid-sternocleidomastoid
region measuring 3x2cm. Urinalysis and liematology were negative.
Laetrile 1 Gm. was injected intravenously. The systolic blood
pressure dropped 4 mm. but there were no apparent side-effects.
Three days later the enlarged gland was smaller, softer, and less
painful. By the sixth day all pain had ceased.
In a period of four months he received twenty-seven injections of
Laetrile, ten of 1Gm. and seventeen of 2 Gm. There were no
side-effects. One injection, made directly into the tumor mass, was
followed by itching and local tenderness.
During the period of treatment the patient returned to college.
Pain was absent, appetite good, weight increased 13 lb., and his
appearance was excellent. The blood picture improved under Laetrile
therapy.
Case 10. F.F- Age 17, male, single, student. weight 140 lb.,
height 71 in., blood pressure 110/70. Diagnosis: Hodgkin's disease,
granuloma type, with metastasis to the thorax.
During the last three months a growing mass in the left
supraclavicular region had reached the size of a quarter sphere of
an average orange. The patient complained of pain in both axillae,
weakness, nausea and anorexia. He had lost 25lb. and was jaundiced.
Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The axillary lymph glands were
enlarged, especially on the right side. The roentgenograms showed
progressive nodal enlargement inside the thorax.
Laetrile 1 Gm. was injected intravenously. In five minutes the
systolic blood pressure dropped 6 mm. but there were no apparent
other effects.
On examination two days later the mass in the neck was softer and
smaller. By the fifth day it was reduced to about half the original
size, and was softer and movable. The axillary lymph glands were
barely palpable. He was free from pain and his appetite had
returned.
In a period of five months he received thirty-six injections of
Laetrile, nineteen of 1 Gm. and seventeen of 2 Gm. There were no
side-effects.
During the period of treatment there was no pain and no
enlargement of the supraclavicular mass occurred. Appetite improved
and the patient gained 24 lb. He returned to his studies. Comparison
of before and after hemograms showed distinct improvement in the red
blood cell count and hemoglobin.
All 10 patients had similar positive response, resulting in
partial or full cancer remission. Coincidence? Make your own
conclusion.
Another natural compound with similar, selectively toxic effect
targeting cancer cells is the common mineral
cesium. Being strong alkalizer, cesium is attracted to typically acidic cancer cells.
Readily absorbed through their potassium channels, cesium lowers
their acidity level; when the typical cancer cell pH of 6.5 drops to
7 (neutral), the cell stops growing; as it turns alkaline, with pH
exceeding 7, cancer cell begins to die.
One of the ""side effects"" of
cesium being very unhealthy for cancer cells is its very efficient
suppression of pain caused by cancer, even in terminal cases. As
with laetrile, their direct side effects are mild and rare; however,
their efficiency can over-saturate the body with toxins created by
dying and decomposing cancer cells, thus requiring simultaneous
detox routine (which is very desirable for cancer patients in
general, regardless of treatment type).
As a side note, this secondary toxicity is very likely the main cause of the
mysterious retinoic acid syndrome, potentially
life-threatening complications following remission of acute
promyelocytic leukemia as a result of treatment with non-toxic
vitamin A derivative, which has demonstrated efficacy making it an
alternative to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Is it really so hard for the conventional medical doctors to
comprehend
how critically important
is to help the body detoxify
when treating any cancer?
These non-toxic anti-cancer agents are illustration and proof
that treatments based on toxicity selectively targeting cancer calls,
while sparing good cells, are
possible and available. They are possible for the simple reason that
cancer cell has different, anaerobic
(sugar/fermentation based, pretty much as in plant - specifically
yeast - cell) metabolism, as opposed to aerobic (oxygen-based) metabolism of
normal cells. One of the consequences is the above mentioned
difference in the level of β-glucosidase and rhodonase enzymes in
the cancerous vs. healthy cell.
This basic distinction of the cancerous cell has been known since 1925, when it was discovered by Nobel Prize
laureate Dr. Otto Warburg.
But the official medicine won't switch to the non-toxic treatment
direction unless
supplied by a superior (to laetrile and/or cesium) pharmacological
agent, produced by pharmaceutical industry,
so that it can be
patented, get a high-price tag and
make big profits.
Simply using
natural (unpatentable), inexpensive agents already available is a
no-no practice that would lead to a profit collapse for the pharmaceutical
industry, and loss of the dominant position in the field of medical
services by the American Medical Association (i.e. conventional,
allopathic medicine). For them,
sticking to their guns
is literally ""to be or not to be"".
There are also other non-invasive treatments with proven
ability to fight cancer: Budwig diet, macrobiotics, chelation therapy, ozone
therapy, pulsed magnetic field therapy, enzyme therapy, colonic
cleansing/enemas, positive imagery, vitamin/mineral mega doses, and
others. But they are being ignored or ridiculed by the official medicine
for the reason just stated above.
Why is it that the conventional medicine never even contemplated
having ""combined modality"" clinical trials with these effective, but
non-invasive treatments? The simple answer is: there's no money in
it, and that's not ""their thing"".
The ""no money"" part is what primarily concerns the pharmaceutical
industry - the mighty power that has created and controls much of
what the conventional medicine is today. It had also so effectively
infiltrated the overseeing government's agency, FDA, that whatever
positive comes from its existence results more from it
preventing pharmaceutical industry from self-destructing
due to excessive greed,
than from its genuine concern for the wellbeing of the American people.
The ""not their thing"" part is what concerns AMA (American Medical
Association), which wants to keep its official and practical
monopoly in the area of medical services by proclaiming its medical practices to
be the only proper way of doing medicine. Since these practices are
mainly created by the pharmaceutical industry so that they sell its
products - drugs, radiation and surgery aids -
the two are
tied together ""till death do us part"".
Considering this, it is no wonder that so much money and research
has been put into minimizing toxicity of inherently highly toxic
conventional treatments for Hodgkin's, as well as into building a picture of
deception that it is not only a ""cure"", but also the only option
available,
and so little in non-invasive natural alternatives. It is no wonder
that researching the actual causes of Hodgkin's - immune deficiency,
Epstein-Barr virus link, genetic predisposition, environmental
toxins, etc. - is lagging behind for decades.
There's no money in it, and it ain't their thing.
Sadly, the entire cause-oriented medicine is sidetracked and
officially downgraded to ""unproven"" or ""experimental"" at best,
simply because suppressing symptoms with patented drugs and
expensive surgeries is where the big profits lie. Addressing the
causes, most of which originate in the environment and unhealthy
lifestyle, would not only drastically reduce the profit, but would
also dwarf the size of the patient market.
It would, inevitably,
also expose, and financially hurt those who don't wont you to know
that their smokestacks, littering of the environment, toxic
chemicals, processed foods or electromagnetic fields are harming
your health.
Aside the enormous influence that these multibillion dollar
businesses have, the government becomes
even more sympathetic when the economic growth is at stake. All this
is
what the drug-free and
cause-oriented medicine is up against.
After this little digression that helps understand why the things
are the way they are, we can finally conclude this lengthy
discourse, and answer the question:
Does the government, under the pretext of child protection,
have the right to force Americans bellow 18 years of age to undergo
conventional Hodgkin's treatment against their and will of their
parents?
It does not.
There is no guarantee that child will survive;
depending on the severity of the disease, the chances that it won't
be alive after 5 years are between 1 in 20 and 1 in 3
(approximately). If child dies within this period, the most likely cause is
Hodgkin's. Longer-term, the chances of premature death - about 2 in
3 within 30 years after the treatment - and morbidity - nearly 100%
chance of suffering chronic diseases - make the conventional
Hodgkin's treatment
all but safe and bullet-proof.
One could argue that this is still better than no treatment, in
which case nearly all patients would die within 10 years. But ""no
treatment"" is not what Wernecke, Cherrix, Hauser and other families
wanted. They wanted to give a chance to less invasive, or
non-invasive treatments first, to spare their child from
excruciating, dehumanizing ordeal of the conventional Hodgkin's
treatment, which still retains very real, significant risks.
What the government is doing by criminalizing the parents for
this, and forcing their children to undergo toxic conventional
therapy, is not child protection. It is protection of self-serving
medicine abducted by profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies and
political ambitions of American Medical Association, determined to
dominate the field of medical services.
There is no right way to do wrong. If the government wants to get
involved and help the children diagnosed by Hodgkin's - and other
life-threatening diseases - it can only do so by giving fair,
factual advice to parents who want best to their children about all
treatment alternatives, and
let them make their choice.
It can only
have the right to step in and enforce treatment when parents, by any
reasonable measure, fail to act. But it cannot allow those who have
vested interest from practicing particular treatment - or, for that
matter, particular kind of medicine - to decide for the parents what
is their only choice.
And, this cannot be overemphasized: cancer is too serious and
complex disease to allow anyone without necessary medical training
to decide about the particulars of child's treatment - including its
parents. Guidance of a competent medical professional is essential.

714-X (PDQ®)
Topics in This SectionOverviewQuestions and Answers About 714-XChanges To This Summary (06/10/2009)General CAM InformationEvaluation of CAM ApproachesQuestions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMTo Learn More About CAM
Overview
The main ingredient of 714-X is camphor, which comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree (see Question 1).
It is claimed that 714-X helps the immune system fight cancer (see Question 3).
No study of 714-X has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal to show it is safe or effective in treating cancer (see Question 6).
714-X is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States (see Question 8).
Questions and Answers About 714-X Top
What is 714-X?
714-X is a chemical compound that contains camphor, a natural substance that comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree. Nitrogen, water, and salts are added to camphor to make 714-X.
What is the history of the discovery and use of 714-X as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?
714-X was developed in the 1960s in Canada, where it is still being made. Patients in Canada can get 714-X only from a doctor, for compassionate use (giving a treatment to patients before it is approved, because they have a life-threatening disease and there is no drug or other therapy to treat the disease). 714-X is used in Mexico and some western European countries. It is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States (see Question 8).
What is the theory behind the claim that 714-X is useful in treating cancer?
The development of 714-X was based on the theory that there are tiny living things in the blood called somatids. According to this theory, some types of somatids are found only in the blood of people who have cancer or other serious diseases. These types of somatids are said to make growth hormones that cause cells to grow without control. The makers of 714-X state that by looking at the number and type of somatids in the blood, doctors can see if cancer is starting to form or can diagnose cancer and predict where the cancer will spread.
The theory states that cancer cells trap nitrogen needed by normal cells and make a toxic substance that weakens the immune system. 714-X is reported to help the body fight cancer cells in these ways:
The camphor in 714-X is said to prevent cancer cells from taking nitrogen from the body's normal cells.
714-X is also said to help the immune system by increasing the flow of lymph, the colorless fluid that travels through the body carrying white blood cells that help fight infection and disease.
Some research studies are published in scientific journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence. No studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the theory of somatids in the development of cancer. Research on the use of 714-X as a cancer treatment is discussed in Question 5 and Question 6.
How is 714-X administered?
714-X is usually given by injection near the lymph nodes in the groin. In some patients with lung or oral cancer, 714-X can be sprayed into the nose using a nebulizer (a device that turns liquid into a fine spray). The makers of 714-X do not recommend injecting it into a vein (intravenously) or taking it by mouth.
The makers of 714-X suggest the following:
714-X is more effective if given early in the disease, before chemotherapy or radiation therapy is begun.
714-X can be used along with conventional treatments.
Vitamin B12 supplements, vitamin E supplements, shark cartilage, and alcohol should not be used during treatment with 714-X.
Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using 714-X?
Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a drug, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Animal tumor models are used to learn how a cancer may progress and to test new treatments. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun.
No laboratory studies of the safety and/or effectiveness of 714-X have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. A few animal experiments have been done, but the results of these experiments have not been reported in scientific journals. The animal studies used a lymphosarcoma tumor model in rats and lymphoma tumor models in dogs and cows. 714-X was not found to be effective against cancer in these studies.
Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of 714-X been conducted?
No clinical trials or other studies with cancer patients have been published in
peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the safety or effectiveness of 714-X. A number of anecdotal reports (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment history of one or more patients) and testimonials (personal reports from people who claim to have been helped or cured by the product) have been published in newspapers and other nonmedical literature.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed the records of some cancer patients who used 714-X. This review was done to decide if NCI should begin a clinical trial of the product. Not enough information was available to support recommending a trial. See the notice on the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine Web site.
Have any side effects or risks been reported from 714-X?
The makers of 714-X claim that it is not harmful to humans. The reported side effects of treatment with 714-X are redness, tenderness, and swelling at the injection site.
Is 714-X approved by the FDA as a cancer treatment in the United States?
The FDA has not approved 714-X for use in the United States.

General CAM Information Top
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.
Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.
Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.
Evaluation of CAM Approaches Top
It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer.
Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.
The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.
Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM Top
When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:
What side effects can be expected?
What are the risks associated with this therapy?
Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?
Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
If so, who is sponsoring the trial?
Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

Overview
Acupuncture applies needles, heat, pressure, and other treatments to one or more places on the skin known as acupuncture points (see Question 1).
Acupuncture has been used in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years as part of traditional Chinese medicine (see Question 2).
Acupuncture has been used in the United States for about 200 years (see Question 2).
Acupuncture is used to treat many illnesses and ailments; however, it is mainly used to control pain, including cancer pain (see Question 2).
Acupuncture may work by causing physical responses in nerve cells, the pituitary gland, and parts of the brain (see Question 3).
Laboratory and animal studies of acupuncture for cancer treatment suggest acupuncture can reduce vomiting caused by chemotherapy and may help a person's immune system work better (see Question 5).
The most acupuncture research on cancer has been done in China (see Question 6).
Most acupuncture research with cancer patients studies the use of acupuncture to relieve symptoms caused by cancer treatment (see Question 6).
There is strong evidence from clinical trials that acupuncture relieves nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (see Question 6).
It is important that acupuncture treatment be given by a qualified practitioner who uses a new set of disposable (single-use) needles for each patient (see Question 7).
Questions and Answers About Acupuncture Top
What is acupuncture?
Acupuncture applies needles, heat, pressure, and other treatments to certain places on the skin to cause a change in the physical functions of the body. The use of acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). TCM is a medical system that has been used for thousands of years to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease.
Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along a network of paths, called meridians. Qi is said to affect a person’s spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical condition. According to TCM, qi has two forces, yin and yang. Yin and yang are opposite forces that work together to form a whole. The forces of yin and yang depend on each other and are made from each other in an unending cycle, such as hot and cold, day and night, and health and disease. Nothing is ever all yin or all yang, both exist in all things, including people. Many of the major organs of the body are believed to be yin-yang pairs that must be in balance to be healthy. When a person's yin and yang are not in balance, qi can become blocked. Blocked qi causes pain, illness, or other health problems. TCM uses acupuncture, diet, herbal therapy, meditation, physical exercise, and massage to restore health by unblocking qi and correcting the balance of yin and yang within the person.
According to TCM, qi can be unblocked by using acupuncture at certain places on the skin, called acupoints. Acupoints are places where the meridians come to the surface of the body. There are more than 2,000 acupoints on the human body, with specific acupoints for each condition being treated.
Most acupuncturists in the United States practice acupuncture according to the traditions of Chinese medicine. However, there are other types of acupuncture, including some used for medical treatment, that have different theories about meridians and acupoint locations.
What is the history of the discovery and use of acupuncture as a
complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?
The oldest medical book known, written in China 4000 years ago, describes the use of acupuncture to treat medical problems. The use of the treatment spread to other Asian countries and to other regions of the world, including to Europe by the 1700s. In the United States, acupuncture has been used for about 200 years.
Research on acupuncture began in the United States in 1976. Twenty years later, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the acupuncture needle as a medical device. Many illnesses are treated with acupuncture, but it is used mainly to control pain, including pain in cancer patients. Its primary use in cancer patients has been as an addition to conventional (standard) therapy.
What is the theory behind the claim that acupuncture is useful in treating cancer?
Acupuncture may cause physical responses in nerves cells, the pituitary gland, and parts of the brain. These responses can cause the body to release proteins, hormones, and brain chemicals that control a number of body functions. It is proposed that, by these actions, acupuncture affects blood pressure and body temperature, boosts immune system activity, and causes the body's natural painkillers, such as endorphins, to be released.
How is acupuncture administered?
The acupuncture method most well-known uses needles. Disposable, stainless steel needles that are slightly thicker than a human hair are inserted into the skin at acupoints. The acupuncture practitioner determines the correct acupoints to use for the problem being treated. The inserted needles may be twirled, moved up and down at different speeds and depths, heated, or charged with a weak electric current. There are other acupuncture methods that do not use needles.
Some acupuncture techniques include the following:
Electroacupuncture: A procedure in which pulses of weak electrical current are sent through acupuncture needles into acupoints in the skin.
Trigger point acupuncture: The placing of acupuncture needles in a place on the skin that is away from the painful part of the body. Trigger points have to do with referred pain, pain that is not felt at the site of injury, but is sent along nerves and felt elsewhere in the body.
Laser acupuncture: The use of a weak laser beam instead of an acupuncture needle to stimulate an acupoint.
Acupuncture point injection: The use of a syringe and needle to inject drugs, vitamins, herbal extracts, or other fluids into the body at an acupoint.
Microwave acupuncture: The use of a microwave device attached to an acupuncture needle to deliver microwave radiation to an acupoint.
Acupressure: A type of massage therapy in which the fingers are used to press on an acupoint. In cancer patients, acupressure has been used to control symptoms such as pain or nausea and vomiting.
Moxibustion: A type of heat therapy in which an herb is burned above the body to warm a meridian at an acupoint and increase the flow of blood and qi. The herb may be placed directly on the skin, held close to the skin for several minutes, or placed on the tip of an acupuncture needle.
Cupping: A procedure in which a rounded glass cup is warmed and placed upside down over an area of the body, making a vacuum that holds the cup to the skin. Cupping is used to increase the flow of blood and qi. It is believed to open up the skin’s pores and allow toxins to leave the body.
Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using
acupuncture?
Scientific studies on the use of acupuncture to treat cancer and side effects of cancer began only recently. Laboratory and animal studies suggest that acupuncture can reduce vomiting caused by chemotherapy and may help the immune system be stronger during chemotherapy. Animal studies support the use of electroacupuncture to relieve cancer pain.
Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of acupuncture been conducted?
Most studies of the use of acupuncture in cancer patients have been done in China. In 1997, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began evaluating the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture as a complementary and alternative therapy.
Studies of the effect of acupuncture on the immune system
Human studies on the effect of acupuncture on the immune system of cancer patients showed that it improved immune system response.
Studies of the effect of acupuncture on pain
In clinical studies, acupuncture reduced the amount of pain in some cancer patients. In one study, most of the patients treated with acupuncture were able to stop taking drugs for pain relief or to take smaller doses. The findings from these studies are not considered strong, however, because of weaknesses in study design and size. Studies using strict scientific methods are needed to prove how acupuncture affects pain.
Studies of the effect of acupuncture on nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy
The strongest evidence of the effect of acupuncture has come from clinical trials on the use of acupuncture to relieve nausea and vomiting. Several types of clinical trials using different acupuncture methods showed acupuncture reduced nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, surgery, and morning sickness. It appears to be more effective in preventing vomiting than in reducing nausea.
Studies of the effect of acupuncture on cancer and symptoms (other than nausea) caused by cancer treatment
Clinical trials are studying the effects of acupuncture on cancer and symptoms caused by cancer treatment, including weight loss, cough, chest pain, fever, anxiety, depression, night sweats, hot flashes, dry mouth, speech problems, and fluid in the arms or legs. Studies have shown that, for many patients, treatment with acupuncture either relieves symptoms or keeps them from getting worse.
Have any side effects or risks been reported from acupuncture?
There have been few complications reported. Problems are caused by using needles that are not sterile (free of germs) and from placing the needle in the wrong place, movement of the patient, or a defect in the needle. Problems include soreness and pain during treatment; feeling tired, lightheaded, or sleepy; and infections. Because chemotherapy and radiation therapy weaken the body's immune system, a strict clean needle method must be used when acupuncture treatment is given to cancer patients. It is important to seek treatment from a qualified acupuncture practitioner who uses a new set of disposable (single-use) needles for each patient.
Is acupuncture approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?
The FDA approved acupuncture needles for use by licensed practitioners in 1996. The FDA requires that sterile, nontoxic needles be used and that they be labeled for single use by qualified practitioners only.
More than 40 states and the District of Columbia have laws regulating acupuncture practice (see www.acufinder.com for an online database of licensed acupuncture providers). The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (www.nccaom.org) certifies practitioners of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Most states require this certification.

Apricots
Apricots abricot (French), Aprikose (German), Marille (Austrian), albicocca (Italian), albaricoque (Spanish), albercoc (Catalan), alperces/damasco (a variety with softer flesh)(Portuguese), arbeletcheko (Basque), abrikoos (Dutch), abrikos (Danish/Swedish/Norwegian), aprikoosi (Finnish), abrikos (Russian), morela (Polish), kajszibarack (Hungarian), kajsija/marelica (Serbo-Croat), caisa (Romanian), kajsiya/zarzala (Bulgarian), prikokkia (Greek), kayisi/zerdali (wild apricot)(Turkish), mishmish (Hebrew/Arabic), zardalu (Persian), zard alu/khoomani (dried)(Hindi), xing (Chinese), anzu (Japanese), aberikos (Indonesian)
(Prunus armeniaca -- Family Rosaceae)
Apricots are members of the rose family and closely related to the plum, peach, cherry, and almond. The Greeks wrongly supposed the fruit to have originated in Armenia, and called it the Armenian plum/apple, and hence its botanical name (armeniaca). The Romans were impressed by its early ripening and called it praecocium, meaning precocious. Like peaches and plums, apricots are drupes, that is, a stone fruit that develops from self-pollinating white flowers. The fruits are roundish, yellow-orange in colour, with its length somewhat flattened and having a ""seam"" that runs around it almost dividing it into halves. The skins are fuzzy and velvety, flushed with pink. The flesh is firm, sweet and fragrant, but contains little juice. Apricots do not ripen after being picked. They only soften, so the flavour never improves if picked green and allowed to sit. The kernel is edible, but care must be taken not to consume more than one or two because of the prussic acid. These kernels are used mainly to flavour jams and are put into the jars whole, and discarded later.
Apricots grew wild for thousands of years in China, where it was first cultivated. While no word for the apricot exists in either Hebrew or Sanskrit, a Chinese character designating it appeared in written form just prior to 2000 BCE. Chinese silk traders introduced the fruit to Persia and Armenia. Alexander the Great is credited with taking the apricot to Southern Europe and introducing it to Greece in the 4th century BCE. Pliny mentions that apricot cultivation began among the Romans about 100 BCE and were prized by them, as well as with the Greeks who called them ""golden eggs of the sun"". By the 16th century CE, apricots were successfully cultivated in Northern Europe, including a wild variety mentioned growing in Siberia. King Henry VIII's gardener brought the apricot to England from Italy in 1542; but the real growing success was achieved by Lord Anson at Moor Park in Hertfordshire, producing the European favourite called Moor Park.
The Spanish brought the apricot to the New World, first planting it in Mexico, and later, in their California missions. The English attempted to grow apricots in the eastern US, but they did not fare well. Today, apricots are extensively cultivated in California, Israel, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Spain, and Russian central Asia. To some extent, they are also grown in Canada. Unfortunately, as with many fruits, those grown in North American have far less flavour than those grown in the Near East, where climate, soil conditions, and chemical-free growing produces a more flavourful fruit. In addition, since apricots do not travel and do not ripen after picking, they are sold green. Consequently the flavor is very disappointing. Since apricots ripen early, they require certain climatic conditions, mainly a fairly cold winter and moderately high temperatures in the spring and early summer. Such conditions are found in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, where the apricot just manages to ripen in their limited amount of sunshine. The main regions of cultivation include a band stretching from Turkey through Iran and the Himalayas to China and Japan; southern Europe and North Africa; South Africa; Australia; and California.
Apricots' diversity is found in their many colours, particularly in the great apricot belt from Turkey to Turkestan. These colours can be white, black, gray, and pink. Flavours are equally varied as are the sizes, which can range from that of a pea to that of a peach. In the Near East, white apricots are common and have pale skin with pinkish blushing and a translucent flesh. It is a supreme delicacy cherished for its sweetness. The range of colour does not affect the flavour, but it does affect the carotene content. The deeper the colour, the more Vitamin A it contains, as well as more Vitamins C and E and potassium.
Dried apricots are especially rich in carotenes, which are the natural yellow pigments that the body uses to make Vitamin A. According to the American Cancer Society, apricots, and other foods rich in carotenes, may lower the risk of cancers of the larynx, esphagus, and lungs. Apricots also provide potassium, iron, calcium, silicon, phosphorus, and Vitamin C. The copper and cobalt in apricots is beneficial in treating anemia, but should be used cautiously during pregnancy and in cases of diarrhea. In some animal studies, dried apricots were just as effective as liver, kidneys, or eggs in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia. Apricots are good potassium-replacers for those on diuretics, but there is some debate among nutritionists whether the form of potassium found in apricots (potassium gluconate) is as easily absorbed by the body as such other forms as potassium citrate or potassium chloride.
Overall, dried apricots have a far greater nutritional value than the fresh ones because all the nutrients are concentrated. When apricots are cooked, the pectin is dissolved, softening the fruit. The colour does not change nor does the Vitamin A content as carotenes are impervious to heat. Dried fruit is expensive because it takes five pounds of fresh apricots to produces only one pound of dried; and, since drying removes only the water, the nutrient qualties remain relatively the same. Ounce for ounce, dried apricots, compared to the fresh, have twelve times the iron, seven times the fiber, and five times the Vitamin A. It is interesting to note that both the fresh and dried apricot are a main food staple of a tiny Hunza principality in the Himalayas, who are known for their extreme longevity, excellent health, and an almost exclusive vegetarian diet.
Despite the health aspects of the fruit, it does contain some harmful substances that, if used improperly, can undo all their healthy benefits. The bark, leaves, and inner pit all contain amygdalin, a natural chemical that can breaks down into several components, including hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid) in the stomach. Apricot oil is specially treated during processing to remove the cyanide and is marked FFPA to show that it is free from prussic acid. Apricot pits are another story. Extracts of the pits are known as Laetrile and used as a cancer treatment. These extracts go through a process that allows the human body to benefit from the substance, whereas, eating them raw renders them useless to the human body and only makes them poisonous (see under B vitamins). There have been reports of fatal poisoning from consuming too many of the raw pits. The theory behind the Laetrile treatments is that the cyanide in amygdalin is released only when it comes in contact with beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme common to tumor cells, and that it does not affect healthy cells. However, this theory has had no controlled testing done to prove its validity. In addition, apricots are often treated with sulfur dioxide before being sun dried. This bleaches the fruit, which then has to be recoloured with dye. Organically grown apricots have a superior flavour when fresh, although their appearance is less appealing when dried; but they are not subjected to any bleaching or colouring. Those that have not been treated with this preservative become darker in colour, with a carmelized, almost fig-like flavour. However, sulfur dioxide has caused some allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock in people sensitive to sulfites.
Apricots are so versatile that they can be eaten raw or cooked, dried, canned, or frozen, and served in countless ways in sweet or savory dishes. Turkey also produces an apricot leather, which is dried apricot flesh in the form of thin sheets. This is melted down for use in cooking or taken on journeys to eat as is. In South Africa, an unusual preserve called meebos is made from ripe, but firm, apricots which are brined, stoned, pressed flat, salted, and dried in the sun for several days. The resulting sheets of fruit are kept for months stored in jars between layers of sugar. Although hardly nutritious, since about the 7th century in China, apricots were preserved by salting and even smoking. The black smoked apricots of Hupei were famous. In the Middle East, apricots are used in sweetmeats or stoned and stuffed with almonds or almond paste. Because the almond and the apricot are related, the flavour of the two compliments each other. The kernels of apricots taste very similar to almonds and roasting them renders the prussic acid harmless. Used in such savoury dishes as pilafs of the Middle East, apricots add a special sweetness. The Italian ""amaretti di Saronno"" is a cross between a biscuit and a macaroon and owes its flavour and texture to apricot kernels and not almonds.
Some interesting apricot hybrids have appeared. The Chinese and Japanese have cultivated a flowering species (Armeniaca mume, formerly Prunus mume). It is often misdescribed as a type of plum. but the small and sour fruits are salted or pickled. Many Japanese believe that they should be eaten first thing in the morning to cleanse the system. The 'black apricots' (Armeniaca x dasycarpa) of northern India look like purplish-black plums, but have a true apricot flavour. California has developed a few plum-apricot hybrids, bearing such names as plumcot and aprium. It should be noted that the South American apricot or San Domingo apricot are not true apricots, but are fruits also known as mamy (mammee).

”Crops have higher yields when more [carbon dioxide] is available... But there's a trade-off between quantity and quality. While crops may be more productive, the resulting produce will be of lower nutritional value.”
Peter S. Curtis, ecologist at Ohio State University, linking escalating
greenhouse gas levels (and resulting crop yield increases)
to a decrease in the nutritional value of these crops
General, Pros and Cons & Background
Rising atmospheric CO2 decreases micronutrients in plants world-wide
Copyright © 2004 Healing Cancer Naturally
An October 2002 report (Rising atmospheric CO2 and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry? by Irakli Loladze, Ph.D., Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) discusses the effects of rising CO2 (ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration) on human nutrition.
The atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased since pre-industrial times, altering the chemical composition of plants - the fundamental food source for humanity, with the data showing that overall concentrations of microelements in plants decline when atmospheric CO2 rises. One example of many: a new report by Fangmeier et al. (2002) based on a large study of the second most important crop in Europe (potato), shows an overall decline in the concentrations of almost all measured essential elements in both foliage and tubers under elevated CO2 conditions.
In other words, rising CO2 aggravates 'hidden hunger' - apparently the leading nutritional disorder in the world. Since increasing atmospheric CO2 affects all plants world-wide, this decrease in nutrients would apply to both conventionally grown mass-produced crops and to organically grown foods (which otherwise are consistently superior in both taste, nutritive content and mineral balance), and simultaneously invalidate the often-heard claim that a well-balanced diet renders supplementation superfluous.
The above-described “CO2 effect” adds its detrimental influence to that of an “agriculture which robs our daily food of over 60 natural and crucially vital trace elements without which we sicken and die - and as if this were not enough - an agriculture which then adds its poisons to our daily food, to the air we breathe, to the water we drink, and to the soil in which we grow our crops.” The final result? A world where more and more people fall prey to all manner of disease including cancer. Read an eye-opening article on conventional husbandry and rising cancer incidence.
Dr. Bodo Kuklinski, director of the renowned Diagnostic & Therapeutic Centre for Environmental Medicine in Rostock, Germany, has arrived at a similar conclusion but attributes the decrease in nutrition of foodstuffs uniquely to industrialized farming methods and mass production leading to dramatic decreases in vitamin and mineral content. He found that even those eating a normally varied diet are chronically undersupplied with vital nutrients and ""starving in the midst of abundance"". The European Centre for Immunotherapy and Immunological Research (private clinic Obertal in Beiersbronn, Germany) for instance ascertained that the calcium content of potatoes decreased by 70 percent (from 14 milligramm per 100 grams to 4 mg) between 1985 and 1996. The vitamin C content of spinach dwindled by more than half while bananas showed a whopping 93 percent decrease in essential vitamin B6 (which, among other things, strengthens mental concentration and the immune system).
Karen Vago confirms in ""Protégez votre corps"": “Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based fertilizers make the plants grow so fast that they have no time to store a sufficient amount of minerals. They can't draw from the soil their share of zinc, manganese, chromium, selenium and magnesium. If allowed to grow 'naturally', they are able to accumulate the substances vital for our cells and our whole organism.”

Research corroborates: a wholesome diet is more healing than taking isolated supplements
Research corroborates that eating nutrients as part of a wholesome diet and/or within a whole food is more health-promoting and cancer-fighting than taking the respective supplements in isolation. This is due to the synergistic effect various food nutrients display in the human body. See for instance

Quotes: ""’Our findings strongly suggest that risks of poor dietary habits cannot be reversed simply by taking a pill... We shouldn't expect easy solutions to complex problems. We must focus more on choosing a variety of healthy foods, exercising and watching our weight.’ ...The researchers also found that restricting the amount of food given to the rats cut their risk of developing prostate cancer - regardless of which diet they were on...Separate research has shown that higher levels of lycopene in the blood is linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer.""

Should I Take ""Supplements""?
excerpted from The Master Cleanser by Stanley Burroughs
Some people want to take vitamin pills or food supplements while on the [Master Cleanser lemonade detoxification] diet. This frequently fails to produce the desired result. There are many reasons. As the lymphatic glands become clogged, they are no longer able to assimilate and digest even the best of foods. As we cleanse our bodies and free our cells and glands of toxins that clog and paralyze our assimilation, we free our various organs and processes to do their proper jobs. Note earlier about all the necessary vitamins and minerals are in the lemonade, and therefore we do not need an additional supply in most cases.
Compare Edgar Cayce on Assimilation and Elimination.
Vitamin pills and supplements do not grow on trees as such but rather come to us in fruits, berries, vegetables and plants. Man will never take a group of natural or synthetic foods; process and combine them in a variety of products, and come up with anything equal or better than the original. They have lost much of their basic life and energy by combining them according to a man made concept. Many dangerous side effects can occur because of improper and unequal balances present. Stay with the natural laws of balance. First one must decide if God is right or if man is right. If God is right then man and his ideas of processing-tearing apart and rearranging-are likely to be wrong.
Later, as we consume a more complete variety of foods, we find our sources of vitamins and minerals complete and in forms that are easily assimilated-it should not be necessary to return to these supplements even if one is accustomed to taking them. The sources of good food are steadily being enlarged as people become more educated concerning them. Search these sources and rely on them for your total nutritional needs.
The lemon is a loosening and cleansing agent with many important building factors. The ability of the elements in the lemon and the maple syrup working together creates these desired results.
Its 49% potassium strengthens and energizes the heart, stimulates and builds the kidneys and adrenal glands.
Its oxygen builds vitality.
Its carbon acts as a motor stimulant.
Its hydrogen activates the sensory nervous system.
Its calcium strengthens and builds the lungs.
Its phosphorus knits the bones, stimulates and builds the brain for clearer thinking.
Its sodium encourages tissue building.
Its magnesium acts as a blood alkalizer.
Its iron builds the red corpuscles to rapidly correct the most common forms of anemia.
Its chlorine cleanses the blood plasma.
Its silicon aids the thyroid for deeper breathing.
The natural iron, copper, calcium, carbon, and hydrogen found in the sweetening supplies more building and cleansing material. It truly is a perfect combination for cleansing, eliminating, healing, and building. Hence, supplements are not needed during the diet and may actually interfere with its cleansing action.
What about the use of vitamins?
Vitamins and minerals have always been a necessary part of natural living. Not satisfied with God's plan, man has attempted to improve the situation by separating them from fresh live foods, then processing and combining them to conform to his concept of what they should be. Not satisfied with the finished product, attempts were made to produce them synthetically. It was big business-and we became a world of ""pill pushers,"" whether they were needed or not. More often they were not needed. No one really knew if the pills were needed, or how many-people just took them because they might have a deficiency!
Just how these vitamins and minerals should be balanced and formulated led to many differences of opinion. A large variety of experts, in processing and manufacturing of pills, disagree as to how the many billions of pills should be made. They all have different formulas and claim theirs are the best even though much is lost in the processing. However, even without any clear consensus as to their worth and use, they were manufactured and processed; therefore they must be sold with no thought as to possible side effects from overdosing or imbalances. Millions of dollars are made by the producers and the sellers with little regard for the true needs of the consumer.
In reality, the whole process could have been completely avoided. Our Creator has already done a better job of making sure we receive all the needed vitamins and minerals in a perfectly balanced form. Only the finest of natural foods in their original package are good enough for bringing complete energy and life to build and retain a healthy body. Any time man attempts to improve on God's formulas and plans, the result is bound to be a failure.
The simple rules to complete nutrition include all the vitamins and minerals needed by all mankind and all animals. Our Creator has given the right food for the right animal for complete nutrition. This is also true for man. When these foods are properly prepared and eaten, there is nothing more that man can do to prepare a better food.
As we eat the correct foods without excesses, the body will produce ALL the needed vitamins. Foods grown properly, in complete, mineral-rich soil, will have all the minerals in them. Thus, we have no need for vitamin enriched foods, created synthetically by man, nor for extra minerals.
But see Rising atmospheric CO2 decreases micronutrients in plants world-wide.
All refined and devitalized foods must be completely eliminated from our diet. If refined and devitalized foods are eaten, then and only then does man have any need for additional supplements. Just how much and what combination, even with long and complicated tests,, will probably never be determined, so this form of unnatural nutrition will always be lacking. Such a plan is a very poor substitute for the right way.

Dr. Hulda Clark on Making Clean Vitamin D
excerpted from www.HuldaClark.net where it was formerly published
The pollution problem for vitamin D comes from the need to dilute it to the standard 400 units allowed by regulations, in such a way that the consumer knows how much they are getting. This can be done in an elaborate way or a simple way such as adding it to plain oil with flavor added. But oil is never ""plain"". It comes polluted with PCB, benzene and often antimony, an outright poison. It also is loaded with Ascaris eggs and other invisible filth. The flavoring is not simple either. It might have any or all the immune-destroyers. ... the vitamin D3 concentrate, as it comes from the manufacturer could have lead in it. ... Lead could come simply from the copper plumbing used in the manufacturing plant.
So you see how pollution and contamination at the very beginning of the preparation of a supplement could get amplified into a formidable problem at the end. The final product will carry every pollutant brought in from all the ingredients.

About Individual Supplements
Vitamin cocktail cuts cancer deaths
Supplement had a dramatic effect
An extensive study has revealed that a specific mega-dose (antioxidant) supplement group can dramatically reduce cancer risk. A total of 13,000 men and women took part in the seven year study, which found that regular use of a particular supplement group produced a 31% reduction in the risk of all cancers in men taking the antioxidants. The supplement group is: 6mg of beta-carotene, 120mg of vitamin C, 90mg of vitamin E, 100 micrograms of selenium, and 20 milligrams of zinc.
The findings “completely support recommendations for following a healthy diet, particularly one rich in fruit and vegetables which are major dietary sources of antioxidant vitamins and minerals, for all ages in life and for both sexes."" The “scientists agreed that vitamins and minerals were better obtained from fruit and vegetables. They wrote: 'There is reason to believe that the effect would be less than that of dietary sources of antioxidants, particularly fruit and vegetables, which provide other protective substances.'""

Vitamin C healing testimony
From files http://natural-oncology.org
When my teenage daughter Helen was hospitalized with ""terminal"" (stage 4B) Hodgkin's disease in 1974, I put her on 40 grains of vitamin C per day (526 mg/lb.). Her doctors were aghast: ""You'll kill her!"" ""Nonsense!"" I replied. She recovered quickly, and 24 years later is in vibrant good health. ... If vitamin C is used in large amounts, most experts suggest that buffered vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) should be used rather than ascorbic acid, since the acid form may be too acidic in multi-gram doses. Sodium ascorbate powder (1 level tsp. equals 4 grams) may be purchased inexpensively by the pound or the kilogram from the Wholesale Nutrition Company (1-800-325-2664) or from Bronson (1-800-610-4848).

Additional tips on using Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)
by Leonard (leonardleonard1 at earthlink.net)
I think the benefits (for people with cancer) of taking large amounts of vit. C far outweigh any harmful effects (such as the alleged acidification of the blood when taking more than a few grams per day). [Also], acidifying is NOT NECESSARILY harmful for cancer patients (Boik). According to Gonzalez, the ascorbic acid form of vit. C tends NOT to acidify sympathetic-dominant persons, which most cancer patients are. ... if you're not on a low-sodium diet, you can use sodium ascorbate (or perhaps mixed ascorbates in moderate amounts).
Buffered formulas sometimes contain way too much calcium if one wishes to take large doses of C. I would avoid calcium ascorbates, including Ester C.
If using small amounts, I would get food-based vit. C (Megafood or New Chapter). If using large amounts AND money is not an issue, I would use beet-derived (ideally BioImmune.com) vit. C; cancer cells reportedly don't develop a resistance to it (like they do to corn-derived vit. C). If money is an issue, I would take sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid. If using HUGE amounts, I would use sodium ascorbate.
Many practitioners recommend taking vit. C to bowel tolerance.
Vit. C is synergistic with beta-glucan.
Receiving IV drips of several dozen grams of vit. C can be powerfully cancer-healing.

Vitamin B 17 (Laetrile/Amygdalin/Nitrilosides)
by Leonard (leonardleonard1 at earthlink.net)
(Background article on Laetrile here)
“I've read ... about amygdalin/Laetrile [that] ""cancers of the lung, breast, colon, ovaries, stomach, esophagus, prostate, and the lymphomas, are much helped"" by Laetrile (Ernesto Contreras, Sr., M.D. cited in Diamond et al., 1997, pp. 126-127). I do NOT think it's especially effective with myeloma. The above comments refer to IV laetrile, not oral amygdalin, which is much less powerful. Its effectiveness appears to be greatly enhanced by taking it with proteolytic enzymes (particularly pancreatin) and vit. A. It's a powerful pain-reliever and also alleviates nausea and vomiting. Michael Schachter, M.D. and Douglas Brodie, M.D. have prescribed 500 mg taken 3 times a day or 3-5 apricot kernels 3 times a day (Diamond et al., 1997, pp. 78-79, 376). I heard it's best to take it with food, in several small dosages throughout the day (NOT one large dosage). The richest sources are the pits/seeds/kernels of apricot, peach, cherry, and (probably to a lesser extent) apple, and plum/prune.
Since they are (slightly) toxic when taken orally, I'd eat about 5 kernels (no more than that a one time) 3 or 4 times a day, but no more if I had cancer. Laetrile is powerfully effective in healing cancer (and is nontoxic) only when taken IV.
Sun-dried kernels and bitter almonds contain significant amygdalin (sweet almonds do not). Foods highest in amygdalin are wild blackberry, choke cherry, wild crabapple, cranberry, apple seeds, apricot seeds, cherry seed, nectarine seed, peach seed, plum seed, prune seed, bitter almond, broad beans, cassava, and alfalfa.
In conclusion, I think it's helpful but I would not make it a priority.
Addendum by Healing Cancer Naturally: Also compare the following testimonial from a former bladder cancer patient, now healed by a combination of “alternative” approaches, quote: “Two years ago I chewed upwards of 30 apricot kernels a day ... [but t]he months and months of heavy kernel use did nothing. This is not a condemnation of apricot kernels. [Not everything works for everyone all the time.]” Note that Healing Cancer Naturally has no details on the approaches this former bladder cancer patient used.
CAUTIONS
Do NOT exceed recommended dosage. ""Apricot kernels...although they have been widely used, they are potentially toxic taken orally (Moss, 1992, p. 367). Avoid eating large amounts of (sweet) almonds while taking amygdalin. Do NOT take megadoses of Vit. C while taking Laetrile/amygdalin (unless directed by practitioner), and do NOT use Laetrile/amygdalin at times of fever. Slight temperature, itching, or irritation at tumor site indicate healing.

Introduction
by Healing Cancer Naturally © 2004 & 2009
""There is a herb for every illness."" (German saying)
In fact there may be even much more than just one herb for every illness. In addition to many if not most vegetables and fruits, numerous herbs and plants have been (and continue to be) reported as having either specific cancer-healing benefits/components or to generally boost the body's ability to heal itself from a variety of conditions involving below-par health.
That said, a person well-versed in alternative cancer treatments commented on the use of herbs in cancer treatment (paraphrased) that he felt that while herbal cancer remedies used to be quite powerfully cancer-healing, with people and environment becoming increasingly polluted (and I would add, with soils becoming increasingly depleted), herbs overall had become less effective today. But this shouldn’t discourage anyone from using what can be a powerful healing modality - herbs!
Did you know that even a number of chemotherapy medications are derived from herbs? Vincristine and Vinblastine for instance are derived from the herb periwinkle, and Taxol is made from the bark of a specific tree.
There is a lot more money to be made once these herbs are chemically manipulated to become patentable while preserving some of the characteristics/effects of the herbal base and this is likely the reason why herbal preparations that have proven efficient with many people are either denounced or actively suppressed by the medical establishment. A graphic illustration among several: the history of the Hoxsey formula, known to be highly effective with many cancers and reportedly extremely effective with basal cell carcinoma (compare On Cancer Business).
Herbs and cancer
by Dr. Jürgen Buche
Text partially excerpted and adapted by Healing Cancer Naturally from Dr. Jürgen Buche’s former Preventorium site
Many claims have been made for marked anti-neoplastic action in certain plants (anti-neoplastic is a term that means that some blocking or inhibiting effect is shown against neoplasm, or new growth). Every healing tradition in the world has plants that have a reputation for being anti-cancer herbs. A research project in the United States is monitoring every flowering plant in the world (it will take some time) for cancer-inhibiting properties. Some of the ‘miracle drugs' used in the treatment of cancer by orthodox medicine were found in plants. The best example is the Madagascar Periwinkle, which is the source of the drug vinblastin and vincristine which are used in leukemia.
This is an example of the way herbs may be used specifically or as sources of active ingredients. Whilst not wanting to belittle the value of this approach, it is limited by the perception of cancer as a specific localized condition, which a specific drug (or herb) will counteract. It is far more appropriate to approach this condition as a manifestation of systemic disease, and use such systemic treatments as are appropriate in aiding the body to regain control. Herbs can be most effective in supporting this sort of bodily transformation through their cleansing, strengthening and healing properties. They work best when they are part of an approach to transformation - change in body, mind and spirit - which is possibly the only effective context in which to treat cancer.
Using the whole system approach we recommend alteratives and specific anti- neoplastic herbs as most relevant.
Alteratives
Through the cleansing and normalizing activity of the alteratives, herbs can support the process of the body ridding itself of cancerous growths. The remedies that work via the liver, augmenting its detoxifying activity, are especially useful. These include Burdock, Yellow Dock and many others. The kidneys’ important eliminative function is aided by Cleavers (part of the Kidney Cleansing Tea (kit)) and other herbs. Remedies that have specific tonic and cleansing action on the Lymphatic system are especially indicated in the herbal approach to cancer. Such herbs are Echinacea, Golden Seal etc. Consider the Preventorium's Tissue Cleansing Decoction.
Anti-neoplastics
To aid the body in reasserting order and structured organization in the affected tissue, we use plants that appear to have a specific action in inhibiting and combating the development of tumors. Many claims are made for different plants, some justified, some wishful thinking. We could give an exhaustive list culled from folk lore and old herbals, but while the action of some is certain, that of others is somewhat nebulous and uncertain. Those we list in the Tissue Cleansing Decoction (CCD) are in use in modern herbal therapeutics, especially in North America. The way in which these herbs work has not been fully analyzed from a scientific standpoint, but we know that they have a definite role to play in any herbal treatment of cancer.
In addition to specific anti-neoplastic plants, we should remember that, through aiding an organ or tissue with supportive and sustaining remedies, a renewal and release of 'vital energy' will move the affected part of the body to heal itself of the cancer. It may in fact be appropriate to use plants that are specific for that organ or suggested by the general state of health that have 'nothing' directly to do with cancer. For example, if there is a long history of lung infections, but the tumor is in the stomach, utilize tonics for both lungs and stomach. As explored throughout this treatise, healing comes from the life force of our own being and herbs can only facilitate this.
More on Herbs
If herbs or natural remedies are considered (and we trust that this is the case), then one can start with Garlic (traditionally a potent cancer preventive, blood cleanser and immune system stimulant), Ginseng and Cayenne as a stimulant, Chickweed is an excellent additional blood purifier.
A powerful diuretic and potent anti-cancer herb is Cleaver’s Herb which is part of our Kidney Cleansing Tea and the above-mentioned Tissue Cleansing Decoction (CCD).
Taheebo eliminates the pain associated with cancer and it multiplies red blood corpuscles. If pain persists, drink approximately 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. each of Lobelia and Ginseng powder in water.
A Garlic enema at the onset of pain will also bring relief. Another pain reliever is a poultice of one part Mullein and three parts Lobelia placed on the area of pain.
A Castor oil pack on the liver area will relieve the pain there. Make sure that you bring heat to the top surface by a hot water bottle or heating pad. Keep the pad in a refrigerator when not in use. A plastic pad will prevent soiling other things like the bed.
Golden Seal helps the hormonal balance, Rosehips is an excellent source of vitamins A, B, C, E, D, P, and Rutin. It helps dissipate infections and improves immunity function.
Devil's Claw and Chaparral help detoxify the lymph and blood. Certain Chinese herbs in special combinations will help considerably in the restoral and maintenance of the immune system.
There are others herbs as well. Each case should be discussed in detail in order to make an intelligent choice in order to help the task of detoxification.
Caution: NEVER MIX HERBS AND SYNTHETIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME!

Edgar Cayce’s advice: herbal cancer treatment
SARVAPISTI
Summary of www.cancercurative.org by Healing Cancer Naturally
The Indian D. S. RESEARCH CENTRE have cured thousands of cancer patients - even terminally advanced - with 'SARVAPISTI' - the “wonder medicine” for all types of cancer combining the nutrient energy extracted from 1621 human edibles. ""Nutrient Energy is the sole prescription of Nature for keeping up health, resisting unfavourable conditions of health and curing ailments. Our food is the reservoir of nutrient energy ... which strengthens the immune system and increases the power of resistance against unfavourable conditions that cause diseases and ailments.""
Convinced that a) cancer was basically a single disease despite its occurrence in different systems of the human organism, b) that the cause of cancer was extreme deviation in metabolism and c) that this deviation might be removed only with the help of nutrient energy, 'SARVAPISTI' has been developed and applied on terminally ill patients who had been sent back home by hospitals as being beyond the limits of any treatment, but not before destroying the patients' physical vitality and immune system by dangerous chemo drugs. Cancer of all forms and stages-acute leukaemia, liver cancer, gall bladder cancer, sarcoma of bones, astrocytoma of brain and other types of brain cancer, stomach, oesophagus and pancreas cancer and dangerously advanced metastatic cases-were cured. D. S. Research Centre‘s book CANCER IS CURABLE NOW contains evidential and scientific details of 111 cancer victors and vivid descriptions of the cancer curative 'Nutrient Energy Therapy' and other applications.

Finding the right modalities, foods and remedies for you
by Healing Cancer Naturally, © 2004 & 2006
As perhaps in all other areas of life, what is true for one isn’t always true for another, and what works for one won’t necessarily work for another. Life and the universe (as mentioned) aren’t just mostly empty space but for all that emptiness, also exceedingly complex :-)
Each individual seeking to heal from cancer (or any other illness, complaint or dis-ease) may react differently to a particular suggested practice. To find out in advance what will work for you, some recommend kinesiological muscle testing and/or dowsing (using a pendulum, see e.g. dowsers.org/lettertorobin) as a quick do-it-yourself method of determining which remedies, supplements, herbs, foods, modalities etc. are or would be positively or negatively affecting your body and health, i.e. are the right or wrong ones for you: “Based on solid science, [kinesiological muscle testing is used] to diagnose food allergies, geopathic and biophysical stress, interference fields, ... to detect stressed organs and structures, emotional blocks, heavy metal toxicity, dental problems, environmental toxicity and more.”
The more esoterically- and intuitively-minded and gifted may also find great value in working with their intuition, various divinatory cards (tarot etc.), dreams (such as asking/intending to receive clear answers to a question stated before falling asleep), and similar means of accessing hidden or inner knowledge, including asking for guidance from the invisible source of goodness, love and help you believe and trust in. (And I have seen various sources recommend to thank in advance for the right and best answer being given, and stress the importance of trust and belief.)
To requote Sandy L. (who is successfully healing herself of stage IV ovarian cancer, now seven years in remission) from the Welcome page, “I personally believe, instinctively that the 'cure' (whatever it is), is there [for] everyone of us, that perhaps it is not the same cure for everyone. I prefer to believe that the 'cure' is something attainable and available to everyone. I believe there are many. ‘Seek and Ye shall find.’ [emphasis by Healing Cancer Naturally]That is [also] why I believe in the Dr Johanna Budwig protocol, because it is natural, attainable and inexpensive. After my cancer diagnosis, I was acutely sensitized to a spiritual power who was somehow, in a way difficult to explain, helping me, guiding me and 'in my soul' (so to speak) showing me the path and leading me to my solutions for healing. People were sent to me and it was up to me to recognize this 'help in disguise'.”
For much inspiration and to learn about some of the various emotional/intuitive/mental/spiritual ways former cancer patients have used to heal themselves of cancer, see particularly Real-Life Healing Stories, Emotions & Cancer, Healing Cancer & Your Mind incl. The Subconscious Naysayer, Holistic-Energetic Healing Advice on Approaches, Methods & Modalities, Energetics and Spirituality & Cancer Healing. As to various techniques that can be used, some find value in DVDs providing hands-on how-to guidance on the subject of accessing inner knowledge and DIY healing tools, see Mind Power, Mental Influences, Illness & Healing: CDs and DVDs, Energy Healing & Energy Medicine DVDs and others.

Cancer Cells, Facts You Need to Know
Cancers form anywhere between ten and thirty years
before they are discovered.
Insulin stimulates cell growth. Cancer cells have six
to ten times more insulin receptors than normal cells. Studies show that high
insulin levels correlate with higher risks of developing cancer and lower rates
of survival amongst cancer patients.
Lower insulin levels may help prevent the
growth of cancer. Carbohydrate consumption stimulates insulin release. Protein
consumption stimulates insulin release too, to a lesser degree. Fat consumption
does not stimulate insulin release.
Sugar Feeds Cancer - Sugar and Cancer.
Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells have poor vascular systems and are deficient in oxygen, and that furthermore, when a normal cell was deprived of oxygen, it would become cancerous. The Respiratory Quotient (RQ) is a way of measuring how much oxygen you need to burn different types of fuels.
The RQ of different macronutrients is thus: Carbohydrate 0.7,
Protein 0.8, Fat 1.0. You require more oxygen to burn
carbohydrate than you do to burn fat. Anaemia
is caused by poor oxygen levels. Oxygen levels can be increased by supplying
the nutrients for making red blood cells: B12, folic acid, biotin, iron and
copper, all ""meat"" vitamins and minerals.
Cancer cells can produce forty times more lactic acid
than normal cells, implying they burn glucose in the absence of oxygen. This
type of fuel-conversion is known as ""fermentation"" and is typically
only used by very primitive life-forms such as bacteria, because it is
inefficient and produces very little energy in comparison to other
fuel-conversions.
This may be due to
defective mitochondria. Mitochondria are cell powerhouses that allow us to
burn fat for energy, they are a mark of our advanced
evolution: microbes do not have mitochondria and cannot burn fat.
Some cancer
scientists have theorised that cancer cells are ""throwback"" cells
which have forgotten they are a part of a pattern for a bigger organism. It
seems that cancer cells are not be able to burn fat
for energy. , therefore
cancer cells may be starved with a low-carbohydrate diet.
It has long been observed that cancer will
undergo spontaneous remission after a severe infection.
Cancer cells are more vulnerable to unusually high
body temperatures (fevers) than normal cells.
Cancer
cells produce both histamine and serotonin.
Cancer cells spread by using histamine to break down
collagen. Collagen is made from vitamin C, L-lysine and L-proline
(amino acids). Histamine is made from L-histidine
(another amino acid). Therefore increasing materials that supply collagen and
decreasing materials that supply histamine may restrict cancer cell growth.
Cancer cells produce up to 100 times more of an
enzyme, beta-glucosidase, than normal cells, certain
substances such as Laetrile, are broken down only in the presence of beta-glucosidase, thus providing a method targeting cancer
cells.
Cancer cells prevent immune attacks by surrounding
themselves in a protective coat of fibrin. Therefore fibrinolytics
(clot-busters) such as Dipyridamole
and Digitoxin may work as anti-cancer agents by breaking
down this protective coat. Streptokinase and nattokinase
also have a similar effect.
Nattokinase is available without prescription.
Cancer cells can only metastasize (spread) if the
blood can clot and form fibrin. Therefore prophylactic use of fibrinolytics may help to prevent the spread of an existing
cancer.
Cholesterol is a vital repair substance and the
precursor to many hormones including sex hormones. It is also the precursor to
vitamin D. Low
cholesterol increases the risk of cancer. This rarely publicised fact was
discovered and confirmed during numerous heart-disease prevention trials.
Results across many trials show consistent evidence that more total deaths occurred in subjects with low cholesterol, and frequently these deaths were from cancer. The lower the cholesterol, the poorer the
survival chances of those who are ill from any disease, including cancer.
Animal fat is composed of roughly equal quantities of
saturated and monounsaturated fat. Olive oil is composed largely of
monounsaturated fat. Saturated and monounsaturated fat consumption have never
been linked to cancer.
Despite numerous studies, only one study has every found
a connection between breast cancer and saturated fat, and this study was
quickly debunked
by numerous respectable medical sources, in fact a quick look at the
statistical evidence shows the study to be flawed. Unfortunately it is still
regularly quoted by the media and cancer charities (I consider this deeply
irresponsible).
Commercial vegetable oils are composed largely of
polyunsaturated fat. Margarine, vegetable shortening, and vegetable suets are composed of chemically altered vegetable oils
known as hydrogenated oils or trans-fats. Polyunsaturated
oils and hydrogenated oils are known carcinogens.
This fact was discovered
by accident in the seventies when a study aimed to aide the recovery of
hospitalised patients found those given a supplement of only 7% of energy as
polyunsaturated oil began to develop cancer. The statistics showed an increase
of around 15% from cancer deaths. These statistics were so shocking that the
study was called off on ethical grounds. Polyunsaturated
and hydrogenated fats cause cancer.
Cancer is an immune system disorder. The immune system
is suppressed by carbohydrate, linoleic acid
(polyunsaturated C18:2) and phytoestrogens (including
those found in soy aka soya
products). It is bolstered by certain saturated fats such as lauric acid
(C12:0, found in coconut oil) and stearic acid
(C18:0, the main component of hard beef and lamb tallow), and most fat-soluble
and water-soluble vitamins.
Full
spectrum sunlight and vitamin D extend the lives of cancer sufferers and
kill cancers in the laboratory.
People with poor thyroid function are particularly
vulnerable to cancer. If you regularly feel cold you may have poor thyroid
function. Most thyroid function is easy to correct: the biggest causes of poor
thyroid function are not eating enough calories, fat deficiencies, and vitamin
and mineral deficiencies.
Some Worthy Alternative Treatments
Coley's Toxins
Laetrile / Amygdalin / Sarcarcinase / Nitriloside / Vitamin B-17
Breuss, Gerson and Issels Cancer Treatments
Dr. Matthias Rath, Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and Cellular Therapy
Atkins was a Cancer Therapist
Sally Fallon and the Weston A. Price
Foundation
Coley's Toxins
Coley's Toxins
is a killed vaccine of the Streptococcus of Erysipelas and Serratia
Marcescens. It induces a fever and an immune reaction
in the patient.
The dramatic, even wondrous effects of Coley's are certainly
exciting to read about. Coley's has a long history of success going back to the
early years of the 20th century. A combination of deliberate hampering by
rivals and unfortunate legislation meant that Coley's Toxins were almost lost
to history, the ultimate blame lying with a cancer charity who failed to
sponsor the treatment for their own particular reasons.
Coley's is not used
commercially because it cannot be patented and therefore no drug company is
willing to throw money away on what is an extremely cheap, easy to produce
cancer treatment. More information: Coley's Toxins [PDF].
It has
been thought that Coley's works as a form of immunotherapy, or through the
L-arginine to nitric oxide pathway, however Joseph Thuo believes it may be a metabolic therapy:
that by raising the metabolic rate of the patient whilst simultaneously
starving the patient (and therefore the cancer) of nourishment, it causes a
rapid regression of the cancer.
""Since the main physiological effect of
starvation is the mobilization of fatty acids and the formation of ketone
bodies by the liver, it is very likely that reduced consumption of glucose and
increased utilization of fatty acids derivatives makes malignant cells very
susceptible to the increased metabolic rate that occurs during fever.""
Because
cancer, as we have learned, feeds off glucose, not fatty acids, and is
vulnerable to high body temperatures. This is certainly the most plausible
theory I have seen so far.
Laetrile / Amygdalin / Sarcarcinase / Nitriloside / Vitamin B-17
AKA Amygdalin, Sarcarcinase, Nitriloside, or vitamin B-17 is found in apricot kernels, greengage, plum, cherry and apple seeds, the seeds of other members of
the Rosaceae family, millet, linseed and bitter
cassava root (tropical manioc or tapioca).
Apricot kernels taste almost exactly
like almonds but with an additional bitter taste (not everyone can taste this).
The bitter taste is the Laetrile. Seven apricot kernels per day may be all you
need to protect yourself from cancer for life. Laetrile contains cyanide and benzaldehyde. It works like a targeted chemotherapy (unlike
regular chemotherapy, which is untargeted).
""The vitamin is harmless to healthy tissue for a
very simple reason: each molecule of B17 contains one unit of cyanide, one unit
of benzaldehyde and two of glucose (sugar) tightly
locked together.
In order for the cyanide to become dangerous it is first
necessary to 'unlock' the molecule to release it, a trick that can only be
performed by an enzyme called beta-glucosidase,
which is present all over the human body in minute quantities, but in truly
vast quantities (up to 100 times as high) at only one place: the site of a
malignant cancer tumor.
Thus the cyanide is unlocked only at the cancer site
with drastic results, which become utterly devastating to the cancer cells
because the benzaldehyde unit unlocks at the same
time.
Benzaldehyde is a deadly poison in its own
right, which then acts synergistically with the cyanide to produce a poison 100
times more deadly than either in isolation. The combined effect on the cancer
cells is best left to the imagination. But what about danger
to the rest of the body's cells?
Another enzyme, rhodanese,
always present in far larger quantities than the unlocking enzyme beta-glucosidase in healthy tissues, has the easy ability to
completely break down both cyanide and benzaldehyde
into beneficial body products. Predictably perhaps, malignant cancer cells
contain no rhodanese at all, leaving them completely
at the mercy of the two deadly poisons.""
More on Laetrile and benzaldehyde. Groves
says Laetrile works because of the hydrogen cyanide,
Moss says benzaldehyde works, even though it's
Laetrile without the hydrogen cyanide!
As we can see from the above quote, both
work but work better in a synergistic process involving both chemicals. Bitter
apricot kernels are available from numerous sources online. I regularly eat
bitter apricot kernels. I have yet to observe any ill effects, in spite of all
of the over-hyped official health warnings claiming I will fall down dead of
cyanide poisoning.
Breuss, Gerson and Issels Cancer Treatments
The Breuss
Total Cancer Treatment is based on what amounts to a 42 day fast
supplemented by multiple antioxidant and enzyme rich herbal teas and vegetable
juices. This is a whacky sounding treatment, but it does get results.
The
Austrian authorities once tried to sue Breuss for his
""dangerous diet"", but the case collapsed: Breuss's
lawyer, himself a cancer survivor cured by Breuss, trotted out a procession of patients attesting to
the healing powers of Breuss's diet. Breuss believed protein restriction was vital.
Gerson Therapy is strictly vegetarian and includes
supplements of B12 and liver extract to compensate. Here is a sample regimen:
Thirteen glasses of fresh, raw carrot/apple and
green-leaf juices prepared hourly from fresh, organic fruits and vegetables.
Three full vegetarian meals, freshly prepared from
organically grown fruits, vegetables and whole grains. A typical meal will
include salad, cooked vegetables, baked potatoes, vegetable soup and juice.
Fresh fruit and fresh fruit dessert available at all
hours for snacking, in addition to the regular diet.
Regular coffee enemas to detoxify the body.
Gerson and Breuss therapies have
popularised wheatgrass consumption amongst cancer sufferers. Wheatgrass is a
natural source of Laetrile (B-17). Breuss and Gerson treatments are non-toxic and have good success
rates.
The primary theory that underpins these treatments is
that modern, processed foods are extremely harmful to the body. Cancer,
arthritis and other degenerative diseases are rarely found in cultures
considered ""primitive"" by Western civilization.
This is regarded to
be diet-related by many nutritional anthropologists. Degenerative diseases
appear in these cultures only when modern packaged foods and additives are
introduced.
Like Breuss, Gerson regarded excess protein as a carcinogen and believed
that cancer cannot live or grow without protein. These diets are accidentally
very low in fat. A very low fat diet is ironically a very high saturated fat
diet, because when fat is in deficiency in the diet, the body switches on a
mechanism that converts carbohydrates into saturated fat.
Furthermore, because
juice fasts are deficient in calories, they stimulate ketosis and raise the
levels of ketones in the blood. Thus they exert the
same effects on the body as a high-fat ketogenic
diet, and again we have returned to the defective mitochondria theory of
cancer.
Issels
runs many alternative cancer clinics where a combination of treatments can be
obtained. The focus is on restoring the health of the immune system
(immunotherapy). Issels treatments are founded on the
holistic premise that cancer cannot develop in a healthy body, and are
influenced by Gerson, Breuss
and others.
Issels focuses on a high raw
vegetable/enzyme diet, low in protein. Issels also
advises the importance of removing toxins from the body such as mercury
fillings and pesticides, and also hidden sources of infection from the body
(such as root canals).
Coley's Toxins is an integral part of the Issels treatment, along with a separate second vaccine, Issels autologous vaccine. Click
here for a treatment
summary.
One caveat is that anyone approaching Gerson and Breuss therapies
should be skeptical of some of the wild claims made
on the internet by radical vegans denigrating ""carcinogenic"" animal
products. Unfortunately Gerson and Breuss therapies have been seized upon by the radical vegan
wing, who will actively recruit newly diagnosed cancer patients for their own
political ends.
Such advocates have a favourite argument which denigrates milk
in favour of soy, citing the example of the Chinese who ""do not use dairy
products."" Actually, the Chinese ""do"" use dairy products if they are
rich enough to afford them, and the health of those using them is superior to
the poor who do not.
The cancer rates in China are unexpectedly ""high"" for a rural nation,
despite those who would have you think otherwise. Soy is in itself a carcinogen
unfit for human consumption.
Prince Charles was criticised in the July of 2004 for promoting Gerson therapy. One criticism levelled against him at the time was that ""there is no evidence that large doses of vitamin C fight cancer."" This is an ironic and embarrassing comment for a cancer ""expert"" to make, as we shall see next.
Dr.
Matthias Rath, Linus Pauling, Vitamin C and Cellular
Therapy
What evidence is there that protein in general (or excess
protein) ""fuels"" cancer? Not that much, however CAAT (Controlled
Amino Acid Therapy), like juice fasts, has shown quite a lot of promise.
It
is not so much all protein, but certain proteins which must be
restricted. In this case the focus is on restricting one of the four amino
acids involved in DNA synthesis (glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and serine), in particular glycine, along with vitamins involved in DNA synthesis
(particularly B vitamins including folic acid and B6 restriction).
However
another part of the protein puzzle may be connected to the amino acid L-histidine and its effect on the immune system. This may be
why H2 blockers such as cimetidine,
antacids and antihistamines have some anti-cancer effect. H2 blockers suppress
the immune system by blocking histidine. L-histidine, which makes histamine, is essential for normal
immune function. Histamine is a vital component of mast cells. Infectious
agents get into the body and move around by temporarily breaking down collagen
in order to travel.
To chase down the invaders, these immune system cells also
move around the body in the same manner, by breaking down collagen, which is
repaired again afterwards by other cells. This is also how tumours grow:
emitting histamine to break down collagen. Antihistamines do appear to have an
anti-cancer effect.
Antihistamines stop immune system cells from breaking down
collagen and moving around, but they do not prevent infectious agents from
getting in and producing histamine of their own and consequently wreaking
havoc. This starvation-paralysis is the same reason that antihistamines and H2
blockers weaken the immune system. I have a friend who takes H2 blockers: he always
has a cold.
So what if you could sway the balance in another
direction? That is, instead of focusing on starving the body of histidine and making it vulnerable to infection,
give it all the fuel it needs to make collagen. Collagen is a protein that
makes connective tissue: gristle, and the non-mineral part of bones. It is
extremely tough.
Gelatin is collagen that has been made water-soluble by
lengthy boiling. It is what you end up with when you make a bone-based meat
stock or boil a pig's trotter (the foot of a pig). The perfect proportion of amino acids for making
collagen is found in... collagen. That is, gelatin.
L-lysine and L-proline are essential ingredients of
collagen.
Unlike most mammals, human beings do not make their
own vitamin C. Humans lost their ability to make their own vitamin C around
forty million or so years ago (some sources say 25 million), when we were still
primates. This has resulted in numerous genetic kludges in our make up.
Virtually all other mammals make their own vitamin C.
Compared to the average
cat, dog or goat, we're in a permanent state of subclinical scurvy, leaving us susceptible to infection,
immune system disorders, stress and weak arteries that our bodies attempt to
shore up by depositing atherosclerotic plaque. Adjusted for weight, the average
mammal makes the human equivalent of 18 grams of vitamin C per day.
The body
requires vitamin C to build collagen. Given enough vitamin C, the body eagerly
makes collagen because the enzymic reactions that
occur in the presence of vitamin C are still an essential part of our genetic
makeup. With a constant supply of the building blocks of collagen, the immune
system cells, infectious agents, and cancerous cells all have a harder time
moving around at the expense of those that don't belong there.
Don't be put off by all of the politics and conspiracy
theory on Dr. Matthias Rath's website. At least half
of what he says is completely justified, and any paranoia on Rath's part can be excused considering the personal smear
campaign waged against him over the last decade by pharmaceutical companies who
stand to lose out based on his scientific evidence: he was recently justified
by the
prosecution of Bayer, Roche and Archer-Daniels-Midland for using his
information to form a cartel and increase the price of vitamin C.
Unfortunately Rath's politics are so overt that he's
effectively shooting himself in the foot by making himself
look radical and paranoid to the average reader. Rest assured,
Rath's science is sound.
After years of denial,
avoidance and white noise, the U.S. National Institutes of Health finally
announced recently that vitamin C selectively kills cancer cells, and this was
trumpeted around the world by the media as if it were a new discovery! Those of
us who have had an inside view on the world of alternative medicine know
otherwise and look on this chain of events with a combination of frustration
and disgust.
The science is this: Rath
discovered he could suppress and reverse both heart disease and cancer by
giving people the ingredients for making collagen (anywhere between ten and
eighteen grams of vitamin C per day, plus amino acids L-lysine (half the
quantity of the vitamin C), L-proline and a few other
ingredients including a broad spectrum of other vitamins).
Rath has a cancer
education book [pdf] on his website. Everyone
should read this book. The science is supported by clinical trial evidence: no
conventional treatment (like chemotherapy or radiation therapy) can boast
anywhere near the success rate of Rath's treatments.
The facts were established fifteen years ago, ample time for the news to filter
through. It's a downright scandal the treatment isn't being used in hospitals,
which just goes to prove how the world of medicine is ruled by capital, not
science.
There may be more reasons than Rath
suspects as to why vitamin C works so well: vitamin C and glucose antagonise
each other as they're chemically similar and use the same ""pumps"" to
get into cells.
In fact, mammals make vitamin C from glucose in the
liver. In not being able to do this, humans have an integral disorder of
carbohydrate metabolism.
Cancer is anaerobic, meaning it feeds
off glucose and produces lactic acid rather than using oxygen like normal
cells. Anything that starves the cancer of glucose may help, and flooding the
cell pumps with vitamin C would conceivably deprive cells of a fuel supply.
L-lysine is another part of the story. L-lysine is an
essential amino acid (we can't make it in our bodies) that is deficient in
grain products compared to other ratios of amino acids. We receive it (and L-histidine) in perfect proportions to our bodily needs when
we eat meat or eggs.
L-lysine is easily destroyed by cooking at high
temperatures, and by cooking meats with starches and sugars. These facts
imply we aren't getting as much L-lysine as our body expects in evolutionary
terms.
I don't think much to Rath's
dietary advice: it's vague and it consists of recommendations to eat lots of
wholesome vegetables. But think about it. What diet is naturally high in
L-lysine and vitamin C and low in the primary tumour-fuel, glucose? ""A
Palaeolithic-style diet of raw or lightly cooked meat, bones, green vegetables
and berries."" What diet is naturally low in L-lysine and vitamin C and high
in the primary tumour-fuel, glucose? ""The standard Western
food pyramid rich in grains and starches and coated in sugar.""
Atkins was a Cancer Therapist
Robert Atkins MD, though best known for his weight
loss diet, was actually a complimentary therapist with a high cancer cure rate
at his clinic in New York. I found a
copy of the
Atkins cancer treatment protocol online and have reproduced it here.
Though
not included in the attached article, Atkins was experimenting with Coley's
Toxins before his death. It is rumoured that he was forced to turn people away
from the treatment in droves because of its popularity.
Atkins recommends a low sugar/lower carbohydrate diet
for cancer patients. That's because (as we've seen already) cancer feeds off
glucose almost exclusively. Whilst he stresses the importance of enzymes and
raw vegetables, Atkins doesn't recommend a low-protein diet,
instead he stresses the importance of vitamins and minerals.
The secret to the
success of Atkins' approach is that it is a holistic, combination therapy,
taking elements of all alternative cancer treatments (from mercury filling
removal to useful herbs, to natural-source vitamins).
Atkins's low-carbohydrate, high-fat approach fits in
well with the defective-mitochondria
theory of cancer cell energy utilisation , though it does not
include the addition of citric acid: ""Citric acid an intermediary product
of the Krebs cycle metabolism has also been reported to block the actions of phosphofructokinase.
A low carbohydrate, high fat diet to
increase the blood levels of ketones, along with
supplements or foods rich in citric acid may some day prove a beneficial
adjunct to chemotherapy in the treatment of many cancers.""
Atkins was not a lone crusader with regards to such
diets for cancer therapy. A
number of studies are currently underway or have recently been completed
(note this link is a rather out in the left-field with regards the Reich and
Rife information at the bottom of the page, but interesting to speculate on).
Sally Fallon and the Weston A. Price Foundation
Not directly a cancer treatment, unless you bear in
mind that native people on their traditional diets do not get cancer.
Based on the work of dentist turned anthropologist Weston A
Price, the Weston A Price Foundation
seeks to promote good nutrition based on the study of native and primitive
diets.
Fallon stresses the importance of fat-soluble vitamins and saturated fat
for proper health. After years of painstaking analysis and research of many
native groups around the world, Price found that foods from one or more of the
following groups were absolutely essential to their good health:
Seafood, fish, shellfish, fish organs, fish liver oils
and fish eggs
Organ meats from wild animals or grass fed domestic
animals
Insects
Fats of certain birds and monogastric
(one stomach) animals such as sea mammals, guinea pigs, bears and hogs
Egg yolks from pastured chicken and other birds
Whole, raw milk, cheese and butter from grass-fed
animals
Raw, unprocessed foods were vital to health and all
foods in group six were eaten raw (i.e. with enzymes and vitamin content
intact), as well as a portion of each of the other groups.
Price found that
meat-eating natives were considerably better off in health, including bone
structure, physique, height and health, than the few near-vegetarian natives he
discovered, who were often shorter and prone to more
disease (and were also more war-like). No totally vegetarian groups were found.
Native diets were 10x richer in the fat soluble
vitamins (A,D,E) and 4x richer in water soluble vitamins (B,C) than the
contemporary 1930's Western diet of Price's day. Cancer was simply unknown
amongst those on a fully native diet.
Price and his contemporaries found many
cases of native peoples who had started to eat a Westernised diet and had since
developed chronic health problems, including cancer. His cure was to send
natives back to the wilderness, at which point the diseases often simply
cleared up by themselves.
In Nourishing Traditions, a sort of native
nutrition cookbook, Fallon stresses the importance of enzyme and vitamin rich
lacto-fermented foods like live yoghurt, kefir, and sauerkraut, the
neutralisation of enzyme-inhibitors (in raw/unfermented grains, nuts, beans),
and avoidance of anti-nutrients (like processed flour, bread, pasta, white
rice, large amounts of fibre, breakfast cereals, vegetable oils, hydrogenated
oils, soy and sugar).
The Weston A. Price Foundation stress
the importance of a mixed diet, with adequate amounts of saturated fat. This diet is naturally higher in fat and lower in
carbohydrates and has a lower GI, because only unnatural, refined foods are
very high in carbohydrates and low in fat.
Starving the Cancer
What on earth do ketogenic fat-fast (low-carbohydrate,
high-fat) treatment protocols have in common with low-fat, low-protein juicing fasts ?
It would appear there is more than one way to skin a cat.
The success of
juicing fasts is often attributed to the vast quantities of antioxidants
consumed in the juice. But on closer examination the quantities of antioxidants
really aren't that impressive compared to those provided by vitamin megadosing, though they may contain useful undetected
compounds.
Vegetable juices may also contain chemotherapeutic agents, but not
really in the quantities supplied by conventional medicine. Vegetable juices
also contain a fair (but not large) amount of carbohydrate.
By contrast there
appear to be some very sensible, logical explanations for why a ketogenic diet starves cancer. So what gives? In fact, both
diets have something in common: they both cause starvation.
Every weight-loss diet produces ketosis in
varying degrees. Ketosis is the inevitable physical result of starvation. The
body tries to conserve as much glucose as possible and burns fat at an
accelerated rate.
Weight loss is not appropriate for a cancer patient.
This is why I believe a ""cycling"" method is preferable to an extended
fast, in order to regain lost weight. An extended fast of any kind also lowers
the metabolic rate, which is precisely what we do not want to do. It is vital
to keep the metabolic rate high in order to starve the cancer of fuel.
Fat
fasts are less harmful to the thyroid than other very low-calorie diets, but
will also produce accelerated weight loss for this same reason. As fasting is
so advantageous to cancer patients, it is important not to throw the baby out
with the bath water. Cycling periods of eating excess calories to regain lost
weight with intensive fasts will help to prevent the metabolism from slowing
down.
One should be able to see the similarities between
these therapies if one looks beneath the surface. Coley's toxins
appears to work by starving the
cancer whilst raising the metabolic rate.
Fat fasts, particularly when
conducted with the aide of coconut oil, can temporarily raise the metabolic
rate too (but cannot sustain it for long periods).
Fever therapy, along with
juice fasting, is an integral part of Issels therapy.
Gerson and Breuss work on
the basis of starvation too.
Raising the Metabolism
Fever therapy works by raising the metabolism. The
metabolism is governed by the thyroid. Under normal circumstances, the thyroid
dictates how warm we are and therefore how fast our cells burn energy.
Vitamins and minerals are vital to thyroid health.
Consumption of soy and various other nuts, beans and grains can impair thyroid
health. Phytic acid (found in fibre) prevents the absorption of many minerals
and is a culprit in poor thyroid function.
Vitamins A and D, iodine, selenium,
calcium and magnesium and many trace minerals are all important thyroid
nutrients. Eat a diet rich in these vitamins and nutrients.
Take cod liver oil
and use sea salt and eat seaweed and sea salt (for iodine and other trace
minerals). Shellfish are excellent. If you are allergic to dairy products,
goodly quantities of calcium and magnesium can be obtained from bone broths,
preferably cooked slowly over 24 to 48 hours. Small bony fish such as anchovies
can be pureed in a blender to provide large amounts of calcium and trace
minerals.
In general, the more calories you eat (as long as you
are well nourished by vitamins), the hotter you will become. On a day to day
basis it is important to keep your weight up, so eating plenty of calories
(whilst limiting carbohydrates and proteins) is not a
problem.
Obviously it becomes a problem if you want to fast to starve the
cancer. But in order to accelerate the metabolism beyond what is normal, you
need to consider various fever therapies.
There are many ways to induce a fever , Coley's
toxins is just one way. Less precise methods include hot baths, wrapping up
warm with a hot water bottle, brandy and champagne (together), saunas
(especially infrared light saunas), and catching a nasty infection(!) Fever
needs to occur simultaneously with ketosis.
Whilst do-it-yourself methods are
undoubtedly useful, it would be pertinent to consider checking yourself into an
alternative clinic that can induce, monitor and control your fever.

Targeted Chemotherapy
We have explored Laetrile, just one of the promising
alternative ""herbal"" therapies available. There are many more as
shown here in the atkins cancer protocol, and on
Ralph Moss's website.
You will find a great deal of overlap between the remedies listed.
All are
worthy of exploration, and there is no reason why several cannot be used at
once unless one is performing a clinical trial on oneself (not appropriate when
time is of the essence). Combination therapies are generally far more effective
than single or serial doses of different herbs.
Detoxifying
Potential carcinogens include all of the following
groups. Whilst your cancer may or may not have been triggered by one of them in
particular, conduct a close examination of your circumstances and history.
Cancers typically form between ten and thirty years before they are discovered,
you may need to think hard.
Particular pathogens (viruses and bacteria),
particularly those that remain in the body for extended periods.
Most prescription and non-prescription drugs,
including anti-inflammatories and hormonal drugs such
as The Pill.
Stimulants such as caffeine (coffee, tea, chocolate), theobromine (chocolate), tannins (wine, particularly red
wine, oak-matured wines and spirits including whisky, beers, particularly
heavy, dark beers such as stouts).
Recreational drugs (particularly stimulants such as cocaine).
Pesticides, agricultural chemicals and household chemicals.
Many food additives including MSG, and all artificial sweeteners, particularly aspartame, nitrates and sulfites.
Heavy metals such as mercury (amalgam fillings), aluminium (deodorants) and potentially fluoride (toothpaste and non-stick pans).
To detoxify physical toxins that remain in the body
such as pesticides and heavy metals, bentonite clay
is extremely helpful.
It is a ""magnetised""
clay which is added to bath water that draws out toxins. The darker the sludge
that remains in the bath, the more toxins have been
drawn out of the body.
To remove heavy metals, the most effective natural treatment is a high ""good"" fats diet that includes butter, unrefined coconut oil, lard, fish oil, etc. along with fat soluble vitamins A, D and E.
Infrared saunas are also helpful for sweating out toxins and heavy metals, whilst simultaneously providing fever therapy benefits.
Enemas, particularly organic Coffee Enemas which are used by Gerson therapy to detoxify.
Physical Injuries
Physical injuries upon the body can provoke
cancer. Cancers may occur at the sites of former wounds. Repeated severe
sunburn is a risk factor for skin cancer. This should not be confused with
regular, normal sun exposure and tanning. Regular, normal sun exposure
is protective for two reasons.
Firstly it promotes tanning which protects the
skin, and secondly it promotes the manufacture of vitamin D. Vitamin D can only
be manufactured when UVB rays (the ""burning ray"") are present during
the two hours either side of actual noon. Vitamin D is known for its
anti-cancer effects on the immune system.
Lung cancer is correlated with smoking. The
number of people who are calculated to die through passive smoking is
absolutely tiny, only a few hundred every year in Britain. The French have higher rates of lung cancer per
capita because so many of them smoke, however protective factors in the diet
mean that the percentage of people who develop lung cancer per number of
smokers is much lower than the British.
In order for lung cells to be healthy their cell membranes must be constructed out of 100% saturated fat, and the French are also a nation of fat-eaters, forty percent or
more of their calories come from fat compared to thirty percent for the
British. The French also have a better vitamin D status due to better sunlight
exposure.
It is known that cancer surgery is a risk factor for
cancer metastasis (where cancer cells spread to other areas of the body).
Causing physical injury to already damaged tissue, provoking and inflaming the
area is something that should be done with considerable caution.
Most medical sources will tell you that breast pain is
not a risk factor for breast cancer. Somewhat ironically those medical sources
will then list breast pain as a symptom of breast cancer. Breast pain is
associated with high oestrogen (estrogen) levels.
It is also associated with caffeine use,
and badly fitting bras, particularly bras with underwires. Breast pain is also associated with the use of
mammographies , which have recently been found to
increase the risk of
breast cancer !
Bras
and breast cancer , and further information.
Only one study has ever been performed with regards to bras and breast cancer.
The study was uncontrolled (it did not account for other factors such as
professional or manual job status, nutrition, medical history, stress, smoking
etc), however the results were quite shocking and very strongly correlated with
the wearing of bras.
The longer the subjects wore a bra each day, and the less
comfortable the type of bra they wore, the more likely they were to get breast
cancer. Women who wore a bra for 24 hours a day had a 75% chance of
developing breast cancer.
Results like this do not happen by accident, they
cannot be written away as coincidental, and the fact that this study has not
been repeated under controlled circumstances is a testament to the
profit-motivation, lack of imagination and entrenched conservatism of medical
authorities and cancer charities towards the health and well-being of women.
The thought of women going bra-less is obviously quite shocking to them (in
terms of their profits from bra-sponsorship deals at least).
The bottom line is, avoid physically stressing and
damaging your body, for both cancer prevention and to help prevent metastasis
or further growth.
Immune System Health
If you suffer from immune system problems or take
immunosuppressant drugs you are at greater risk of cancer. Chronic
inflammation, infections and allergens are of particular concern especially if
they are ongoing.
Continued, prolonged assaults against the immune system cause
chronic overstimulation by cytokines (substances that
draw white blood cells to areas of infection), which lead to immunodeficiency
disorders. Cancers are often indicators of late stage AIDS: they are also
caused by the immunosuppressant drugs that AIDS patients are prescribed.
As we have already learned, vitamin C is vital to
immune system health. Vitamin D is very important too, which must be accompanied by vitamins A and E. Maximise your immune
system health by eating a nourishing diet and following the Rath cancer protocol mentioned above.
Sodium Ascorbate (Vitamin C)
Vitamin C is completely harmless in very large doses.
The worst it will give you is a bit of diarrhoea. You can buy very large tubs
of ascorbic acid from Holland and Barrett and most other health shops in powder
form, which can be dissolved in water or orange juice.
Vitamin C should be
taken to bowel tolerance (when it causes loose stools), and it should be split down into two doses, one in
the morning and one in the evening.
Excess vitamin C is excreted in the faeces.
Bowel tolerance means, take vitamin C until your bowels loosen due to your body
getting rid of the excess vitamin C. Start at a dose of five grams (5,000 mg) and build up
each day until this occurs, and you have found your own personal limit.
You can take citrus bioflavinoids in a ratio of 1:10 to vitamin C. You may wish to complement with flavinoids such as rutin, hesperadin, etc.
Taking pure ascorbic acid may disagree with you. You
may experience muscle twitching or cramping, particularly during the night.
This is because vitamin C is an acid that binds to minerals and electrolytes,
and when excreted can chelate these substances out of
your body. Therefore take a multi-mineral supplement with your vitamin C.
If
you continue to have problems, you may wish to change over to sodium ascorbate. This can be made at home from powdered
ascorbic acid mixed with sodium bicarbonate (bicarbonaate of soda/baking soda). Bicarb of soda is available in pharmacies
and the baking aisle of the supermarket. Ascorbic acid is an acid, and sodium
bicarbonate is a base.
Together they make a neutralised salt. Mix equal amounts
in a glass, add water, and watch it fizz. It's perfectly safe to drink! You can
make magnesium ascorbate in a similar way, by mixing
ascorbic acid with milk of magnesia (pure magnesium hydroxide).
Because of the amounts of vitamin C required, and the
need to keep blood levels of vitamin C consistently high throughout the day,
cancer patients often use an intravenous drip or inject vitamin C
intravenously.
Some cancer patients can tolerate over 100 grams of vitamin C
per day without reaching bowel tolerance. Vitamin C should always be given as
an ascorbate if injected, and be professionally
mixed.
Buying Time and Nourishing the Body on a Low Carbohydrate Diet
Good nutrition is everything to good health. In
practice, cancer causes wasting. If a patient eats, the cancer thrives on the
glucose and the patient wastes at the expense of the cancer.
If the patient
fasts, the cancer may stop growing but the patient wastes because they are
fasting and eventually succumbs to starvation. It is absolutely vital to
prevent this wasting in order to keep the body strong. How can this be done?
You need to find out your Body Mass Index. If it
is under 20 or even 21, you have cause for concern. You need to put on
weight to stave off that wasting and weakness, in order to give your body
chance to heal itself.
Extra body fat buys time, and
the best, healthiest way to gain weight is to eat a liberal diet of wholefoods, that is high in calories and not so low in
carbohydrate that it prevents weight gain (+70 grams per day).
You should of
course avoid too much carbohydrate and particularly refined carbohydrates.
Adding an extra 500 calories a day should give you a pound a week (if
you were eating enough in the first place).
Many underweight and undernourished
people find that adding a little extra animal fat and protein to their diet is
all that is required to normalise their body weight.
Secondly, you should invest in a dietary calculator to
find out exactly how much and what kind of food you are eating.
Get plenty of natural
sunlight and avoid artificial lighting.
Eat a very rich diet of nutrient-dense foods.
Eat organic, fresh foods, eating plenty of raw and
fermented foods (homemade sauerkraut, yoghurt).
Eat only natural wholefoods.
Do not eat things out of packages or that have ingredients labels. If
the food has an ingredients label, it is processed in a factory and the chances
are it will contain a number of carcinogenic ingredients such as refined carbohydrates
and trans-fats or damaged fats, as well as a variety of carcinogenic additives.
Such foods will deplete your very precious nutrient reserves and leave you
vulnerable.
Avoid sugar and other refined carbohydrates.
Avoid vegetable oils and hydrogenated oils.
Do not eat processed meats (they contain nitrates,
common carcinogens).
Invest in some unrefined coconut oil, or try drinking or cooking
with coconut milk.
Buy all of your cosmetics and toiletries from the
health shop, including fluoride-free toothpaste and aluminium-free deodorants.
Invest in some new pans for the kitchen - avoiding
aluminium and carcinogenic non-stick Teflon.
Keep healthy snacks like nuts, olives, cheese and eggs
around to prevent succumbing to temptation. Is junk food really worth dying
for?
Bear in mind that any
radical change you choose make in your diet will probably make you feel
terrible for anywhere between two and six weeks, and it will cause a
considerable shock to your body.
Unrefined Coconut oil is a particularly
useful saturated fat that provides quick energy for the sick. It has specific
properties that heat the body and stimulate the thyroid and has proven
anti-cancer properties. As such it can become an important aspect of fever
therapy.
How much carbohydrate do you need? Carbohydrate is a non-essential dietary nutrient.
When you do not eat enough in your regular diet, your body will make it from glucogenic proteins (about 50% of proteins are glucogenic) and the glycerol component of fats (about 5% of weight).
If not supplied, your body will make around 90 grams of carbohydrate
every day in order to keep your blood sugar perfectly stable and feed your
brain. It is worth remembering that carbohydrate stimulates insulin release,
and therefore cancer cell growth.
The less carbohydrate you consume, the more
stable your blood sugar becomes as the body makes its own glucose at a very
regular rate. Preventing blood sugar spikes seems an important way of depriving
cancer cells of excess fuel.
Furthermore, the less carbohydrate you eat, the
more energy your body will derive from fats. Fats do not stimulate cancer cell
growth. As carbohydrates are not essential, eat as little as you can tolerate but
at least reduce consumption to around ninety grams.
What types of carbohydrate? Refined carbohydrates such as sugar and white flour
are considered anti-nutrients: they use up more vitamins (particularly B
vitamins) than they provide.
Beriberi (Thiamin, B1
deficiency) is endemic in India and is caused by the consumption of white rice.
Pellagra (Niacin, B3 deficiency) was widespread throughout the US Midwest in
the early part of the 20th century and was caused by a diet of corn grits,
white bread and sugar.
It seems sensible therefore to remove all refined
carbohydrates from the diet: sugar, bread (even brown bread is highly processed
and contains soy), pastries, rice, and pasta should all be avoided. Crisps,
chips, chocolate, soda-drinks and other junk foods qualify for removal too,
with additional concerns about carcinogenic additives.
With the removal of
these carbohydrates from the diet it is extremely easy to reach a target of
ninety grams of carbohydrate per day with no pain whatsoever and little shock
to the body.
In order of preference, the most nutrient rich vegetables and
fruits are: leafy green vegetables and brassicas,
berries and soft summer fruits, nuts, carrots, larger fruits (apples, mangoes,
kiwi, bananas), other root vegetables, potatoes and unrefined grains (crude rye
bread, sprouted wheat bread and oatmeal, available from health shops).
How much protein do you need? Your RDA of protein is your weight in kilograms, in
grams. If you weigh 50 kilograms, your RDA is 50 grams, if you weigh 60 kilograms, your RDA is 60 grams. Meat is approximately
20%-30% protein by weight. Protein too stimulates insulin release, but not in
such great quantities as carbohydrate. Animal protein contains L-histidine as well as L-lysine and L-proline.
It seems wise to eat no more than your RDA of protein or preferably much less,
whilst also taking supplements of the amino acids Rath
recommends, or following the CAAT protocol.
What types of protein? As protein should be restricted, it should come from
the highest quality sources. It should only come from animal sources. Eggs and
organ meats are the highest quality sources of protein, and come with the added
benefits of being extremely rich sources of vitamins and minerals.
Some people
who are sick get better by eating egg yolks alone. Bypass muscle meats in
favour of liver, kidneys, brains, sweetbreads (pancreatic and thymus glands),
lights (lungs) and tripe (stomach).
Each contains specific nutrients that will
nourish your body more thoroughly than ordinary muscle meat. Cook them as
lightly as you dare. Attempt to obtain thyroid glands and thyroid extracts as
these contain the powerful hormones you need to raise your metabolic rate and
give you an advantage over the cancer.
Whilst the Japanese suffer from less heart disease
(artery blockages) than the West, they frequently die of strokes and cancer, in fact overall cancer rates in Japan are virtually identical to European rates.
Mainstream nutritionalists
and governmental agency advice suggests we should get no more and no less than
30% of our energy from fat (this translates to between 66-83 grams of fat per
day on a 2,000-2,500 calorie diet, something many people don't achieve).
In
spite of a concerted medical campaign against fat consumption, US and EU
agencies are reluctant to advise that less energy than this come from fat, as
it is known that a variety of health problems develop on low-fat diets.
Without
enough fat it becomes impossible to absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, carotinoids, D, E, K), essential fatty acids cease to be
used effectively by the body, and a variety of issues from skin problems to
mental and nervous system problems to fatty liver and poor blood sugar control
develop.
Unfortunately no one knows how much fat we ""really"" need because
fat is such a contentious subject, and scientists have spent the last fifty
years trying (and failing) to prove that fat is a metabolic poison.
For cancer
sufferers, it is important to know that fat does not stimulate cancer growth,
or insulin release. Moreover it can stimulate the thyroid (metabolism), and
heat your body, putting cancer cells at a disadvantage.
What types of fat? Animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, suet, dripping), olive oil, coconut oil,
cocoa butter and shea butter are all good choices of fat. For more information on the science of fats,
visit this website. Also it is important to supplement with Omega 3 (DHA and EPA), vitamins A and D - found in cod liver oil. Vegetable oils and hydrogenated vegetable oils should be avoided at all costs. These are typically found in margarines, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and other food substitute products, and virtually all commercial bakery products.
How many vitamins do you need? You will be at a severe
disadvantage if your vitamin and mineral levels are low or are depleted by
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Micronutrients are essential for good immune
system health and good thyroid function. Whilst most of us can settle for our
RDA of vitamins, we have seen how vitamin megadosing
can have dramatic effects on cancer.
Fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E, plus calcium and magnesium as well as a variety of trace
minerals (ideally found in unrefined ocean sea salt) are essential for good thyroid
health.
There are also anti-nutrients you must be
aware of. Soy is a very common anti-nutrient (it is now an ingredient in all
commercial breads in the UK, salad dressing, mayonnaise and many other processed products). Consumption of soy foods is a common cause of hypothyroidism [and many other health problems].

Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Cancer Treatment: Questions and Answers
What is complementary and alternative medicine?
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)--also referred to as
integrative
medicine--includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called
complementary
when it is used
in addition to
conventional treatments; it is often called
alternative
when it is used
instead of
conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative.
Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Some commonly used methods of complementary or alternative therapy include mind/body control interventions such as visualization or relaxation; manual healing, including acupressure and massage; homeopathy; vitamins or herbal products; and acupuncture.
Are complementary and alternative therapies widely used?
Research indicates that the use of complementary and alternative therapies is increasing. A large-scale study published in the November 11, 1998, issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association
found that CAM use among the general public increased from 34 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 1997.
Several surveys of CAM use by cancer patients have been conducted with small numbers of patients. One study published in the February 2000 issue of the journal
Cancer
reported that 37 percent of 46 patients with prostate cancer used one or more CAM therapies as part of their cancer treatment. These therapies included herbal remedies, old-time remedies, vitamins, and special diets. A larger study of CAM use in patients with different types of cancer was published in the July 2000 issue of the
Journal of Clinical Oncology. That study found that 83 percent of 453 cancer patients had used at least one CAM therapy as part of their cancer treatment. The study included CAM
therapies such as special diets, psychotherapy, spiritual practices, and vitamin supplements. When psychotherapy and spiritual practices were excluded, 69 percent of patients had used at least one CAM therapy in their cancer treatment.
How are complementary and alternative approaches evaluated?
It is important that the same scientific evaluation which is used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate complementary and alternative therapies. A number of medical centers are evaluating complementary and alternative therapies by developing clinical trials (research studies with people) to test them.
Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process, including clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Often, less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Some of these complementary and alternative therapies have not undergone rigorous evaluation. Others, once considered unorthodox, are finding a place in cancer
treatment--not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. Some approaches, such as laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.
What is the Best Case Series Program?
The Best Case Series Program, which was started by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1991, is another way that early data about complementary and alternative approaches are evaluated. The Best Case Series Program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Through the Best Case Series Program, health care professionals who offer CAM services submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. The OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and presents the approaches that have the most therapeutic potential to the Cancer Advisory Panel for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAPCAM) for further review.
CAPCAM was jointly created in 1999 by the NCI and the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). CAPCAM's membership is drawn from a broad range of experts from the conventional and CAM cancer research and practice communities. CAPCAM evaluates CAM cancer approaches that are submitted through the Best Case Series Program, and makes recommendations to NCCAM on whether and how these approaches should be followed up.
Is NCI sponsoring clinical trials in complementary and alternative medicine?
The NCI is currently sponsoring several clinical trials (research studies with patients) that study complementary and alternative treatments for cancer. Current trials include enzyme therapy with nutritional support for the treatment of inoperable pancreatic cancer, shark cartilage therapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and studies of the effects of diet on prostate and breast cancers. Some of these trials compare alternative therapies with conventional treatments, while others study the effects of complementary approaches used in addition to conventional treatments. Patients who are interested in taking part in these or any clinical trials should talk with their doctor.
More information about clinical trials sponsored by the NCI can be obtained from NCCAM, OCCAM, and the NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS) (see below).
What should patients do when considering complementary and alternative therapies?
Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor or nurse, as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.
When considering complementary and alternative therapies, what questions should patients ask their health care provider?
What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
What are the risks associated with this therapy?
Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
What side effects can be expected?
Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?
Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? If so, who is sponsoring the trial?
Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
How can patients and their health care providers learn more about complementary and alternative therapies?
Patients and their doctor or nurse can learn about complementary and alternative therapies from the following Government agencies:
The
NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
(NCCAM) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public.

Unconventional Cancer Treatments
Chapter 5: Pharmacologic and Biologic Treatments
A large and diverse group of unconventional cancer treatments has as its central component a pharmacologic or biologic substance, including biochemical agents, vaccines, blood products, and synthetic chemicals. Some of these pharmacologic and biologic treatments are offered at single
sites under the direction of a developer or other chief proponent. Others are more widely available, are not necessarily associated with particular proponents, and may be used in combination with a variety of other unconventional and conventional treatments.
Examples of unconventional pharmacologic or biologic cancer treatments associated with a single practitioner include: ""Antineoplastons"" offered by Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., at his clinic in Houston; an autogenous vaccine developed by the late Virginia Livingston, M.D.,
at her clinic in San Diego; ""eumetabolic"" treatment offered by Hans Nieper, M.D., in Hannover, West Germany; and ""biologically guided chemotherapy"" practiced by Emanuel Revici, M.D., at his office in New York. Each of these treatments is discussed in detail below.
Another pharmacologic treatment, ""Immuno-Augmentative Therapy"" offered by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D., at his clinics in the Grand Bahamas, West Germany, and Mexico, is discussed in chapter 6.
Examples of pharmacologic approaches offered at a number of places, either singly or in combination, include laetrile, megavitamins, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), cell treatment, digestive enzymes, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and a variety of other agents. When used in various combinations
and with special diets, enemas, and instructions about avoiding substances thought to be harmful, these treatments become part of a general approach often referred to as ""metabolic therapy,"" a non-specific term used by many unconventional practitioners to refer to a combination
of unconventional approaches aimed at improving the physical and mental condition of cancer patients (96). Many of the best known ""metabolic clinics"" are located in or near Tijuana, Mexico, not far from the US border, e.g., Centro Medico del Mar, American Biologics, the Manner
clinic, St. Judes International, and Hospital Santa Monica. Practitioners associated with these clinics include Ernesto Contreras, Robert Bradford, Jimmy Keller, and Kurt Donsbach. Some of the major components of
the ""metabolic"" treatments (vitamin C, laetrile, DMSO, cellular treatment, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone) are also discussed in this chapter. The treatments are presented in alphabetical order according to the name of the main practitioner or the substance used.
Stanislaw Burzynski and Antineoplastons
In the late 1960s, Stanislaw R. Burzynski, MD, proposed that a naturally occurring and continuously functioning biochemical system in the body, distinct from the immune system, could ""correct"" cancer cells by means of ""special chemicals that reprogram misdirected
cells."" He called these chemicals ""Antineoplastons,"" and defined them as naturally occurring peptides and amino acid derivatives that inhibit the growth of malignant cells while leaving normal cells unaffected (124,133). Peptides are a broad category of molecules, including
many biologically active proteins, that are made up of combinations of amino acids. Burzynski developed a treatment regimen for cancer based on the administration of various types of Antineoplastons, which he originally isolated from urine and subsequently synthesized in the laboratory. He
currently treats patients with Antineoplastons at his clinic and research facility in Texas.
Burzynski received his MD in 1967 and his PhD in biochemistry the following year, both from the Medical Academy of Lublin in Poland. He moved to the United States in 1970, and obtained a license to practice medicine in Texas in 1973. From 1970 until 1977, he held the positions of
research associate and assistant professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. In 1977, he left Baylor to establish his own research institute. He is now president of the Burzynski Research Institute in Stafford, Texas, where he and his colleagues conduct in vitro and animal
research on Antineoplastons. Burzynski's clinical practice focuses on treatment of cancer patients with Antineoplastons, which he administers at his outpatient clinic in Houston. His current regimen for cancer patients includes oral and intravenous use of approximately 10 types of
Antineoplastons, all of which are manufactured at the Burzynski Research Institute.
From 1974 to 1976, Burzynski received funding from NCI for research involving gel filtration techniques to isolate peptides from urine and for testing their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of several types of cultured human cells (142). In 1976, Burzynski applied unsuccessfully for
renewal of this grant, although he did receive supplemental funding until July 1977 (245). In 1983, he applied to FDA for an Investigational New Drug exemption (IND), which would allow him to use Antineoplastons in human studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of
Antineoplastons. That application was put on ""clinical hold,"" the action taken by FDA in cases where data submitted are insufficient to justify the investigational use of a substance in cancer patients. In March, 1989 the clinical hold was removed for one study, allowing a study
of the oral form of Antineoplaston A10 in a small number of women with advanced, refractory, breast cancer (125). That study, which was planned to be conducted at a U.S. medical center, was later ""delayed,"" according to a public notice from Burzynski's staff, ""due to the
high cost"" of conducting clinical trials in the United States (858). To date, no form of Antineoplaston has yet received FDA approval for use on patients outside of that specific study.
Burzynski first isolated Antineoplastons from blood and then the urine of individuals without cancer. Burzynski developed the laboratory methodology to make at least one type of Antineoplaston (A10) synthetically. He reportedly obtained dozens of fractions (128), each containing many
different Antineoplastons (133). Burzynski and other researchers reported testing each fraction for anticancer activity in cultured human cells and then for toxicity in animals. His first fraction, Antineoplaston A, which he used to treat 21 cancer patients at a hospital in Houston (143),
was later subdivided into fractions A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 (132,133). Fraction A2 was reported to contain an ""active"" ingredient which was named Antineoplaston A10; Burzynski identified the chemical structure of A10 as 3- phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione (131). In addition
to using it to treat patients, Burzynski supplies this product to the Sigma Chemical Company, which offers it for sale through its catalogue for research purposes. Two degradation products of Antineoplaston A10, identified as Antineoplastons AS2-1 and AS2-5 (130), have also been
administered to cancer patients (see discussion below).
Burzynski believes that a variety of Antineoplastons are present naturally in the tissue and body fluids of healthy people, but that, possibly as a consequence of cachexia (a metabolic process that results in physical wasting), cancer patients excrete excessive amounts in the urine,
leaving them with low circulating levels. He states that treatment with Antineoplastons reduces the amount of endogenous Antineoplastons excreted, and that excretion of Antineoplastons decreases with tumor regression (133). Burzynski hypothesizes that Antineoplastons may act by interfering
with the action of certain enzymes complexes (methylation complex isozymes) that allow malignant cells to gain a growth advantage over normal cells (546). He has also suggested that Antineoplastons may interact directly with DNA (524).
Burzynski believes that Antineoplastons represent a ""completely new class of compounds"" (516). It is unclear whether or how Burzynski's Antineoplastons relate to a variety of known growth factors and inhibitors that are the focus of considerable mainstream research in
biochemistry and oncology. Burzynski's theory of a biochemical antitumor surveillance system in the body mediated by endogenous Antineoplastons has not been recognized in the broader U.S. scientific community. However, some scientists have recently begun using Antineoplastons supplied by
Burzynski to examine its biochemical and physiologic properties, particularly antitumor activity, in cultured tumor cells and in animal tumor models (see discussion below).
Burzynski's Treatment Regimen
At present, oral and intravenous forms of ten types of Antineoplaston are made by the Burzynski Research Institute; most patients reportedly take the oral form (124). Treatment starts with small doses and increases gradually until Burzynski determines that an optimal level has been
reached. In some cases, Burzynski also prescribes low-dose chemotherapy (124) and a variety of common prescription drugs (134,136,138). Burzynski claims that following initial treatment with Antineoplastons, some patients produce sufficient quantities of endogenous Antineoplastons and no
longer need treatment, while others continue taking oral doses of Antineoplastons to ""guard against future recurrence of cancer"" (124).
The patient brochure from the Burzynski Research Institute states that the treatment is ""non-toxic"" (124), but that a ""small percentage of patients had some adverse reaction sometime during the course of treatment."" Side effects cited include ""excessive gas in
the stomach, slight skin rash, slightly increased blood pressure, chills and fever"" (124).
There are no reports of adverse effects from Burzynski's treatment in the published literature. One unpublished report based on a site visit to the Burzynski Research Institute noted two patients who developed sepsis after treatment, one of whom died, although it did not include
information confirming the association between the patients' death and Burzynski's treatment. The authors of that report noted that one possible route of infection is through intravenous injections into an indwelling subclavian catheter; infections of the indwelling lines would be likely
if aseptic technique is not followed; this is more likely if the patient is not thoroughly instructed in the techniques of aseptic injection (79). Walde, who visited Burzynski's facilities in 1982, also noted this risk of catheter sepsis and air emboli resulting from patients administering
their own intravenous doses through indwelling subclavian catheters, but concluded that ""the number of complications that [Burzynski and his associates] have been aware of, or have been notified of, have been extremely low"" (933).
Claims
While treatment success rates are not specifically cited in the Burzynski Research Institute patient brochure, such rates are widely quoted in the popular literature. An article in Macleans magazine, for example, credits Burzynski with a 46% rate of ""total remission for cancer of
the colon"" from the use of one type of Antineoplaston. That article also reports that Burzynski has had the most success with cancers of the bladder, breast, prostate, and bone (291). A recent newspaper article quotes a spokeswoman for the Burzynski clinic as saying that
""preliminary studies show that 80% of tumor patients respond positively to the treatment"" (721).
Burzynski does claim that the ""majority of cancer patients treated at [the Burzynski Research] Institute showed positive response to treatment"" (124). His patient brochure states that Antineoplaston treatment makes it ""possible to obtain complete remission of certain
types of cancer"" and that ""the number of patients who are free of cancer over five years as the result of Antineoplaston therapy is steadily increasing"" (124). In addition to their postulated therapeutic role, Antineoplastons are claimed to be useful in diagnosing cancer.
Burzynski believes that measuring the levels of naturally circulating Antineoplastons in blood and urine ""may help to identify individuals who are more susceptible to the development of cancer or to diagnose the cancer at the early stages"" (129,133).
These claims are based on a number of recent clinical studies in which Burzynski reported favorable clinical outcomes, including complete remissions, partial remissions, and stabilization of disease, in patients with various types of advanced cancer, following injection of
Antineoplaston A2 (137), A3 (140), A5 (141), A10 (138), AS2-1 (136), and AS2-5 (134). Burzynski reported that 3 of these Antineoplastons (A3, A5, and A10) will be studied in phase II trials.
Burzynski occasionally publicizes his treatment via press releases. In a recent statement, for example, it was announced that ""dramatically improved results in the treatment of prostate cancer due to a recent discovery made within the past year"" had been obtained through
Burzynski's administration of Antineoplastons given orally. It noted that ""with this route of administration, some prostate cancer patients, even those whose cancer failed to respond to conventional therapy, have experienced a complete remission of their cancer in as little time as
five months"" (126). In that press release and another one (127), it was claimed that Burzynski's treatment ""may also be effective in diagnosing and preventing some types of cancer,"" citing results from experimental animal studies conducted at the Burzynski Research Institute
and at the University of Kurume, Japan.
Published Clinical Studies
Burzynski and his colleagues at the Burzynski Research Institute have a long list of published papers and presentations at meetings in which they report on animal and biochemical studies of Antineoplastons, as well as on studies of their use in cancer patients. Most of Burzynski's
recent clinical papers (studies of the effects of Antineoplastons on cancer patients, as opposed to laboratory research) appear in supplements to the journal Drugs Under Experimental and Clinical Research, one in 1986 and one in 1987. These supplements were devoted entirely to
Antineoplastons and all publication and printing charges for these supplements were borne by Burzynski (840). Though most medical journals do not charge authors for publishing papers, it is not uncommon for authors to pay a fee for publication and printing.
Burzynski's list of publications (124) includes a number of ""phase I clinical studies,"" along with several other types of study that also include clinical outcome data, such as ""initial clinical studies,"" and ""toxicology studies."" Many of these studies are
listed as presentations made at conferences outside the United States; these reports are not readily available in the open literature. Many of the published studies appear in the Drugs Under Experimental and Clinical Research supplements, one appears in a journal or a book cited as
Advances in Experimental and Clinical Chemotherapy (which is not listed at the National Library of Medicine), and one appears in a book, which presents the same data as a paper in one of the supplements.
Despite the fact that these are reported as early stage studies, which in mainstream research would concentrate on toxicology (i.e., safety more than efficacy), they also report on clinical outcomes, including partial and complete remissions. Burzynski's reputation for success rests at
least in part on these reports. OTA's concern with these studies is that, among other problems, Burzynski's definition of a remission, while not stated in any of the papers, appears to be discrepant from the generally accepted definition, making the results difficult if not impossible to
understand. (In conventional terminology, regressions may occur in patients who initially have ""measurable disease,"" which means that tumors that can either be felt during physical examination or can be seen clearly on some type of diagnostic film or scan, and which can be
measured in at least two dimensions. A complete regression is said to occur when the disease measured can no longer be found at all. Partial regression describes the condition where the measurable tumor is reduced by at least 50% in size.)
Three papers from the 1987 Drugs Under Experimental and Clinical Research supplement are representative (""Initial clinical study with Antineoplaston A2 injections in cancer patients with five years' follow-up"" (139) ""Phase I clinical studies of Antineoplaston A3
injections"" (140) and ""Phase I clinical studies of Antineoplaston A5 injections"" (140)). These are discussed below.
These three papers have similar formats and have a similar level of detail, so some general observations can be made about them. First, the reports raise a question about whether these studies were actually planned, with protocols including patient selection criteria, specific
recordkeeping requirements, etc. (a ""clinical trial""), or whether they represent groups of patients studied retrospectively. Details concerning a protocol, that would be expected in reporting a clinical trial, are generally lacking. In addition, there is little systematic
information about patients' treatment prior to Antineoplastons, except in specific cases, some of which are discussed below. A table with certain information about each individual patient (diagnosis, age, sex, length of Antineoplaston treatment, highest dosage, adverse reactions, desirable
side-effects, and anticancer effect) is included in each of these papers.
A particular difficulty with these papers is that some important terms -- e.g., ""complete regression"" and ""partial regression,"" terms used to describe the effectiveness of Antineoplastons in these papers -- are not used in accordance with their generally-accepted
definitions.4 In the first Burzynski study cited above, six ""complete remissions"" were reported among 15 patients described as having ""advanced neoplastic disease."" Three of these six patients were reported to have non-metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder, grade II, which would not be described as ""advanced"" by mainstream definitions. These three patients are described in some detail. Two of them reportedly had no measurable malignant disease when they began Antineoplaston treatment. According to the article:
Patient D.D., diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, Grade II, had seven transurethral resections of the tumours and six recurrences in 16 months preceding the treatment with Antineoplaston A2. Her treatment began shortly after the last transurethral resection,
therefore she did not have measurable tumour at that time. The patient was in complete remission and free from recurrences for two years and six weeks as the result of treatment with Antineoplaston A2 intravenous injections. She developed recurrence one year and two months after
discontinuation of Antineoplaston A2 injections.
Patient J.J....underwent transurethral resection of the tumour shortly before the beginning of the treatment with Antineoplaston A2 injections. He was found to have no recurrence after 56 days of treatment and decided to discontinue the therapy at that time. Five months later, he
developed recurrence and underwent transurethral resection of the tumour and instillation of Thiotepa. The patient was disease- free for over five years.
Neither of these patients had measurable malignant disease when treatment began and both had recurrences after treatment. Patient J.J. had curative conventional surgery and chemotherapy as treatment for the recurrence. Burzynski counts both of these patients as complete remissions, and
J.J. as a five-year survivor, as a result of Antineoplaston treatment. However, the evidence presented does not substantiate the claimed benefit to either patient from the treatment.
In the second paper, another patient in ""complete remission"" is described as having ""adenocarcinoma of the colon, status post resection,"" meaning that the tumor had been removed surgically before the patient started treatment with Antineoplastons:
The patient...maintained complete remission during the treatment with Antineoplaston A3...After discontinuation of this form of treatment he developed recurrence with liver metastases, which responded to treatment with different formulations of Antineoplastons and 5-fluorouracil. This
patient is alive, well and free from cancer over six years after his participation in Phase I studies with Antineoplaston A3.
This patient evidently had no measurable disease when Antineoplaston A3 treatment started, but reportedly had a ""recurrence,"" was treated with conventional chemotherapy plus Antineoplastons, and then was reported free of cancer. There is no evidence that this patient was
helped by Antineoplastons, and the case does not describe a ""complete remission"" attributable to that treatment.
Another unusual feature of these studies is the section describing increases in platelet and white blood cell counts as ""desirable side-effects."" In each case, the post- treatment levels are not just increased, but are abnormally high. In the case of platelet counts, levels
are high enough (ranging from about 500,000 to 3.4 million) to lead to possible blood clotting. The authors do not explain why these effects should be considered desirable; physicians would usually consider these levels as indicators of underlying disease or as risks for serious medical
complications.
Attempts at Evaluating Antineoplastons
In 1983 and 1985, at the request of the Canadian Bureau of Human Prescription Drugs, NCI tested three of Burzynski's Antineoplastons for antitumor effects in the mouse P388 Leukemia assay, a test that NCI used routinely as a prescreen for antitumor activity until 1985 (see ch. 12 for
details) (2,602). No antitumor activity (as measured by a statistical increase in survival) was found for Antineoplastons A2 and A5. Both showed toxicity at the highest dose given, while at lower doses, neither antitumor effect nor toxicity was found. Both Antineoplastons were found
inactive over wide dose ranges (602). Antineoplaston A10 was also tested in a range of concentrations in this mouse system, and the results indicated that there was no increase in survival at any concentration and there was toxicity at the higher dose levels (360).
More recently, Antineoplaston A10 has been studied in several experimental animal tumor systems. Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia reported on results indicating that oral Antineoplaston A10 delayed the development of viral-induced mammary tumors in C3H+ mice and inhibited
the growth of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats (393). Eriguchi and colleagues at Kurume University, Japan, presented results suggesting antitumor effects of Antineoplaston A10 on the development of urethane-induced pulmonary adenomas in A/WySnJ mice (275). A second
group at Kurume University reported that Antineoplaston A10 reduced the growth of human breast cancer cells in athymic mice (385). Recent experiments using human and mouse tumor cell lines were summarized in an abstract written by researchers at the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences, Maryland. It was noted that Antineoplaston AS2-1 promoted cell differentiation in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells grown in culture and suppressed some of the neoplastic properties of mouse fibrosarcoma V7T cells in culture (775).
A 1981 television news report (""20/20"") on Burzynski's cancer treatment, followed by numerous inquiries from patients about the treatment, reportedly prompted David Walde, a physician practicing in Ontario, to visit Burzynski's facilities in April 1982. In his written report
(933), which he sent unsolicited to Health and Welfare Canada and to NCI, Walde described Burzynski's clinical and research facilities and summarized the treatment regimen. He reportedly also reviewed about 60 patient records, but did not report on them in detail. He concluded that there
was sufficient information about Burzynski's treatment to warrant evaluating ""the nature and action of [Antineoplastons]...even if these eventually do not result in any major therapeutic advances"" and recommended that Burzynski apply for investigatory new drug clearance in Canada
so that Walde could coordinate clinical studies with Canadian health officials. He also suggested that outside funding sources be sought to support clinical studies, and advised against ""sensationalism through the public media,"" to avoid disruption to ongoing and future clinical
studies.
In November 1982, consultants to the Ontario (Canada) Ministry of Health visited Burzynski's clinical and research facilities in Houston for the purpose of providing information to the Ministry of Health about the treatment because some Ontario residents had sought reimbursement under
the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (79). After reviewing Burzynski's published papers and viewing the clinic and laboratories, the consultants, Martin Blackstein and Daniel Bergsagel, asked Burzynski to select examples of patients who he believed had had a good response to Antineoplaston
treatment. They specified that each case had to satisfy the following conditions to be considered: 1) proven histologic diagnosis of cancer; 2) complete record of all cancer treatment before Antineoplastons (some of which might be responsible for a delayed response); 3) complete record of
additional treatment; and 4) original X-rays, CT, or isotope scans used to document a response.
Burzynski presented them with about 12 cases at the clinic, and sent them additional cases afterward. According to the report, there were original X-rays for only one case; for two others, selected CT scans were available. The case with X-ray evidence was a patient with metastatic
nodules in the lung from a colon cancer, which, from his history, appeared to be a slowly progressing disease. The consultants concluded that the X-rays showed no documentable change, though there were difficulties in interpretation because the films were reportedly taken on different
machines with different magnifications. They also concluded that the two patients for whom some CT scans were available showed no definite response to Antineoplaston treatment. In those cases, they believed that the views on the scans were not the same, making direct comparison impossible.
In other cases, the consultants reported that Burzynski's patients had had effective treatment for treatable cancers before starting Antineoplaston treatment, and they described two specific examples. The first was a woman who had had radiation treatment for stage III cervical cancer,
and had gone to Burzynski when there was still necrotic tumor in the cervix; a cytologist was unsure whether any viable cancer cells remained, but noted extensive radiation changes. The tumor gradually disappeared, which the consultants felt could be attributed to the prior radiation,
rather than to Antineoplastons. The other patient had prostatic cancer with bone metastases who had had an orchiectomy three months before beginning Antineoplastons. His bone scans improved, which the consultants attributed to the delayed effects of the orchiectomy, which commonly takes
months for full effects to become evident.
On the basis of the cases they reviewed, Blackstein and Bersagel reported that they found no examples of objective response to Antineoplastons. In addition to reviewing the cases, they asked about four patients reported by Burzynski in 1977 to have had complete remissions with
treatment. According to the report, three of those patients had progressed fairly rapidly and died. The fourth patient was still alive at the time of the review (1982), but the consultants felt his disease (a solitary bladder tumor) had disappeared as a result of the biopsy. In conclusion,
Blackstein and Bersagel's report recommended that the Ontario Health Insurance Plan not cover the cost of Antineoplaston treatment for Ontario residents.
Burzynski wrote a detailed rebuttal (135) to their report, charging that Blackstein and Bersagel ""completely distorted the research, production, and clinical data presented to them."" He disagreed with each individual assessment, concluding that:
Out of the initial nine cases presented in the clinic, six patients obtained complete remission and two remaining patients were very close to complete remission. Only one patient was treated with radiation and chemotherapy and one additional patient received a very small dose of
palliative radiotherapy before coming for the treatment with antineoplastons. Two patients died from causes unrelated to cancer like multiple emboli in the lungs and perforation of the stomach ulcer (135).
Burzynski contested the report's judgments on the quality and content of the clinical data. He cited clinical records (photocopies of which he included) to show that each case was confirmed by biopsy and that ""the remission of each of them was confirmed by at least one other doctor
not associated with our clinic.""
In 1985, in a separate and more limited effort to gather information about Burzynski's treatment, the Canadian Bureau of Prescription Drugs reportedly contacted 25 physicians with patients who had visited Burzynski's clinic in Houston for treatment with Antineoplastons. According to a
memo summarizing the effort (829), information on clinical outcomes in 36 patients from five provinces reportedly consisted of tumor type and clinical status as reported by telephone from the physicians (actual records were apparently not obtained). Of the 36 patients noted by the
physicians, 32 had died with ""no benefit"" from the treatment, one had died after having a ""slight regression for two months,"" one died after having been stable for a year, followed by progression of disease, and two were alive at the time of the survey. Of the two who
were alive, one had metastatic lung cancer and the other had cervical cancer, and both had received radiotherapy prior to Antineoplaston treatment. The memo does not indicate the existence of more detailed data on the clinical course of these patients (including time between treatment and
outcome recorded) or the basis for selecting the 25 physicians for the survey. OTA's requests to the Canadian Bureau of Prescription Drugs for further information about this survey have been denied. It is not possible to draw conclusions about efficacy or safety of Antineoplaston treatment
from this limited information, since it was a retrospective analysis of self-selected patients and there may have been bias toward reporting poor outcomes.
Unfortunately, despite a substantial number of preliminary clinical studies presented by Burzynski and his associates describing outcomes among the patients he treated with Antineoplastons, and an attempt at a ""best case"" review, there is still a lack of valid information to
judge whether this treatment is likely to be beneficial to cancer patients. Thus far, prospective, controlled clinical studies of Antineoplastons, which could yield valid information on efficacy, have not been conducted.
Cellular Treatment
Cellular treatment refers to a group of related procedures that may be referred to as ""live cell therapy,"" ""cellular therapy,"" ""cellular suspensions,"" ""glandular therapy,"" or ""fresh cell therapy."" In general, cellular treatment involves
injections or ingestion of processed tissue obtained from animal embryos or fetuses. It was developed in Switzerland in the early 1930's by Paul Niehans, MD, and became widely known when various public figures received the treatment and claimed it restored their youth or extended their
lives (26). One of Neihans' colleagues, Wolfram Kuhnau, MD, introduced the treatment in Tijuana in the late 1970s (238,490). Currently, at least five Tijuana clinics offer cellular treatment as a component of ""metabolic therapy"" (289,968). To OTA's knowledge, cellular treatment
is not widely practiced in the United States, although no Federal or State law prohibits physicians from preparing his or her own cellular treatments for patients. FDA has issued an import alert concerning the detention of shipments of foreign cellular treatment products to the United
States (887).
Cellular treatment uses a variety of materials, including whole fetal animal cells (derived, e.g., from sheep, cows, and recently also sharks (491)) and cell extracts from juvenile or adult animal tissue. The organs and glands used in cell treatment include brain, pituitary, thyroid,
adrenals, thymus, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, heart, ovary, testis, and parotid (261). Several different types of cell can be given simultaneously -- some practitioners routinely give up to 20 or more at once (489).
A number of different processes are used to prepare cells for use. One form of the treatment involves the injection into the buttocks of freshly removed fetal animal tissue, which has been processed and suspended in an isotonic salt solution. The preparation of fresh cells then may be
either injected immediately into the patient, or preserved by being lyophilized (freeze-dried) or frozen in liquid nitrogen before being injected. In the latter process, the preserved cells can be tested for pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites, before use. Fresh cells, in
contrast, are used before such testing can be performed. Other types of cellular treatment may use rehydrated concentrates in tablet or capsule form taken orally.
The types of cell given are reported to correspond in some way with the organ or tissue in the patient that is diseased or malfunctioning (""like cells help like cells"" (261)). Proponents claim that the injected cells ""travel to the similar organ from which they were taken
to revitalize and stimulate that organ's function,"" an effect which is said to have been ""validated by scientifically controlled laboratory and clinical experiments"" (322).
Proponents of cellular treatment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue contains active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins, minerals, hormones, or enzymes, and ""the fact that these active agents have not yet been identified seems of little consequence"" (261).
Kuhnau claims that cellular treatment ""stimulate[s] weak organ function and regenerate[s] its cellular structure"" (489). Proponents claim that cellular treatment is accepted by the body because ""embryonic cells from unborn animals...are immunologically inactive and hence not
recognized as 'nonself' by the patient's immune system"" (238). It is stated that the cellular treatment using cells from endocrine organs ""harmonize hormones...[and] balance the intricate hormone-producing and feedback mechanisms of the endocrine system"" (238). Cellular
treatment is also claimed to stimulate the immune system.
Although cancer is not one of the primary conditions for which cellular treatment is promoted, cellular treatment is included in the array of treatments offered to cancer patients at ""metabolic"" clinics in Tijuana (490). Positive results following cellular treatment have been
claimed for a wide variety of genetic, neurologic, and multifactorial conditions, including Down Syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, lupus, arthritis, muscular dystrophy, and infertility (238). At one Tijuana clinic
where cancer patients reportedly make up 70% of the caseload, cellular treatment, using umbilical cord tissue in particular, is ""increasingly being given in cancer therapy"" at a frequency per patient of several ""rounds"" per year (238).
Kuhnau claims that ""in the hands of a physician trained in this form of therapy, the proper selection of cells and their appropriate administration provides a well-tolerated treatment which is virtually free of side effects"" (489). He claims never to have seen a fatality or
toxic reaction to the material (238).
A number of adverse effects could, however, be associated with cellular treatment. Allergic reactions to calf thymus tissue derived from five-day-old animals were noted in patients with histiocytosis-X, a heterogeneous group of rare disorders, and cellular treatment was stopped in these
patients (698). A recent report in the British Medical Journal described a case of a 79-year-old man who developed antibodies against human skin antigens and signs of an autoimmune skin disease following injections of extracts of human placental tissue (778). Cellular treatment also poses
a risk of transmitting bacterial or viral infections, such as brucellosis (a generalized infection characterized by fever, sweating, and pain in the joints) or encephalomyelitis (a viral infections characterized by inflammation of the brain and spinal cord), from donor animals to recipient
patients, as noted in a 1984 FDA ""talk paper"" (885).
A number of serious immunological reactions to cellular treatment in West Germany were noted in a recent report in Lancet (514). In one example cited, a woman athlete reportedly received several hundred injections of cellular therapy and subsequently went into fatal anaphylactic shock.
(Anaphylaxis is an immediate, exaggerated immunologic (allergic) reaction to a foreign protein to which the body has become hypersensitized as a result of past exposure. Anaphylaxis is frequently treatable with appropriate medical care, but in the absence of treatment, it can be fatal.)
Other adverse effects were also noted in that report, including immune vasculitis, encephalitis, and polyradiculitis following cellular treatment, and a delayed effect of chronic progressive neurological disease with perineural inflammation and demyelination. A 1957 survey of 179 West
German hospitals reportedly revealed 80 cases of serious immunological reactions, 30 of them fatal, in cellular treatment recipients. On the basis of these findings, the West German Federal Health Office suspended the product licenses of a number of commercial cellular preparations
(including lyophilized or freeze-dried whole-cell preparations and cell extracts), and ""strongly recommended"" that the use of fresh cell preparations, which are made in the clinics themselves and do not come under pharmaceutical regulations, also be stopped.
Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly available product with a wide variety of non-medical uses. In industry, it has been used as a chemical solvent. In laboratory research, it is often used as a cryopreservative for cultured cells. One of the properties of DMSO is that it is absorbed
very rapidly through the skin and cell membranes, carrying along almost anything else (particularly low molecular weight molecules) dissolved in it that would not otherwise be able to cross those barriers. Intravenous and oral administration of DMSO allow it to penetrate rapidly into
vascular and non- vascular tissues in the body (854). Its popular use among athletes, people with arthritis, and others have stemmed from claims that topical DMSO reduces pain, decreases swelling, and promotes healing of injured tissue. The FDA approved the use of bladder instillations of
a 50% solution of DMSO (sold under the trade name ""Rimso-50"") to relieve symptoms of interstitial cystitis, a painful chronic bladder disorder (884). At present, ""Rimso-50"" is still the only DMSO product approved by FDA for use in humans. DMSO available in health food
stores or by mail order is an industrial form of the chemical, consisting of about 99% DMSO, and is not labeled for human use (45).
DMSO is commonly used in unconventional cancer treatments, particularly in ""metabolic"" treatments, such as those offered at several clinics in Tijuana and in the United States (e.g., at a hospital in Zion, Illinois and at clinics in Nevada, Pennsylvania, and California (289)).
DMSO is often combined with laetrile and vitamin C, among other substances, and administered to patients intravenously. For example, the ""Manner Cocktail,"" consisting of 10cc of DMSO, 25 grams of vitamin C, and 9 grams of laetrile dissolved in a 250cc bag of a 5% dextrose
solution (574), is used to treat cancer patients at the Manner Clinic in Tijuana.
DMSO has been studied in mainstream research for a variety of possible therapeutic uses. As a possible cytotoxic agent, DMSO has been studied in human tumor cell lines and in human tumor model systems in animals, and in each case, DMSO demonstrated no activity (243). As a possible tumor
differentiating agent (942) (a substance that stimulates tumor cells to undergo development to mature, benign cells (827)), DMSO was found to be active in mouse and human leukemic cell cultures and in human solid tumor cell cultures (243,827), but it did not improve survival in animals
implanted with human tumor cells (243); this lack of an effect in vivo is the basis for NCI classifying DMSO as a relatively weak differentiating agent, compared to other available agents (243).
As a potential enhancer of the activity of known cytotoxic agents, DMSO was found to increase the activity of some of these agents in tumor-bearing rats (854). DMSO has been tested experimentally for antitumor effects, both in various tissue culture and in animal systems, and was found
to be inactive. In a clinical study using DMSO in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, DMSO did not enhance the effect of cyclophosphamide (319).
One of the most widely available sources of information about the use of DMSO in unconventional cancer treatments is the booklet commonly available in health food stores, Dr. Donsbach Tells You What You Always Wanted to Know About DMSO (263). In this booklet, it is claimed that
""while DMSO has not brought 'cure' for health problems, it has been and is now the source of comfort for millions of medical consumers."" Donsbach states that DMSO acts by making cancer cells ""behave more normally by bringing about a mitotic turnabout."" He proposes its
use as a treatment to relieve pain, to slow the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, to control inflammation and swelling, to relieve burns and sprains, and to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, herpes, tuberculosis, sinusitis, and cancer. Another source in the popular literature
discusses the use of DMSO in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (593).
Mildred Miller, an advocate of DMSO use in cancer treatment (616), claims that intravenous DMSO ""dissolves the protein shell surrounding the cancer cells and begins to restore the abnormal cell to normalcy"" (615) and that it ""stimulate[s] the body's own immune system, as
well as altering the cancer cell, causing it to become mature or burn out"" (617). Miller is associated with a clinic in Las Vegas that uses DMSO as one of its main components of cancer treatment.
Topical application of DMSO has been associated with redness, itching, and inflammation of the skin and a garlic- like taste and odor on the breath. Intravenous administration of DMSO has been reported to cause transient hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), resulting in urinary
excretion of hemoglobin (45,983). Several additional adverse effects of DMSO are mentioned in the Donsbach booklet (263), including ""possible damaging effects to the liver, the kidneys, bloodforming organs, and the central nervous system""; and ""headache, dizziness, nausea,
and sedation.""
Toxic effects to the lens of the eye were reported in studies involving the use of DMSO in dogs, rabbits, and pigs, although no such effects have been noted in studies with human subjects (45). The safety of prolonged use of DMSO in humans has not been established.
Hydrazine Sulfate
In the mid-1970s, one of the commonly discussed unconventional cancer treatments was hydrazine sulfate (646,682), a chemical agent proposed to treat cancer cachexia, the progressive weight loss and debilitation characteristic of advanced cancer. On the basis of animal data and
preliminary human studies conducted in the United States and the Soviet Union (described below), hydrazine sulfate was also claimed to cause tumor regression and subjective improvement in cancer patients. According to one observer (743), hydrazine sulfate was publicized in the news media
as a ""dramatic breakthrough -- bringing people back from the dead."" The American Cancer Society (ACS) published its first ""Unproven Methods"" statement on hydrazine sulfate in 1976 (24). In 1979, however, it was taken off the ACS list of unproven methods, following the
initiation of clinical trials under a new IND exemption (90), although this change was not publicly made until 1982, when the next revised list was published.
While hydrazine sulfate has, in the last few years, been studied by some mainstream researchers, it is still considered as an unconventional treatment. Articles in the popular literature continue to highlight controversial issues in hydrazine sulfate's development (416,549,647).
Proponents argue that the primary emphasis on treating cachexia, rather than the tumor itself, resulted in hydrazine sulfate being not only ignored but maligned by conventional medicine. In a 1988 interview with a Washington Post reporter, the former director of NCI, Vincent DeVita, Jr.,
reinforced this view of why hydrazine sulfate was not received more enthusiastically by the oncologic community:
You have to distinguish between good ideas and bad ideas and ho-hum ideas. And hydrazine, I think, is a ho-hum idea. The key thing is not to prevent people from losing weight while they die; the key thing is to get rid of their cancer, and that was always the issue. The trouble was
nobody saw the value of pumping a lot of resources into a therapy that gave you plumper people by the time they died (767).
The initial proponent of hydrazine sulfate was Joseph Gold, MD, director of the Syracuse Cancer Research Institute in New York. Gold proposed a biochemical mechanism for primary tumor growth and progression and for the development of cachexia (345). He hypothesized that cancer cachexia
results from a systematic energy-losing cycle involving glycolysis in tumor cells and gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, and proposed that an interruption in this metabolic circuit could result in clinical improvement (347). After considering a number of possible agents capable of
interfering with the process, Gold settled on hydrazine sulfate as a likely inhibitor of a key enzyme in the process (348,350).
In 1973, Gold reported on results of experimental animal tests indicating that hydrazine sulfate inhibited the growth of various rodent tumors and potentiated antitumor action of some chemotherapeutic drugs (346). Several groups, including investigators at Calbiochem (a pharmaceutical
company), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Medical College of Virginia, obtained IND exemptions to study the efficacy and safety of hydrazine sulfate in cancer patients. Positive publicity about hydrazine sulfate at a 1974 meeting of the National Health Federation, an
advocacy group for unconventional treatment, led the public to request hydrazine sulfate directly from the company. The FDA later stopped the company from selling it to patients and withdrew all INDs on the agent.
In 1975, Gold reported results of the descriptive study of hydrazine sulfate conducted under Calbiochem's IND (349). Using reports from physicians whose advanced cancer patients were taking hydrazine sulfate, Gold noted several cases of tumor regression and subjective improvement, and
some adverse effects, such as numbness in the extremities and transient nausea. A uncontrolled study conducted in the Soviet Union also reported tumor regression and subjective improvement among patients taking hydrazine sulfate(794). This latter study was followed up with a larger
descriptive study in the Soviet Union that reported some cases of partial regression, stabilization, and subjective improvement (324). In contrast, three small, uncontrolled clinical studies found no evidence of tumor regression among advanced cancer patients taking hydrazine sulfate
(527,690,828).
More recent clinical studies of hydrazine sulfate have examined effects other than antitumor responses. Rowan Chlebowski, MD, PhD, and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have examined the effect of hydrazine sulfate on metabolism and weight loss in
cancer patients. In 1984 and 1987 papers describing biochemical studies, Chlebowski reported that hydrazine sulfate is metabolically active, improves abnormal glucose tolerance, and reduces the increased glucose production rates seen in cancer patients with weight loss (187,849). These
studies did not examine clinical outcomes in patients given hydrazine sulfate.
In a separate study, Chlebowski and colleagues examined the effects of a 30-day hydrazine sulfate treatment regimen on weight, appetite, and caloric intake in cancer patients (185). The study was not designed to measure changes in tumor growth, since indicators of measurable disease
were not required of patients entering the study, and concurrent chemotherapy was permitted. Sixty-one of the patients entered into the study were randomized to hydrazine sulfate or placebo; forty additional patients were assigned hydrazine sulfate and included in the study results.
Approximately half of the patients were evaluable after 30 days, which greatly reduced the actual size of the study. Unfortunately, results from the randomized and nonrandomized groups were combined, and the report does not state how many patients from the randomized group were in the
evaluable group included in the results. Reporting only in percentages, the authors stated that a higher percentage of the patients on hydrazine sulfate maintained or increased their weight, improved their appetite, and increased their caloric intake, suggesting a beneficial effect on
these clinical measures. However, valid judgments about such differences could be drawn only from the randomized data, which were not presented apart from data on the serially treated patients. Nevertheless, the study did provide suggestive evidence that hydrazine sulfate might improve
outcomes in cancer patients with cachexia, suggesting the need for further research.
Stronger evidence of hydrazine sulfate's effects on cancer patients comes from the most recent study reported by Chlebowski and colleagues (186). A randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess changes in nutritional status and survival time as a
result of hydrazine sulfate taken in addition to cisplatin- containing combination chemotherapy. Sixty-five patients with advanced, unresectable (non-operable) non-small-cell lung cancer were randomized to chemotherapy and hydrazine sulfate (oral doses of 60 mg per day) or to chemotherapy
and placebo. These patients had had no prior chemotherapy and were described as being partially or fully ambulatory (performance status 0 to 2). All patients received the same defined nutritional counseling.
Nutritional status was found to be improved in patients taking hydrazine sulfate: they had significantly greater caloric intake and albumin maintenance. In previous studies, a low serum albumin level in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer was found to be predictive of poor survival
time, while maintenance of serum albumin level was found to be significantly predictive of better two-year survival in patients with this type of cancer.
Median survival time among patients in the study was found to be greater among those taking hydrazine sulfate (292 days) than those taking the placebo (197 days), but this difference was not statistically significant. Differences in survival time did reach statistical significance when
the patients were separated into two groups -- approximately 35 patients in relatively better condition (performance status 0 or 1), and approximately 30 patients in more impaired condition (performance status 2). Those patients in better condition who took hydrazine sulfate lived
significantly longer (328 days) than those taking placebo (209 days). Forty-two percent of these patients taking hydrazine sulfate were alive at one year, compared to 18% of those taking placebo. There was no similar increase in median survival for patients in relatively worse condition;
both treatment groups in this case had a median survival of 132 days. Hydrazine sulfate was not found to have a direct antitumor effect on patients in either group. No complete responses were found, and among the partial responses noted, 23% were in patients taking hydrazine, while 29%
were found in patients taking the placebo. These were presumably attributable to the chemotherapy.
Based on the results showing that hydrazine sulfate improved nutritional status in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and increased survival time in the subset of those patients who were more fully ambulatory, the authors suggested that hydrazine sulfate warrants further
evaluation as an adjunct to conventional treatment. As they noted, the modest size of this trial limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from it. The results were sufficiently promising, though, to have recently prompted NCI to sponsor one or more phase III randomized
studies designed to further evaluate the influence of hydrazine sulfate on clinical outcomes in cancer patients (316).
Laetrile
Laetrile is perhaps the best known unconventional cancer treatment of the past two decades. In the mid-1970s, an estimated 70,000 people had used it for cancer treatment, pain control, or cancer prevention (274), and by 1979, 21 States had legalized its use (722). During the same
period, laetrile had become the focus of a political and legal controversy about patients' access to unapproved drugs (see ch. 10) (396,525,578,648,705). Since the early 1980's, laetrile has lost much of its popular appeal, but is currently available at many of the unconventional cancer
clinics in Mexico, used by U.S. patients.
Amygdalin, laetrile, Laetrile (capitalized), sarcarcinase, and nitriloside are some of the names of chemically related substances given to patients as laetrile treatment (903). Proponents have also referred to the treatment as a vitamin (""B-17"") even though it has never been
recognized as such by the scientific community. One of these names, Laetrile, is the tradename for a substance chemically related to amygdalin, a substance found naturally in pits of apricots and other fruits. In this report, the term ""laetrile"" is used to refer generally to this
group of closely related substance(s) used in unconventional cancer treatment. Laetrile was named in reference to its biochemical properties; it was laevorotatory, or left-handed, to polarized light and belonged to the mandelonitrile class of chemicals.
Laetrile was developed from an extract of amygdalin by Ernst Krebs Sr., MD, and Ernst Krebs, Jr., and was first used to treat cancer patients in California in the early 1950's. Its use in the United States, Mexico, and Canada gradually expanded in the 1960s, as various laboratories were
set up to produce and market the substance (985). The popularity of laetrile increased dramatically in the early 1970's when members of the ultraconservative John Birch Society came to the aid of a physician and fellow member who had been arrested for illegally treating patients with
laetrile. Using this case as a starting point, several Birch Society members joined together to found the ""Committee for the Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy,"" primarily to advocate the right of cancer patients to use laetrile (722). Other groups, such as the Cancer Control
Society and the National Health Federation, actively promoted the use and legalization of laetrile (962). With the support of Andrew McNaughton, a Canadian businessman, several factories around the world were built to manufacture laetrile (101).
Some proponents of laetrile cite a theory of cancer etiology known as the ""unitarian"" or ""trophoblastic"" theory as the basis for treating cancer with laetrile. First proposed by John Beard in 1902 and later expanded on by Ernst Krebs, Jr., in the 1940s and 1950s,
that theory draws a connection between cancer cells and trophoblast cells, which are cells present during pregnancy that are thought to protect the fertilized egg from rejection by the woman's immune system. Both cancer cells and the trophoblast cells are described in the trophoblast
theory as invasive, erosive, corrosive, and capable of being carried through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. According to the theory, trophoblast cells could develop at various places in the body from precursor cells distributed throughout the body during embryonic development,
and that these precursor cells could, under certain circumstances, become cancer cells. Laetrile proponents have also proposed that cancer is a deficiency disease caused by a lack of laetrile (""vitamin B-17"") in the diet (362).
When laetrile is subjected to enzymatic breakdown in the body, it breaks down into three chemicals: glucose, benzaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide (545). Various preparations of benzaldehyde have been studied recently, mainly in Japan, for antitumor activity in experimental animals (581)
and in preliminary clinical studies (481,482). Cyanide has well known toxic effects on human cells, both normal and malignant (197).
Laetrile proponents claim that laetrile kills tumor cells selectively, while leaving normal cells alone. In support of this, Ernst Krebs, Jr., hypothesized that normal cells produce an enzyme, beta-glucosidase, that breaks down laetrile, releasing cyanide, which is then converted by a
second enzyme, rhodanese, to the less toxic thiocyanate molecule; cancer cells, however, lack the enzyme rhodanese, according to Krebs' theory, and therefore are killed by the free cyanide (704,903).
In the 1970's, proponents claimed that laetrile had direct antitumor effects, relieved pain associated with advanced cancer, and helped to prevent cancer (903). In recent years, specific claims of antitumor activity of laetrile have rarely been made. Instead, laetrile is more often
discussed in the context of ""metabolic"" regimens, with claims made for antitumor responses and life extension resulting from the use of a combination of treatments, including laetrile, DMSO, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, oxygen treatment, cellular treatment, and other
substances (97,239,576).
Adverse Effects
Since laetrile itself is about 6% cyanide by weight, cyanide toxicity is possible when laetrile is broken down in the body. If an excessive amount of laetrile is ingested, or if something is done to accelerate or increase the release of cyanide from laetrile, then toxic and lethal
levels of cyanide can be reached. B-glucosidase, the enzyme that can markedly accelerate the release of cyanide from laetrile, is found in common foods as such raw almonds, other nuts, bean and alfalfa sprouts, peaches, lettuce, celery, and mushrooms (784). When laetrile is simultaneously
ingested with a source of the B-glucosidase enzyme, toxic cyanide levels may result. Cyanide toxicity has been observed in patients receiving laetrile, although many patients have taken it without showing any significant clinical signs of cyanide toxicity (620,623). Common adverse effects
noted in the studies (described later in this section) by Moertel and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic were nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Isolated reports of deaths due to cyanide poisoning following the ingestion of laetrile have appeared in the literature
(100,585,644,697,768,779,800,811). Samples of Mexican laetrile were examined at NCI for potency, content, and quality of manufacture (248,249). It was found that the measured potency of the samples differed substantially from the labeled potency. In addition, of approximately 1500 ampules
that were examined visually, about 400 contained particulate matter, and 20 showed microbial growth (primarily budding yeast and fungal hyphae), indicating contamination of the material. These contaminants pose additional risks of complications, especially when given intravenously to
patients who may be immunosuppressed. Bradford and colleagues at the American Biologics clinic in Tijuana have noted the existence of ""pure"" and ""decomposed and degraded"" products sold as laetrile or amygdalin (97).
Attempts at Evaluating Laetrile
Since the 1950s, laetrile has been examined for antitumor activity in a variety of experimental test systems. Its use in cancer patients has also been described by several proponents and it has been the subject of clinical trials sponsored by NCI. These efforts are summarized below.
Animal Studies
Laetrile has been tested for antitumor activity in a variety of transplanted rodent tumor systems. Experiments were conducted in several different laboratories under NCI sponsorship in 1957, 1960, 1969 (twice), and 1973, testing the effects of laetrile alone or in combination with beta
glucosidase. These experiments used several different sources of laetrile and a variety of transplanted rodent tumor systems, and in each case, no antitumor activity was found (906). Other investigators have tested laetrile alone (183,404,838) or laetrile with beta glucosidase (519,965) in
transplanted rodent tests. No antitumor activity has been found in any of these experiments.
Laetrile alone and in combination with beta glucosidase has also been tested for antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts in athymic (nude) mice. Using MX-1 mammary or CX-2 colon tumor xenografts in these mice, no antitumor effects of laetrile with or without the enzyme were found
(701).
Spontaneous animal tumor systems have also been used in a variety of tests involving laetrile. In a study often cited in the proponent literature, Harold Manner and colleagues (575) treated mice that had spontaneous mammary tumors with the following three agents, tested individually and
in various combinations: laetrile (50 mg/kg body weight per day injected intramuscularly), vitamin A (333,333 IU/kg body weight per day administered via stomach tube), and digestive enzymes (10 mg injected every other day ""directly into and around the tumor mass""). The animals
were observed for signs of tumor regression during a 30-day period of treatment.
According to the published report, no tumor regressions were observed in the animals treated with laetrile alone, vitamin A alone, or laetrile and vitamin A in combination. Tumor regressions were observed in the four treatment groups receiving the digestive enzymes (and a few in the
control groups); in these animals, ulcerations containing necrotic malignant cells in viscous fluid were found at the tumor sites. Fifty-two percent or more of the tumors regressed in the groups treated with enzymes alone, enzymes and vitamin A in combination, enzymes and laetrile in
combination, or enzymes, vitamin A, and laetrile in combination. The highest percentage was found in the latter group, in which all three treatments were given. The authors concluded that laetrile given alone is ""not effective in tumor regression"" but that when all three are
given at the same time, ""76% of the tumors do completely regress."" It appears from the results, however, that the main effect observed was the immediate proteolytic effect of injecting digestive enzymes directly into tumor masses.
The largest and most complex set of tests on laetrile in animals was described by Chester Stock and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens (837). One of the investigators at Sloan-Kettering, Kanematsu Sugiura, conducted
six initial experiments using CD8F1 mice with spontaneous mammary tumors, and found that the mice treated with laetrile showed no significant prevention of growth of primary tumors, but did show inhibition in the development of lung metastases. In an unusual sequence of events,
unauthorized information about these experiments was made public before the results were confirmed independently, leading to allegations by proponents that ""proof"" of laetrile's effectiveness had been obtained and then suppressed by the Sloan-Kettering researchers (240,648,813).
These experiments were followed by a series of five experiments designed to replicate Sugiura's initial experiments. In two blinded experiments, the assessment of tumor status was done in such a way that the observer did not know whether the mice had had laetrile or the control
treatment. This was intended to address the issue of unintentional bias in observing the presence of metastases, since the two methods that Sugiura used to detect metastases -- gross observation and microscopic analysis -- were reported to be inherently subjective, while another method he
did not use, bioassay, was reported to be less subject to bias. These independent and blind experiments (including those Sugiura participated in) did not confirm Sugiura's initial results. The authors concluded that in the spontaneous animal tumor system, ""laetrile was found to
possess neither preventive, nor tumor-regressant, nor antimetastatic, nor curative anticancer activity.""
The report summarizing both Sugiura's work and the independent experiments (on which Sugiura was a coauthor) noted that Sugiura believed his initial results were valid and that laetrile had antimetastatic activity. In an addendum to the paper, Daniel Martin, Chester Stock, and Robert
Good added that the negative results of the blind experiments suggested that Sugiura's initial experiments were unknowingly biased, and reiterated their conclusion that laetrile had ""no action against the formation of metastases in the spontaneous tumor system.""
Human Studies
From the 1950s until the late 1970s, laetrile was reported to have been used widely, not only in the United States, but also in Europe, Mexico, and elsewhere. Descriptions by practitioners of its use in cancer patients appeared in various books and journals. These include a 1962 book by
Howard Beard on the trophoblastic theory of cancer (381), a 1962 report in a U.S. medical journal written by a New Jersey surgeon (643), numerous reports by a physician in the Philippines (e.g., (662)), an abstract and presentation by practitioners in Italy and Belgium (765), papers by
Dean Burk and Hans Nieper (e.g., (110)), and a 1977 book describing patients treated at a California clinic (758). None of these reports describes controlled, prospective trials from which valid judgments of laetrile's effects could be made. They were probably influential in increasing the
popularity of the drug, however, since they all reported good results believed to be specifically related to laetrile.
In the mid-1970s, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) attempted to obtain documented evidence of objective responses to laetrile, using an approach designed to collect information from the records of people who themselves claimed, or whose practitioners claimed, had been treated
successfully. The intention was not to try to estimate possible rates of effectiveness, or to document adverse effects.
Retrospective Review of Cases
NCI sent nearly half a million letters to physicians, other health professionals, and pro-laetrile groups, asking for documented case histories of patients who had shown objective responses to laetrile (274). Consent of the patient or next of kin, confirmatory histologic material,
measurable disease, adequately documented history, use of laetrile with or without metabolic treatment for a period of at least 30 days, with at least a 30-day period preceding during which no conventional cancer treatment was given, and records in English were required for cases
submitted. Supporting information for each submitted case was sought from physicians, clinics, hospitals, and laboratories.
The solicitation and review of the public record resulted in identifying 230 patients with claimed objective responses from laetrile, all of whom (or the next-of-kin) were asked to authorize release of their medical records. Ninety-three gave permission, and after assembling the records
for all cases, 26 were found to be insufficient for review (many because requested records were not sent). The review was based on the 67 remaining laetrile-treated cases (one of whom had two separate courses of laetrile). In an attempt to avoid personal biases against laetrile in the
evaluation, 26 case histories of patients with similar disease who received conventional treatment, but not laetrile, were pulled from the NCI files, and added to the laetrile cases. A summary of the clinical course of each of the 93 cases, without specifying whether the patient had or had
not received laetrile, was presented to a panel of 12 expert clinical oncologists from outside NCI for their independent review. A group consensus was then reached after discussing the results of the individual reviews.
By consensus, there were two complete remissions, four partial remissions, nine cases of stable disease, and seven cases of progressive disease. Thirty-five cases were non- evaluable, meaning that they did not meet original criteria for cases, and 11 had insufficient data on which to
judge response. Of the patients from the NCI files who had not had laetrile, one, who had not had any treatment, was judged to have had a partial response.
Despite attempts to blind the panelists to whether the patients had had laetrile, a higher-than-expected proportion answered correctly when asked to guess whether patients had had laetrile or other treatment. However, the consensus for the six laetrile-treated patients determined to
have had partial or complete responses, and three determined to have had an increased disease-free survival, was that they had received conventional chemotherapy.
The discussion in the report of that review illustrates the difficulty in interpreting results such as these. The authors make a number of useful points. First, the rather small number of cases submitted in relation to the solicitation effort, and the loss of cases due to sources not
submitting requested information, left a relatively small number of evaluable cases. It is unclear what NCI could have done differently to increase the number of cases submitted. The authors also commented that cases rejected from the review as inevaluable were not necessarily examples of
poor medical management or of patients who may not have benefited from laetrile. The necessary rigor of NCI's process alone determined their evaluability. A natural tendency is to want to compute a ""response rate"" using these data, but, in fact, there is no valid means to do so,
therefore these data cannot be summarized in a meaningful statistical sense.
A number of explanations for the six cases determined to have benefited after laetrile treatment are offered in the published report. First, it is possible that the patients responded to laetrile, but in this type of study, that explanation cannot be assumed true:
Submission of incorrect clinical interpretations, falsified data, intentional or unintentional omission of data (for example, concurrent conventional therapy), the possibility that we were unaware of some physicians treating these patients or non-response to our inquiries must all be
considered in interpreting these findings....Spontaneous regressions of tumors, although rare, have been documented...with frequency varying according to tumor type. Even in the absence of true spontaneous regression, the well documented variability in the natural history of some tumors
may confuse interpretation (904) and, in fact, the panel judged by consensus that a partial response occurred in one patient receiving no treatment during the course evaluated. The patients treated with Laetrile were almost always given concomitant metabolic therapy...as well as general
supportive-care measures such as improved diet, psychologic support and the unmeasurable ingredient of hope. This fact makes it difficult to attribute any tumor responses to Laetrile alone.
The authors suggested, however, that the data would be used by NCI in determining if further study is needed. A prospective trial, described below, was conducted following the case review.
Phase I and II Clinical Trials
After the laetrile case review described above, NCI sponsored phase I and II clinical trials, which were carried out at the Mayo Clinic. In the phase I study (620), information about dosage and toxicity was gathered in preparation for the phase II study (623), which is described here.
One hundred seventy-eight patients with advanced cancers were treated with amygdalin, according to a regimen ""representative of current Laetrile practice,"" and were prescribed a diet and vitamin supplements designed by the investigators to be similar to metabolic regimens offered
by many laetrile practitioners. A subgroup (14 patients with colorectal cancer) was given a high-dose regimen of both amygdalin and supplements, resembling high-dose regimens used by some laetrile practitioners.
About a third of the patients had colorectal cancer, the next largest categories being lung, breast, and melanoma, with rare cancers represented by fewer patients. All patients had disease for which no conventional treatment was available, though none was bedridden and all were able to
eat normally. Most of the patients were capable of working at least part time. About a third of the patients had had no chemotherapy at all. This is of interest because some metabolic practitioners claim that laetrile and metabolic therapy are more effective in patients whose immune
systems have not been damaged by chemotherapy.
The amygdalin was prepared by NCI from apricot pits, corresponding to the laetrile sold by major suppliers to U.S. patients. It was administered intravenously for 21 days, followed by continued oral dosage, and stopped with progression of the cancer or severe ""clinical
deterioration."" Amygdalin was also stopped if an extremely high blood cyanide level was reached (3 micrograms per milliliter); this was the case for three patients.
Standard criteria were used to assess patient response. An ""objective response"" had to meet the following three conditions: 1) at least a 50% decrease in a particular measurement of the most clearly measurable tumor area of an originally chosen ""indicator lesion"" (or
if malignant enlarged liver were the measurable disease, a 30% decrease in a particular measurement); 2) no increase in the size of other areas of malignant disease; and 3) no new areas of malignant disease. Two criteria had to be met to be classified as in ""stable condition:"" 1)
less than 50% decrease in the measurement referred to above in the first criterion for an objective response; and 2) no new areas of malignant disease. Meeting any one of three criteria constituted ""objective progression:"" 1) an increase of more than 25% in any indicator lesion;
2) new areas of malignant disease; or 3) severe clinical deterioration precluding further therapy and observation.
The study found that one of the 175 evaluable patients met the criteria for a partial response (at least 50% decrease in size, but not disappearance of lesion), and that response was transient. More than half of the patients had measurable progression at the end of the three-week
intravenous amygdalin course. By the end of two months, about 80% had measurable disease, and by seven months, all patients had progressed. The median survival (the point after starting treatment at which half the patients had died) was 4.8 months. The 14 high-dose patients were similar in
these outcomes to the entire group.
There was little evidence in this trial population of symptomatic relief. Few people gained weight, and improvements in performance status for those originally impaired were few. Twenty percent of patients claimed some symptomatic benefit at some point during treatment, but this was
generally short-lived. After 10 weeks, 5% of patients reported still receiving benefit.
Toxicities were generally mild when patients adhered strictly to the treatment schedules. Typical symptoms of cyanide toxicity -- nausea, vomiting, headache, and mental dullness -- occurred in some cases, particularly when patients took more amygdalin during a specified time period than
was prescribed (e.g., when a dose was missed, and the patient ""made it up"").
The authors stated that survival times of patients in the trial ""appear to be consistent with the anticipated survivals in comparable patients receiving inactive treatment or no treatment."" When challenged on this point in a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine (709), the investigators compared the survival curve of colorectal cancer patients in the trial to survival of colorectal patients who had received new chemotherapeutic agents at the Mayo Clinic, and found no difference (619). The study was not designed, however, to determine if
amygdalin causes moderate increases in lifespan (or improvements in wellbeing or pain control), since it did not include a randomized control group, and thus the author's comparison is not entirely valid.
The study was criticized by laetrile supporters, who claimed that the material NCI used was not ""Laetrile,"" but in fact, a ""degraded product"" (237). However, the NCI product was prepared to correspond to one of several popular formulations being administered to U.S.
patients at the time, and the regimen used in the study did reflect then current practices of proponents. If the treatment had the antitumor activity claimed for it, a substantial number of patients in this trial should have shown objective responses. As it turned out, only one out of 175
patients studied showed a response -- a partial, transient tumor response -- which was far below expectations based on proponents' claims of laetrile's efficacy.
The Livingston-Wheeler Regimen
More than 40 years ago, the late Virginia (Wuerthele Casp,) Livingston-Wheeler, M.D., reported that she identified a specific microorganism she believed was associated with the development and progression of cancer. [Officially, she used the name Virginia C. Livingston, M.D. Dr.
Livingston died shortly before this OTA Report was finished.] During the 1950s, she developed a comprehensive theory of cancer causation based on this common infective agent and designed a corresponding antiinfective treatment -- an autogenous vaccine designed to treat and prevent
infection with the microbe that she believed causes cancer. The current treatment regimen, offered at an outpatient clinic in San Diego, includes a variety of components intended to bolster patients' immune responses in general and to counteract effects of microbial infection. These
components, which have changed over time, include antibiotics, vitamin and mineral supplements, and a special diet.
The Livingston-Wheeler treatment was added to the ACS list of unproven methods in 1968 (23). In Feb., 1990, Livingston was issued a cease and desist order by the California Department of Health Services to stop prescribing and administering the autogenous vaccine as part of her
treatment regimen (831). The Department found that the use of the vaccine by the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic violated California's Health and Safety Code, which ""prohibits the sale, providing, or prescribing of any cancer drug, medicine, compound, or device unless it has been
scientifically proven to be safe and effective in the diagnosis, treatment, alleviation, or cure of cancer and an application therefore has been approved by the Department or the United States Food and Drug Administration.""
After receiving her M.D. from New York University in 1936, Dr. Livingston held a number of academic, clinical, and laboratory positions, including associate professor in the Bureau of Biological Research at Rutgers University and associate professor of microbiology at the University of
San Diego (563). In 1969, she established the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic, where she was director, and began treating cancer patients on a full-time basis. Livingston was one of the most widely known practitioners of unconventional cancer treatment in the United States. Since her death, the
clinic has been called the Livingston Medical Center.
Livingston's hypothesis on the role of infectious agents in the etiology of cancer originated from her work in the mid- 1940s on scleroderma, a systemic, autoimmune connective tissue disorder. Comparing tuberculosis, leprosy, scleroderma, and cancer, she noted that ""all four
diseases are characterized by a simultaneous process of production and destruction of tissue and by a progressive, systemic involvement of the host"" (971). She redirected her research from the bacteriology of scleroderma to that of cancer, beginning with tissue from a patient with
breast cancer.
In a paper published in 1950 (973), Livingston reported on a group of microorganisms that she isolated from tumor tissue. She referred to these organisms as a single culture and described the various forms in which they appeared: ""minute filterable granules beyond the limits of
visibility of the light microscope,"" ""larger granules approximately the size of ordinary cocci readily seen with the light microscope,"" ""globoidal forms,"" ""rod-like forms with irregular staining,"" and ""globoidal forms which appear to undergo polar
budding."" She reported that she did not find these forms in the tissues of healthy individuals, and suggested that this organism might be of primary or secondary importance in the etiology of cancer.
Although admittedly not the first to culture microorganisms from tumor cells, Livingston believed that she was the first to postulate interrelationships among the observed bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma. To do this, she examined the ""developmental cycle of the organism through
each transitional phase"" using specific growth media, differential staining, high power microscopic resolution, and electron microscopy. She concluded that these phases represented different developmental forms of the same microorganism (974), which she characterized as ""pleomorphic,""
a term used in microbiology to refer to bacteria that change in size and shape during their life cycle (also called ""cell wall deficient"" bacteria) (584). She reported that these different forms included micrococci, diphtheroids, bacilli, fungi, viruses, and host-cell inclusions
(977). In 1970, Livingston proposed a formal classification for this microbe and described her method for isolating and culturing it (978). She classified it under the order Actinomycetales, which includes the bacteria associated with tuberculosis and leprosy, and named her microbe
Progenitor cryptocides (PC), meaning ""the ancestral, or primordial, hidden killer"" (563).
Livingston believed that P. cryptocides is ubiquitous in patients with cancer and, contrary to her earlier observation, that it is also present in some individuals without apparent disease (560). She believed that in a healthy person, this microbe is maintained at low levels in the
body, but under some conditions, it can multiply in overwhelming numbers and become invasive and tumor-promoting (978). Special staining methods were developed by Livingston and her colleagues to determine the degree of latent or overt infection, an indicator that she used to determine the
progress of the disease during treatment (979).
To examine their potential for causing disease, Livingston inoculated mice and guinea pigs with cultures of P. cryptocides and reported a ""wide range of neoplastic tissue changes"" in the inoculated animals (972,978). These results were confirmed by Irene Diller at the
Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia (255,256). On the basis of these experiments, Livingston concluded that P. cryptocides was pathogenic in animals, and extrapolated this pathogenicity to humans. She believed that P. cryptocides is the ""primary etiologic agent in
proliferative and degenerative diseases"" (977) and claims that her work proves it to be the causative agent in all cancers. In the absence of clinical studies examining the possible role that Progenitor cryptocides might play in the development of cancer, however, the pathogenicity of
this microbe or group of microbes in humans remains unresolved.
There is little support, outside of a few researchers (see, e.g., (106)) for Livingston's belief that the different microbes observed in tissues and blood of cancer patients are actually different forms of the same organism. At present, no independent evidence exists to corroborate her
contention that the microbial forms are related to each other as different forms of a single, pleomorphic organism. Evidence does show that the bacterial culture Livingston isolated is not a new and unique species as claimed: P. cryptocides cultures supplied by Livingston were identified
as different species of the genus Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (3,4,258). The issue of isolating bacteria of any kind from tumor tissue and urine of cancer patients, however, is generally not disputed, since many groups of researchers have reported isolating various species and strains
of bacteria from such sources (see, e.g., (3,62,209)). Some of these bacteria have also been shown to undergo morphologic alterations characteristic of cell wall deficient (or pleomorphic) bacteria (4). Acevedo and others have looked into the effect that these organisms might have on the
body's immune response to malignant cells (4).
During the course of her research into the properties of P. cryptocides, Livingston discovered that this microbial culture produces a substance in vitro that is closely related to the human hormone chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (980). [Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone secreted
in pregnancy by the trophoblast cells that form the outer part of the embryo and allow implantation. In early pregnancy, this hormone plays a role in maintaining the lining of the uterus and in preventing spontaneous abortion of the fetus.] Her report was the first to document the
production of a mammalian hormone-like substance by microorganisms, and this has been confirmed by other investigators (209,580). Others have observed that a protein similar to hCG produced in vivo by a variety of microorganisms (5). The hormone has been found in tumor tissue isolated from
cancer patients, though not from every species of bacteria isolated from cancer patients; it has also been found in bacterial isolates from individuals without clinical manifestations of cancer (3). These findings suggest that the production of a chorionic gonadotropin-like substance by
human tissues or microorganisms is not uniquely associated with cancer, although they do not rule out a possible role for the hormone in the development of some cancers. Researchers have suggested the possibility that chorionic gonadotropin, whether produced by human cells (691) or by
bacterially- infected human tumor tissue, may suppress certain immune responses (517), and that substances acting against hCG may inhibit the growth of malignant cells (471).
Livingston believed that P. cryptocides is ""an essential but dormant part of all cells,"" and is normally kept in check by a fully functional immune system. She believed that ""when immunity is suppressed or weakened, P. cryptocides proliferate and allow cancer to gain a
foothold, secreting the same (chorionic gonadotropin) hormone found in abundance in all tumors."" She viewed cancer as an ""immune deficiency disease"" caused by specific inadequacies in the diet and by toxic chemicals in the environment. She stated in her 1984 book, ""the
modern diet is simply deficient in providing the nutrition essentials that maintain a healthy, vital immunity to cancer...what we put in our mouths either causes or directly contributes to the onset of cancer through the depression of our immunity"" (563).
Possible treatment approaches for cancer based on her theory of cancer causation were discussed for the first time in a paper Livingston published in 1965 (977). In that paper, she reported treating 40 patients with a regimen that included an autogenous vaccine -- one made from each
patient's culture of P. cryptocides. The vaccine was designed to promote the production of immunologic cells, to suppress the invading microorganism, and to promote host resistance. Other components of the treatment include laxatives, cleansing enemas, and a special diet low in
carbohydrates and high in well-cooked proteins, fresh fruits, raw vegetables, and vitamin and mineral supplements. That paper described how the vaccine was made and administered to cancer patients, although clinical details about the patients, such as tumor type, previous treatment, or
outcome, were not provided; it was noted only that, following vaccine treatment, ""a number of these patients appear to be improving."" Livingston did not publish any other papers in the medical literature presenting data on tumor regression or life extension in cancer patients
treated with her regimen. At present, other information about the treatment consists of the materials available from the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic (a patient brochure, a physician handbook, and a compendium of published research papers by Livingston and some of her colleagues), and two
books written for a general audience (Cancer: A New Breakthrough (975) and The Conquest of Cancer (563)). The Conquest of Cancer contains case history summaries of patients treated at the clinic (see discussion below).
Livingston stated in a deposition (559) that her treatment does not interfere with conventional treatment and can be used adjunctively (559). She stated in her book, however, that she preferred that patients avoid conventional treatment before starting her regimen, since, as she
explained it, ""often they come to us after having been so heavily treated that their immune systems are all but destroyed, and their tumors are far advanced"" (563).
Treatment Regimen
The treatment regimen (as of July 1990, before Dr. Livingston's death) used at the clinic included a number of different immunologic, pharmacologic, and nutritional components.
Before the 1990 ""cease and desist"" order was issued (see above), the autogenous vaccine was administered to all patients. The vaccine was intended to eliminate P. cryptocides from the body and was made from each patient's own culture of microorganisms, which were isolated from
urine. In the initial treatment period, each patient was supplied with enough vaccine for 9 to 12 months. Thereafter, new cultures were obtained periodically for the production of new vaccines, so that the treatment continued to correspond to any changes in the patient's P. cryptocides
levels as treatment progressed (559). Gradually, the frequency of autogenous vaccine administration was decreased and eventually, only occasional booster shots were given. Livingston also gave a ""purified antigen"" vaccine made at the clinic, consisting of a cell wall extract of a
general P. cryptocides culture (562).
Other immunologic treatments included in the regimen are mixed bacterial vaccines, antibiotics, and various commercially prepared nonspecific immune stimulators, such as levamisole (a conventional antiparasitic agent also used as an immune stimulant and recently shown effective in
treating patients with colon cancer), and tuftsin (an experimental agent noted for various immune stimulating properties). The bacillus Calmette-Gu,rin (BCG) vaccine, a vaccine that immunizes against tuberculosis used as a general immunologic stimulant in some conventional cancer
treatment, is also used in many cases. Other treatments are offered on a case by case basis.
Progress in reducing infection with P. cryptocides is monitored by examining smears of a patient's blood under a darkfield microscope, an uncommon type of microscope that Livingston believed a key to identifying P. cryptocides microbes. A decrease or increase in the number of visible
Progenitor cryptocides microbes in the blood smear is used to indicate increasing or decreasing immune response as a result of treatment. Other tests are also used to assess immune response and progress of treatment (563).
Another component of the regimen is the provision of fresh, whole-blood transfusions from a young, healthy person (preferably a family member), and injections of gamma globulin to increase the number of circulating antibodies. Livingston also used a ""custom formula,""
consisting of an extract of sheep liver and spleen, to ""increase the white blood count [and] enhance immunogenic systems."" Other immunologic agents that may be used include T-cells, thymosin (a hormone-like factor extracted from calf thymus), interferon, and tumor necrosis
factor.
Livingston recommended that patients follow specific nutritional guidelines. The recommended diet emphasizes ""living food"" -- whole grains, fresh vegetables, and fruits. She strongly encouraged patients to stop smoking and to eliminate meat and poultry products, alcohol,
coffee, refined sugars, and processed foods from their diets. Also included is a nutritional supplementation program, consisting of high doses of vitamins (especially vitamins A, B-6, B-12, and C), minerals, digestive enzymes, and bile salts.
Another component of the regimen is bowel hygiene and detoxification. Livingston stated that frequent enemas, and sometimes high colonics, are necessary to cleanse the intestinal tract of pathogenic bacteria and toxic materials. She stated also that they help relieve pain and improve
appetite and digestion. Daily coffee enemas may be recommended.
In this regimen, emphasis is placed on the use of abscisic acid, a plant hormone (Dormin) and vitamin A analog that Livingston believed neutralizes chorionic gonadotropin in the blood and urine. She stated that abscisic acid is normally produced in the human liver, unless its function
is impaired (561,976). This claim has apparently not been examined independently by researchers unaffiliated with Livingston.
There have been no reports in the literature of direct adverse effects from the Livingston regimen. There are some potential risks, however. As with any injection into the body of a foreign substance, the injection of the autogenous vaccine carries the associated risk of sepsis or
anaphylaxis. Some risk of contamination in the preparation of the material is also possible, depending on the processes and procedures used to make and assure the sterility of the vaccines manufactured at the clinic. In addition, in any setting, the use of whole blood transfusion, even
with directed donors' blood, carries a small risk of transmitting various infectious agents. Livingston's ""custom formula,"" consisting of an extract of sheep liver and spleen, carries certain risks associated with all types of cellular treatment (see discussion of cellular
treatment earlier in this chapter).
Claims of Efficacy
Livingston claimed that her treatment regimen is capable of curing cancer by stimulating the immune system. In support of this claim, she presented in her book, The Conquest of Cancer, a summary of clinical outcomes of patients treated at her clinic. According to Livingston,
""someone not employed by our clinic drew 100 charts from our files totally at random,"" which Livingston then evaluated. Sixty- two of these were considered evaluable by Livingston's criteria: she excluded patients whose records lacked confirmed pathology reports, who discontinued
the Livingston-Wheeler treatment, who were ""too weak and ill to carry out the program,"" and ""who had only recently checked into the clinic, or whose cases were so recent that even the dramatically fast reversals could only be labeled inconclusive."" Patients who received
previous or concurrent conventional treatment were not excluded.
Livingston concluded from her review that ""our success rate has been 82%"" and ""considering the patients we called inconclusive but for whom we were able to be of some help, it is over 90%,"" although there was no discussion of which cases were included in these
percentages and for what reasons. She did not define what she meant by ""success"" or being of ""some help."" Regarding the 18% that she did not consider successful, she stated that she ""probably could have helped these patients had they not come to us with enormously
debilitated immune systems resulting from having already undergone massive chemotherapy and radiation.""
The conditions of some of the patients in this review may or may not have improved as a result of Livingston's treatment, but the data presented in her book on this group of self- selected patients do not support calculation of an overall ""success rate."" Insufficient
information is presented on the clinical course of these patients for readers to arrive at independent judgments about the treatment's usefulness and the complete, original patient data have not been examined by outside researchers.
At present, there is insufficient information to indicate whether this regimen is or is not effective in treating cancer. However, Livingston's ideas have stimulated other researchers to study some aspects of her cancer treatment regimen. For example, Anthony Strelkauskas, M.D., at the
University of South Carolina, is reportedly studying the immune responses of breast cancer patients to the autogenous vaccine, but results have not yet been published (559).
A prospective clinical trial of the use of an autogenous vaccine in the treatment of cancer is currently underway in Virginia under the direction of Vincent Speckhart, M.D., and Alva Johnson, Ph.D. (819). The aim of the evaluation is to observe tumor responses following vaccine
administration among 33 patients described as having advanced forms of cancer and as either failing previous treatment or having recurrences following conventional treatment. For a six- month period, patients were given regular doses of an autogenous vaccine prepared from cultures of
chorionic gonadotropin-producing bacteria isolated from the patients' urine (820). According to a summary of preliminary results (a full description is not yet available), the study found several cases of tumor regression, some complete and some partial, in this group of patients. No
adverse reactions, except localized redness and an occasional rash that were resolved by changing the vaccine dose, were noted. Speckhart and Johnson's full results may contribute information to the further evaluation of the efficacy of such vaccines in cancer treatment.
Hans Nieper
Another widely known practitioner of unconventional cancer treatment is Hans
Nieper, MD, a West German physician. Patients from many countries, including the United States, reportedly have sought his treatment. Nieper specializes in the treatment of cancer, multiple sclerosis, and heart
disease (77). For cancer, Nieper prescribes a combination of conventional and unconventional agents (including pharmaceutical drugs, vitamins, minerals, and animal and plant extracts), and recommends that patients follow a special diet and avoid particular physical agents, foods, and
physical locations (""geopathogenic zones"") that he believes are damaging. [Website Owner Side Note: In 1994, the FDA banned importation of Nieper products. Nieper died on October
21, 1998.]
Since 1964, Nieper has been affiliated with the Paracelsus Silbersee Hospital in Hannover, West Germany. He received his MD from the University of Hamburg in 1953 (77). In addition to his medical practice and clinical research, Nieper hypothesizes about some aspects of theoretical
physics. His writings cover subjects such as the ""shielding theory of gravity"" and the potential for harnessing useful energy from space, which he refers to as the ""tachyon field."" Some of his ideas about problems in medicine, including some aspects of cancer etiology
and treatment, are based on his theories of energy fields (677).
Nieper has published a large number of papers and books on medical subjects, in several languages, according to information from the Admiral Ruge Archives, A. Keith Brewer Science Library, Richland Center, Wisconsin, a private library that collects and distributes some of Nieper's
papers in the United States. These papers, some of which are translated from German, are distributed by that library as mimeographed typescripts, with a title, Nieper's name as author, and a date; although in all but a few papers, no source or citation is given to indicate whether they
correspond to published articles. Using indexes to the open medical literature accessible in the United States (e.g., Index Medicus and Science Citation Index), OTA found citations to a small number of articles by Nieper, only a few in English (675).
In 1985, an English translation of his book Revolution in Technology, Medicine and Society was published (677). This book contains discussions (often difficult to follow) of his theories and research interests (titled, e.g., ""On the Subject of Medicine and the Tachyon Era,""
""The Symposium on Energy Technology in Hannover,"" ""Congress on Gravity Field Energy in Toronto,"" ""Epilog for the Hannover and Toronto Energy Conferences,"" and ""Encouraging signs in Politics, Economy, and Intellectual Leadership""). Within the context
of these subjects, Nieper discusses approaches to the treatment of cancer, multiple sclerosis, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, lupus, asthma, heart disease, and a variety of other conditions.
Nieper's book and mimeographed papers cover a range of issues in cancer prevention and treatment and also discuss particular treatments that he believes are important. Although he states that his ideas are based on clinical and laboratory data, he does not explain them in the context of
other available medical literature. Rather, he discusses his approaches to treatment in the context of theories and conclusions derived from his general knowledge of medical research. The lack of straightforward descriptions of his treatment approaches and of citations to existing medical
literature make it difficult, at best, to determine the components of his treatment regimens and the specific information (including his data and others') on which they are based.
Nieper offers additional information about his treatments in the course of occasional seminars and workshops in the United States, which are sponsored by the Hans Nieper Foundation, an information and support group based in California and directed by a former patient. At a 1987 full day
seminar for medical professionals, held in New York, Nieper discussed his protocols for the treatment of cancer and multiple sclerosis (453), for example. There is virtually no other available information intended for a U.S. audience on Nieper's treatment regimens from Nieper or his
supporters.
Thus far, government and private organizations in the United States have not provided synopses of Nieper's treatment, as has been done for a variety of other unconventional cancer treatments that U.S. cancer patients use. No written statements about Nieper are available from the Cancer
Information Service (NCI) or the Committee on Unproven Methods (ACS). One aspect of Nieper's treatment was addressed in a 1986 FDA ""talk paper"" (890) on the issue of importation of Nieper's treatment materials. In 1987, FDA issued an import alert (891), announcing that shipments
of drugs prescribed by Nieper would be detained by U.S. Customs agents. FDA considers the shipment of these drugs into the United States to be in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, since they lack U.S. approval for use and are not labeled according to standards set forth in
that law.
Based on the book and mimeographed papers referred to above, some aspects of Nieper's treatment for cancer can be described. Nieper describes his approach to treatment as ""eumetabolic,"" a term he coined to refer to the use of substances derived from plants or animals that he
considers not to be ""foreign"" in the human body. The regimen for cancer includes ""subtoxic doses of chemotherapy,"" ""hormone therapy,"" and ""gene-repair therapy;"" the components and rationale for them are only indirectly and partially described. The
overall aim of the cancer treatment regimen is to activate the ""internal defense system,"" which Nieper believes is the body's own mechanism for fighting cancer. He uses low-dose chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to kill or remove tumor cells directly, but cautions that
chemotherapy ""must never be so extensive that valuable mechanisms of the body's own defenses are thoughtlessly damaged"" (677). Nieper believes that internal mechanisms control the healing process in cancer; ""exogenous factors and procedures have, therefore, little effect
on...the incidence...and the curing rate"" (676). Nieper believes that cancer is caused by suppression of natural host defenses, by overeating the wrong types of foods, and by exposure to certain types of environmental factors. He refers to particular environmental factors that he
believes lead to ""gene instabilities"" and to the activation of oncogenes: X- rays, ultraviolet radiation, alternating current electrical fields, and the ""tachyon field turbulence of the geopathic zone.""
In Nieper's view, geopathic zones ""play a decisive role in the development of cancer cells and cancerous tumors"" (677), in that he believes there is a higher incidence of cancer in areas of high levels of earth radiation and in areas situated over subterranean water veins. He
believes that geopathic zones cause disturbances in the magnetic or electrostatic properties of tissues in the body, which disrupt the genetic material. Nieper claims that 92% of cancer cases he has examined are associated with long- term occupancy (particularly where the individuals
sleep) of geopathic zones. He believes that ""removal of cancer- stricken patients from geopathic zones absolutely belongs to the conscientious duties of an oncologist"" (677).
Nieper states that his treatment regimen is ""more or less the same in all conditions of malignancy whatever the finding"" (673). A wide range of substances used to treat cancer patients is discussed in his writings, including dehydroepiandrosterone, magnesium, selenium, beta
carotene, bromelaine (papain), cod liver oil capsules, vitamin C, photons, BCG, gamma globulin, magnesium orotate, tumosterone, mistletoe, amygdalin and mandelonitriles (laetrile), benzaldehyde, urea, glutathione, Didrouvaltrate, carnivora (an extract of the Dioneaea muscipula plant), pau
d'arco, ""adrenal whole extract,"" and squalene (derived from shark's liver oil) (676).
In addition to prescribing some or all of these agents, Nieper cautions patients to avoid alternating current fields, such as electric blankets and heating pads, and to avoid all cigarette smoke. He recommends that they follow a special diet -- a low-salt, low-carbohydrate, ""Kirlian-
positive vegetarian diet,"" including whole grain cereals and breads, carrot juice with heavy cream, vegetable and fruit juices, low-fat milk, all types of vegetables and fruits, moderate amounts of coffee, tea, eggs, and butter, and limited amounts of fish. Patients are cautioned to
avoid most types of meat, sausage, chicken, veal, shellfish, sugar, alcohol (except ""sour"" wine), white bread, cheese, vitamin B12, and iron (167).
The information available about Nieper's treatment regimen contains very little clinical data on outcomes in cancer patients following treatment. A mimeographed paper dated 1977 and a 1980 paper with the same information show a table listing 23 general tumor types found in 214 patients,
along with the number of patients with each tumor type and the number of ""positive responses"" to his treatment. A ""positive response"" was defined as ""18-month survival with considerably improved health."" Nieper claims that ""the percentage of patients
whose disease gets under control within an 18-month period of observation is close to 40%"" but he restricts this to ""mobile, so-called incurable patients,"" because ""the results with hospitalized patients are less than half as good since hospitalization indicates that
the disease has progressed too far"" (674,675). Since no data are given on tumor stage, prior treatment, specific treatments given to patients under his regimen, or how these particular patients were chosen for inclusion in the analysis, the information provided is insufficient to draw
any conclusions about efficacy.
Oxygen Treatments
Various types of oxidizing agents are discussed in the popular literature on unconventional cancer treatments and at meetings sponsored by advocacy and information groups such as the Cancer Control Society (162). Although not apparently widespread in the United States, the use of
oxidizing agents has been reported at clinics in Mexico and West Germany where U.S. cancer patients are treated (289,588). The most commonly mentioned treatments of this type are ozone (a gas), hydrogen peroxide (a liquid), antioxidant enzymes, and related products (853). Oxidizing agents
such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide are commonly available and have a variety of mainstream uses: as antiseptic, disinfectant, and cleansing agents, as laboratory chemical reagents, and in the food packaging industry. In addition to their use in unconventional cancer treatments, oxidizing
agents are also proposed as components of unconventional treatments for AIDS, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and a variety of other conditions (96,297).
The late Otto Warburg, a German chemist twice awarded the Nobel Prize, was one of the first to discuss an association between oxygen levels in the body and the etiology of cancer, and to suggest that the growth of cancer cells is favored by an intracellular environment low in oxygen
(936). Many others have since expanded on Warburg's ideas, and much has been written about oxygen treatments in general. Not only is there no accepted rationale for the proposed effects of oxidizing agents in cancer treatment among current proponents, but disputes among oxygen proponents
are found in descriptions of these treatments in the unconventional literature (80,217). The role of oxygen compounds in the initiation and progression of cancer has long been a subject of mainstream scientific study. In general, active oxygen is thought to contribute in a variety of ways
to the development of malignant cells (180).
Ozone can be administered by direct infusion of the gaseous mixture into the rectum or into muscle, but it is usually given by unconventional practitioners in blood infusion, a process whereby blood is removed, treated with oxygen, and returned to the body, as explained in a recent
review by an unconventional medicine advocate:
The ozone is produced by forcing oxygen through a metal tube carrying a 300-volt charge. A pint of blood is drawn from the patient and placed in an infusion bottle. The ozone is then forced into the bottle and mixed in by shaking gently, whereupon the blood turns bright cardinal red. As
the ozone molecules dissolve into the blood they give up their third oxygen atom, releasing considerable energy which destroys all lipid-envelope virus, and apparently most other disease organisms as well, while leaving blood cells unharmed (297).
Medizone International, a company that manufactures a device used to deliver ozone by infusion in the blood system, has filed an investigational new drug application with FDA to study the possible use of ozone as an antiviral agent. Before phase I studies in humans can proceed under the
IND, however, the company is required to submit data, probably involving tests in animals using a range of doses, showing that ozone can be administered safely. Little information in the published, peer-reviewed literature is available on the use of ozone in general in the treatment of
cancer, or on the recommended doses and regimen for treatment. Claims for the efficacy of ozone are based on a number of papers and case reports of its use on cancer patients (926,929), in animal studies (52,586), and in cell culture (940). One paper by Sweet and colleagues, published in
Science, presents indirect evidence that atmospheric ozone selectively inhibits the growth of human tumor cells in cell culture (in vitro) (846).
Hydrogen peroxide is given in dilute form by various routes -- oral, rectal, intravenous, vaginal, and in bathing. Proponents state that hydrogen peroxide oxidizes toxins, kills bacteria and viruses, and stimulates immunity (364). One unconventional practitioner, Kurt Donsbach, who
treats cancer patients in Tijuana, formulated a line of products using hydrogen peroxide, including ear drops, nasal spray, and tooth gel. Donsbach states that every cancer patient at his clinic in Tijuana receives dilute ""infusions of the 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide throughout
their entire stay"" (262). In 1988, the U.S. Postal Service issued Donsbach a cease and desist order to stop him from claiming that the hydrogen peroxide used orally or intravenously is effective against cancer or arthritis, or that it is fit for human consumption (69). Another clinic,
the Gerson clinic in Tijuana, has recently added ozone therapy to their regimen, partly on the basis of the laboratory study by Sweet and colleagues referred to above (401). Patients at the Gerson clinic are commonly given ozone enemas, consisting of 500 to 1000 cc of ozone given rectally
in less than one minute (318).
Another form of oxygen treatment, superoxide dismutase, is an antioxidant enzyme believed to play a role in aerobic metabolism (689). Several unconventional treatment facilities in Tijuana, e.g., the Manner Clinic and American Biologics Hospital and Medical Center, reported using this
enzyme in their regimens for cancer patients (22,574).
Oxidizing agents, such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide, can destroy cells, including those of the blood-forming organs, and at some doses, can be seriously damaging or even lethal (860). The doses at which these agents can be administered safely have not yet been determined. Although
advocates of ozone and hydrogen peroxide maintain that these substances can be used safely, other unconventional practitioners have noted possible adverse effects (98).
Emanuel Revici and ""Biologically Guided Chemotherapy""
Emanuel Revici, M.D., is a physician in his nineties who currently practices in New York City. During a career spanning seven decades and four countries, Revici has developed an apparently unique approach to the treatment of cancer and a wide range of other disorders, including AIDS,
Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, chronic pain, radiation injury, schizophrenia, drug addiction, and others (597,747,748). Revici proposes that the clinical manifestations of cancer are associated with an imbalance of two general classes of lipids (fatty acids and sterols) in the body and in
some cases also with the presence of particular lipid constituents (conjugated fatty acids). Using a test system he developed to measure certain physiologic changes that he believes reflect these lipid imbalances, Revici treats patients he identifies as having a predominance of one or the
other class of lipid with one or more lipid-based pharmacologic agents intended to counteract the imbalance (741). Revici characterizes his regimen as a ""dualistic"" approach to cancer chemotherapy (747), referring to his proposal that different and opposing groups of agents,
rather than a single type operating by one mode of action, may be required to treat cancer.
Revici received his medical degree in 1920 from the University of Bucharest, Romania, where he later worked as assistant professor in internal medicine. He practiced medicine and conducted clinical research in Paris (1936-41) and in Mexico City (1941-46) before settling in New York,
where in 1946 he established the Institute of Applied Biology. Since 1947, Revici has maintained a private practice in New York. He also served as chief of oncology (1955-65) and as consultant (1965-78) at Trafalgar Hospital, formerly the Beth David Hospital, a New York facility purchased
by Revici's fundraising organization (212,213). A recent review of Revici's career characterized that hospital as a general care facility employing over 200 resident and visiting physicians, and noted that it contained animal research laboratories staffed by 35 scientists and technicians,
""all involved in projects inspired by or related to Revici's theories and therapeutic method"" (212). Trafalgar Hospital closed in 1978, reportedly because of financial difficulties (211).
In 1949, the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (J.A.M.A.) warning against Revici's treatment, among other unconventional treatments (39). In a letter to the editor, the AMA article was criticized for disparaging
Revici with unwarranted accusations about his work (738). The J.A.M.A. article was reportedly reprinted and distributed by the ACS's Brooklyn Cancer Committee, which Revici later sued for libel. The case was eventually settled out of court through mediation by the Medical Society of the
State of New York (740). The ACS Committee on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management published its first statement on Revici's treatment in 1961 (22a). Since 1984, Revici has faced legal challenge regarding his license to practice medicine in New York State; he is currently on probation for
a 5-year period that began in October 1988. Two malpractice suits charging medical negligence have also been filed against him in Federal court since 1983 (see ch. 11 for details).
The main source of information available about Revici's treatment is his book, published in 1961, entitled Research in Physiopathology as a Basis of Guided Chemotherapy with Special Application to Cancer (747), which focuses on the theoretical basis for his approach. In it, he argues
that ""cancer -- as well as other conditions -- can be integrated into a hierarchic concept of organization which applies throughout nature."" According to his theory, that organization is determined by certain laws, among them the law of dualism, or opposing forces, at every
level. He discusses his views of the activity of organic and inorganic substances in relation to: the level of organization in the body at which they act (nuclear, cellular, organ, etc.); their ""dualistic nature""; other substances in the body (particularly lipids); and how they
affect the body's defense mechanism (747). Revici believes that this dualism affects one's physiologic state and is key to understanding how disease may develop and how it may be treated.
Revici describes his treatment for cancer -- which he refers to as ""biologically guided chemotherapy"" -- as nontoxic, individually guided chemotherapy using lipid and lipid-based substances (210). He believes that tumor cells, as well as other types of abnormal cells, share a
common biochemical characteristic -- an imbalance in the normal distribution of lipids -- which he views not as the primary cause of cancer, but as the direct cause of its impact on the body's metabolism. He categorizes two general patterns of local and systemic effects of lipid imbalances
reportedly found by him in patients with cancer, one pattern resulting from an excess of fatty acids and the other pattern resulting from an excess of sterols.
According to Revici's analysis, a relative predominance of fatty acids leads to an electrolyte imbalance, specifically an increase in sodium in the extracellular fluids, and an alkaline environment in tumor tissues; Revici refers to this as a ""catabolic"" condition. In the
opposite case, a predominance of sterols reportedly leads to a reduction in cell membrane permeability and an inhibition of the cells' oxidative processes, which in turn reduces the availability of intracellular oxygen, interferes with the breakdown of carbohydrates, and results in excess
lactic acid in the extracellular fluids; Revici refers to this outcome as an ""anabolic"" condition. [Anabolic and catabolic are terms referring to the body's metabolism. In usual usage, anabolic metabolism corresponds to the constructive synthesis of macromolecules, whereas
catabolic refers to the breakdown of complex materials in the body and the release of energy.] Patients determined by Revici to have a predominance of fatty acids are treated with sterols and other agents with positive electrical charges that can to with the negatively charged fatty acids.
Those determined to have a predominance of sterols are treated with fatty acids and other agents that increase the metabolic activity of fatty acids (513,741,749).
A physician who worked closely with Revici from 1946 until 1957 noted in a summary of Revici's approach that ""since the lipid imbalances appear to play an important role in determining the metabolic, local and systemic features of the disease,"" the treatment regimen is
intended to modify those features by administering substances that influence the lipid imbalance. Some of Revici's research efforts focused on developing chemical agents capable of modifying lipid imbalances and on developing tests to identify and measure the balance of lipid in individual
patients (741).
Revici has some support for various aspects of his theoretical approach among a small group of researchers. In a recently published paper, Harold Ladas reviewed Revici's work with selenium compounds in the treatment of cancer (513). In a recent unpublished manuscript, Leonard Kunst,
Harold Ladas, and Frederick van Kampen reviewed some aspects of Revici's theory in the context of current knowledge about the role of lipids in the cancer process, and suggested that lipid substances such as those Revici uses may act by targeting and potentiating the action of antitumor
agents at the tumor site (494). In another unpublished manuscript, Kunst and Ladas reviewed Revici's proposal regarding biochemical changes in lipids associated with radiation exposure and the use of n-butanol to treat radiation injury (492). A third unpublished paper by Kunst and Ladas
examined Revici's ideas concerning correlations between the molecular charge and biological activity of certain types of molecules (493). In a 1985 Institute of Applied Biology publication, one of Revici's medical associates, Dwight McKee, described many aspects of Revici's current
theoretical approach to treating a wide variety of conditions (597). Thus far, however, there has been no comprehensive review in the mainstream medical literature of Revici's theory and its application to cancer treatment.
Revici's treatment regimen has apparently not been adopted or continued by other practitioners outside of his institute, either in the context of conventional clinical studies or unconventional practice, so at present, Revici's New York office is the only site where the treatment is
used. For several years in the 1960s, however, some of Revici's treatment agents were reportedly used in Belgium by the late Joseph Maisin, who at that time was Director of the Cancer Institute of the University of Louvain and President of the International Union Against Cancer. According
to several letters written to Revici between 1965 and 1970 (573), Maisin obtained a number of compounds from Revici (including fluoroheptanol, selenium diethylthiocarbamate, and others referred to as ""PCA,"" ""CMS,"" ""MHS,"" ""MHSe5,"" and ""anti-MHSe"")
and treated patients generally described as those with advanced metastatic cancer who had failed previous treatment. Some patients were treated with a combination of Revici's agents and radiotherapy, while others were given Revici's agents alone. These letters do not describe the
conditions under which the patients were treated, e.g., as part of a formal evaluation or on an informal basis, or how particular agents were chosen for particular patients. The letters were apparently written to inform Revici of Maisin's clinical observations, and included brief summaries
of some cases considered to have responded well to the treatment. Maisin noted that some patients experienced tumor regressions, disappearance of metastases, and improved functional status following treatment. Maisin died in 1970 and no further information about Maisin's experience with
Revici's treatment is available.
Earlier in his career, Revici published papers in South American and European scientific journals (31). Since the 1950s (751,961), however, Revici has not published updated descriptions or studies of his cancer treatment in the peer- reviewed scientific literature (although attempts
were reportedly made to do so (739,836)). The most recent openly available description of his cancer treatment regimen written by Revici is his 1961 book, referred to above, which provides some information from laboratory experiments and clinical experience (including case histories of
patients treated with his method) supporting his theoretical approach. The book does not, however, provide details of the empirical basis for classifying cancer patients' metabolic conditions or for choosing specific treatment agents according to that system of classification. At present,
Revici and his associates appear to be the only ones who know how to interpret and apply his diagnostic and treatment protocols, since the protocols are, at least to some extent, proprietary and cannot be deduced from his book. In the absence of up-to-date descriptions of the rationale and
process of his treatment regimen, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for Revici's treatment to be continued in the future without his personal involvement.
Revici's Cancer Treatment Regimen
In order to determine whether a patient's condition is anabolic or catabolic, Revici tests for certain characteristics (specific gravity, pH, and surface tension) of the patient's urine before treatment is initiated. Revici believes that these indices, while not diagnostic of cancer,
reflect systemic changes in the body produced by lipid imbalances (513,741). As treatment progresses, the urine is reexamined periodically to determine whether and by how much these indices change. A sterol predominant or anabolic condition is considered to be indicated by urine that is
alkaline (pH greater than 6.0 to 6.2), has a high surface tension (above 68 dynes/cm2), and has a low specific gravity. Patients whose urine measures below 6.0 to 6.2 in pH and below 68 dynes/cm2 in surface tension are considered to be catabolic, or fatty acid predominant (741).
Revici reportedly believes that, in healthy individuals, these urine indices tend to fluctuate up and down over a narrow range around median values -- pH of 6.0 to 6.2 and surface tension of 68 dynes/cm2 -- while cancer patients tend to show values fixed at either higher or lower levels
(741). Progress of treatment is measured by the degree to which it alters these urine indices toward normal values. Revici asks his patients to monitor these changes at home using a colorimeter to indicate urine pH. Urinary surface tension is measured using a glass ""urotensiometer""
(747), a device designed for Revici's use. Other urine indices reportedly used in Revici's classification method include specific gravity and a chloride index (the ratio between specific gravity and chloride concentration) (748).
The urine indices that Revici uses as diagnostic and treatment tools are not used in this way in mainstream medicine; they are not diagnostic of the presence of cancer or its systemic effects and have wide natural variations depending, for example, on fluid intake and ingestion of acid
or alkaline foods or other substances. Revici's 1961 book and some of his articles discuss the use of these urine indices, but do not offer evidence validating their reliable use in identifying metabolic abnormalities, or confirming that such metabolic abnormalities actually exist among
patients. In support of his conclusions about these tests and their clinical significance, Revici refers to laboratory experiments and clinical studies conducted under his direction at the Institute of Applied Biology over many years, the bulk of which have apparently not been reported,
critiqued, or confirmed externally.
Revici uses the Periodic Table of Elements as one of several guides to deciding on treatment regimens for his patients. Based on his study of the organization of elements in the Periodic Table, he believes that the periods (horizontal rows) indicate at which level of biological
organization in the body a particular element acts -- at the level of subnuclear particles, the nucleus, the cell, the tissue, or the whole body. He also believes that the placement of elements in particular series (columns) determines whether they act anabolically or catabolically in the
body (749). For example, he considers elements in group VIA -- oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium -- active against a chronically anabolic state (513).
According to Revici and several others writing about Revici's treatment, a wide variety of chemical agents has been used in his regimen. Revici recently stated that most of the substances he uses as treatments for cancer are either ""twin formations"" (reportedly defined as two
adjacent carbon atoms having the same induced electrical charge (493)) or inorganic elements (e.g., iron, magnesium, copper, or selenium) incorporated in or bound to lipids (749), but he did not say which specific substances are in current use in his practice.
Since the 1940s, one of the agents Revici has frequently used to treat patients classified as having a sterol predominance is lipid-bound selenium. Revici reportedly has used many different preparations of selenium, such as ""T Sel"" (selenium bound to ""eleostearic
acid,"" ""Rel"" (""a mixture of a 7-carbon diselenide and 3-heptanone"") (513), and hexyldiselenide (741). Other substances used to treat this classification of patients include: fatty acids (including some isolated from human and animal sources), sulfur compounds
(e.g., colloidal sulfur, sodium thiosulfate), hydrines (e.g., epichlorohydrin), aldehydes, male hormones (testosterone), and mustard compounds (513).
Substances Revici has reported using to treat patients classified as catabolic or fatty acid predominant include: sterols (e.g. cholesterol), alcohols (e.g., butanol, glycerol, heptanol, octanol), female hormones (estrogens), amines (e.g. aminobutanol), nicotinic acid derivatives,
metals (mercury, iron, bismuth), and halogens (e.g., iodine) (747).
The treatment agents are given orally or by injection (210). Revici's technicians prepare the treatment agents according to Revici's formulas and instructions (213). To OTA's knowledge, these treatment agents have not been analyzed independently. According to a 1989 statement on Revici
by the American Cancer Society, Revici was issued 17 U.S. patents between 1981 and 1988 for chemical formulations described for use against cancer, viral diseases, and substance abuse, and for termination of pregnancy (31).
While selenium compounds can generally be toxic (197), Revici reportedly believes that he has identified a form of selenium that is nontoxic to patients (the ""negative bivalent form"") (213). He believes that treatment can cause inflammation around the area of the tumor,
causing it to become more painful and to become larger and softer, before causing it to shrink and disappear (513). No adverse effects from Revici's treatment have been reported in the medical literature.
Claims
Revici states in his book that his treatment ""when correctly applied...can, in many cases, bring under control even far- advanced malignancies"" (747). In support of this, he presents many case histories of cancer patients with partial or complete remissions following his
treatment. The recent transcripts of a congressional hearing held in New York also contain numerous presentations by and on behalf of Revici's cancer patients claiming remissions as a result of his treatment (749). Revici concludes his 1961 book by noting:
The results obtained and especially their high proportion, even in far advanced cases, permits a fair judgment of the place of the present form of application of this method in the fight against cancer. Based on these results, we are fully entitled to consider it, not only a highly
beneficial treatment which can be offered now for this disease, but even a major step nearer to the solution of the problem of the therapy of cancer (747).
Attempts at Evaluating the Revici Treatment Regimen
In 1978, two compounds containing selenium that Revici has used -- amyl selenide and selenium diethyldithiocarbamate (""Secar"") -- were submitted on Revici's behalf to the Drug Therapeutics Program, NCI, for testing of antitumor activity in an animal tumor screening test (1).
One of the compounds, amyl selenide, showed antitumor activity in the mouse P388 Leukemia test system (905). The other compound, selenium diethyldithiocarbamate, showed no antitumor activity in this test (905). Although agents that test positive in prescreen are usually tested further in
NCI's tumor panel, amyl selenide was not submitted for further testing. Another compound, trithioformaldehyde, was said by Revici supporters to have been tested in experimental animals at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in the late 1970s (212,652), but the Institute has no records to
confirm such tests or their results (754).
More recently, another selenium compound that Revici reportedly uses was tested in several other animal tumor systems. According to a letter from a British company (Advisory Services, Ltd., London), the diheptyl diselenide was reportedly tested at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and
Westminster Hospital, London, on a variety of tumor systems, and was found to be active in four of them (L1210 leukemia, Lewis lung metastases, M5076 liver metastases, and early S180 tumor growth). Acute and chronic toxicity of the compound was also studied, and it was found that the dose
at which antitumor activity was found was ""fairly close to the toxic dose"" (484). Further studies on the compound were recommended ""to determine more precisely the nature of the activity and to see if we can obtain significant anti-tumor activity without, at the same time,
inducing undue toxic reactions"" (484).
As a means of presenting Revici's overall clinical experience in cancer treatment, a descriptive study of clinical outcomes in all the cancer patients treated with the Revici regimen between 1946 and 1955 was summarized in an unpublished paper (741). The paper was written by Robert
Ravich, M.D., who worked closely with Revici at the Institute of Applied Biology and who, with Revici, treated the patients described in the report. Most of the patients were reported as ""far advanced' or ""terminal"" and had had previous treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation,
hormones, and nitrogen mustard). Cases included in the report were limited to those whose diagnosis of cancer was ""clearly established by the best available means, by qualified physicians, surgeons and pathologists not connected with the Institute of Applied Biology"" but
otherwise were not selectively included or excluded, since the report was intended to describe the entire population of patients treated by Revici during that time.
The 1,047 patients were classified as either fatty acid or sterol predominant, according to Revici's diagnostic testing (based mainly on urine analyses of pH and surface tension, as described above). Of the patients found to have a sterol predominance, 152 were treated with sodium
thiosulfate and sulfurized oil; 95 with sulfhydryl containing compounds (such as ethyl, hexyl, heptyl and dodecyl mercaptan, methylthioglycholate, and dimercaprol); 78 with fatty acid mixtures extracted from various natural sources including human placenta, and animal and fish organs; 64
with conjugated or alpha-hydroxy fatty acids; and 53 with hexyldiselenide. Of the patients found to have a fatty acid predominance, 106 were treated with n-butanol; 77 with glycerin, 51 with cholesterol or other non-saponifiable lipids extracted from unspecified organs; and 10 with octanol.
Treatment agents given to the remaining 361 patients were not specified. Individual determinations of dose were made on the basis of each patient's urine analyses and it was noted that no toxic reactions were observed. Treatments were given orally and by injection.
Both objective and subjective outcomes were recorded. A favorable objective response was defined as measurable ""reductions in size and extent of the disease as visualized either directly by the eye or by X-ray, or by palpation"" that were ""sustained for a significant
period of time and in the direction of improvement over several successive observation intervals."" However, in some cases, stabilization of disease ""over long intervals"" was also considered an objective response. A favorable subjective response was defined as
""satisfactory improvement for a sustained period as reported by the patient,"" usually referring to relief from pain, a sense of wellbeing, and increased energy, strength, and appetite.
Of the 1,047 cases reviewed, 100 were judged to have had favorable objective and subjective responses; 11 had objective responses only; and 95 had subjective responses only. These cases included 23 different types of primary cancers. Two hundred ninety-six patients were judged to have
had no response, subjective or objective, and 545 patients had equivocal or undetermined responses (380 of this latter group were treated less than three months). Details of the individual cases were not given in the report.
To date, the only published clinical study of Revici's treatment for cancer is a paper that appeared in J.A.M.A. in 1965 written by the ""Clinical Appraisal Group"" (CAG), a group of nine New York physicians assembled specifically for that study (571). According to the report,
the study was done at the request of the Board of Trustees of Revici's Trafalgar Hospital. It evaluated the clinical course and outcomes of selected cancer patients who were referred to Revici for treatment. The authors reported that they did not influence or modify the treatment Revici
offered to these patients during the study. All of these patients were considered refractory to conventional treatment. Other criteria were that only hormone-independent (571), solid tumors, certified by tissue diagnosis, were included. Excluded from the study were tumor types that were
not expected to progress in a short period of time and patients who had recently undergone conventional therapy. Thirty- three cancer patients were ultimately included in the study.
The authors reported that 22 of the 33 patients died of cancer or its complications while on the Revici treatment. Eight other patients left the study group ""in unimproved condition"" after some time on the regimen. Four of these eight patients later died of cancer, two of them
went elsewhere for palliative treatment, and two were lost to followup. The three remaining patients were under Revici's care at the close of the study period and all of these were reported to have shown signs of tumor progression. The study group concluded that none of these 33 patients
Revici treated showed signs of objective tumor regression. The group concluded that ""the Revici method of treatment of cancer is without value"" (571).
Apparently responding to a full version of the report (a two page summary of which became the published J.A.M.A. version), Revici wrote a detailed statement sharply criticizing the CAG's methods, conduct, and interpretations (750). He also presented summaries of patient records that he
claimed showed objective responses to treatment, contradicting the CAG's interpretation of the same data. He noted, among other things, that several patients in the study had tumor remissions that the study group allegedly failed to recognize. Revici also noted that it was he, rather than
the Board of Directors of the Trafalgar Hospital, who requested the study in the ""hope that the demonstration of positive results in even a few of these advanced cases would excite sufficient interest to lead to a large scale study of our approach."" He particularly criticized the
overall conclusion stated in the full version of the report (that ""the Revici method of treatment of cancer...should be abandoned.""), he wrote:
In the event that this method should have proven ineffective in the types of cancer accepted (in the analysis), and not a single reduction in the size of any tumor noted, these should have been the only conclusions that could have been rightfully drawn. To conclude from a limited study,
such as this, that the method should be discontinued, in all cancers, is to say that since surgery and radiation have failed in these same terminal patients, these ""recognized"" methods should also be discontinued, not only in these types of cancer but in all cancers in general.
(emphasis in original)
Recently, Seymour Brenner, M.D., a radiologist in private practice in New York, took initial steps toward documenting and verifying the medical records of ten patients treated by Revici. In presenting summaries of these cases at the March 1990 meeting of the Advisory Panel for the
present OTA study, Brenner stated that he believed these ten patients to be examples of successful treatment with Revici's method, citing evidence of tumor regression, improved quality of life, and enhanced survival. These case histories have not yet been subjected to critical review. No
prospective controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Revici's treatment has been conducted.
Vitamin C
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate) may be discussed more frequently in connection with the common cold, but its use in the treatment and palliation of cancer has also been promoted and widely adopted; thousands of U.S. cancer patients are believed to take large doses of vitamin C
(756). The proponents most closely associated with the study and use of vitamin C for cancer treatment are the Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, PhD, whose advocacy, expressed in books, articles, and personal appearances publicized by the media, has been primarily responsible for popularizing
vitamin C for cancer, and his colleague Ewan Cameron, M.B., Ch.B., a Scottish surgeon. Treatment with vitamin C is generally promoted as an adjunct to conventional cancer treatment, with the aim, according to Cameron and Pauling, of supporting the patient's natural defenses against the
disease -- e.g., to support encapsulation of the tumor, to resist the formation of metastases, to enhance immunologic competence, to reduce cachexia, and to improve general health status (158).
Although it is an essential nutrient, vitamin C cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from the diet or from supplements, which can be prepared synthetically or extracted from fruits and vegetables. Relatively small amounts of vitamin C in the diet are needed to
avoid overt deficiency diseases such as scurvy. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin C is 45 milligrams (0.045 grams) per day (661a). Its use in unconventional cancer treatment usually involves megadoses (usually 10 grams per day or more) of vitamin C, administered
intravenously or orally (dissolved in water or juice or as capsules). Dosages are adjusted to each patient, but in general, they usually begin with one to two grams daily and increase gradually to ten grams or more per day. The tolerance level is reached when the patient experiences the
vitamin's laxative effects (when taken orally), and dosage is then reduced and maintained at a slightly lower level (557). Proponents state that they do not know the best dose in cancer patients, but generally assume it to be about 10 grams per day, which is ""as much ascorbate as the
patient can tolerate without gastrointestinal side effects"" (158).
The idea of using vitamin C in cancer treatment was first proposed in the early 1970s by Cameron. Cameron examined the process of uncontrolled invasiveness in tumor growth, and looked for ways to inhibit cancer cells from infiltrating and damaging surrounding normal tissue and from
metastasizing to distant organs. He focused on the possible role of an enzyme, hyaluronidase, in supporting tumor invasiveness, and suggested that manipulation of an inhibitor of this enzyme, which existed in the blood, could be used to control the process (151). In the early 1970s,
Cameron and his colleague Douglas Rotman noted that the inhibitor molecule they were examining contained an ascorbate component. They hypothesized that increasing the supply of ascorbate in the blood might increase the production or action of the hyaluronidase inhibitor, and thereby
restrain the invasion of tumor cells into normal tissue (160).
Linus Pauling, working in California, considered a possible role for vitamin C in cancer treatment. He focused on the role of collagen in the process of tumor invasiveness, and noted that vitamin C was required for the synthesis of collagen (158). Cameron and Pauling, collaborating in
their research, suggested that increasing the intake of vitamin C would stimulate the synthesis of more collagen fibrils and thereby strengthen it, which in turn would help restrain malignant cells from invading surrounding tissue and increase the body's natural resistance to cancer (155).
They later reported that a deficiency of vitamin C was associated with a weaker intercellular matrix, and suggested that malignant cells could more easily infiltrate local tissue and metastasize to distant sites as a result (159).
Cameron began administering high dose vitamin C intravenously to some of his most advanced cancer patients at the Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch Lomonside, Scotland, in 1971. He reported that ""the majority had gained a respite period of relative well-being, comfort, and dignity""
despite eventually succumbing to their disease (153). In 1974, Cameron and a colleague reported tumor regressions and subjective benefits in cancer patients treated with high- dose vitamin C (154). He and Pauling reported enhanced survival and improved well-being (improved appetite,
increased mental alertness, decreased need for pain relievers, etc.) among patients who took high-dose vitamin C (156,157) (see discussion below for details of these studies).
Cameron and Pauling's advocacy of the use of vitamin C in cancer patients sets them apart from mainstream medicine, but they are by no means alone in research into the biochemical and physiologic effects of ascorbate in experimental systems. During the 1980s in particular, a wide range
of experimental studies supporting a biological rationale for considering the role of ascorbate in cancer processes was conducted and reported in the literature. Many of the studies focus on the role of vitamin C in preventing the development of cancer, e.g., epidemiologic studies
examining associations between consumption of foods containing vitamin C with cancer incidence, reviewed and summarized in the recent National Research Council (NRC) document Diet and Health (661). That document also reviewed experimental evidence concerning the role of ascorbic acid in
preventing the formation of certain carcinogens in the body and in enhancing cellular immunity. In addition, studies have examined the effect of ascorbate in animal tumor models, which have produced positive, though somewhat variable, results (342).
Claims
Cameron and Pauling state that high doses of vitamin C are ""helpful to virtually every cancer patient and can be dramatically beneficial to a fortunate few"" (558). They claim that vitamin C ""not only increases the time of survival of the patient but also leads to
improvement in general health and the feeling of well-being"" (158). They note in their 1979 book that:
""Giving vitamin C in large dosage to patients with advanced cancer produces subjective benefit in almost every patient by about the fifth day. The patient will claim to feel better, stronger, and mentally more alert. Distressing symptoms such as bone pain from skeletal metastases
diminish and may even disappear completely... the patient becomes more lively and shows more interest and also eats more food, indicating that he has a better appetite and is no longer feeling nauseated and miserable"" (158).
Vitamin C is generally advocated as a supportive measure, not a replacement for mainstream treatment. ""With the possible exception of during intense chemotherapy,"" Cameron and Pauling write, ""we strongly advocate the use of supplemental ascorbate in the management of all
cancer patients from as early in the illness as possible..."" (158) to make patients more resistant to their illness and to reduce toxic side effects of mainstream treatment.
Cameron and Pauling's 1979 book, Cancer and Vitamin C (158), contains brief case histories of patients who had reportedly exhausted all mainstream treatment options. Responses to vitamin C treatment are categorized as: no response (20% of patients), minimal response (25%), retardation
of tumor growth (25%), cytostasis (the ""standstill effect"") (20%), tumor regression (9%), and tumor hemorrhage and necrosis (1%). The authors speculate that better results would be seen with earlier adjunctive use of vitamin C with surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal treatment,
although possibly not with chemotherapy (even though vitamin C is stated to protect against unpleasant side effects of the chemotherapy).
Pauling states that ""a large body of scientific work clearly shows that vitamin C plays a central and most important role in developing and maintaining the immune system"" and that it is ""a key material necessary to this defense system"" (556). He believes it acts by
""strengthening the natural protective mechanisms of the body and making them more effective"" (158).
Potential Adverse Effects
Pauling states that large doses of vitamin C can be given over long periods of time without serious side effects. No large case series or placebo controlled studies have revealed any adverse effects of megadoses of vitamin C other than looseness of the bowels. In the two studies
conducted by the Mayo Clinic (discussed later in this chapter), vitamin C megadoses were found to be relatively nontoxic (236,622). Mild nausea and vomiting, the most frequent toxic reactions, which affected 40% of patients in the earlier study (236), were seen in identical proportions of
treatment and placebo groups.
The medical literature contains a few case reports of toxicities that might have been associated with taking large doses of vitamin C. One report suggested a risk of kidney failure in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency (587,696). Vitamin C ingestion may also increase the
risk of kidney stones (812), although no cases have been reported. It has also been argued that vitamin C may increase the risk of other types of kidney stone, e.g., urate stones, and Stein and colleagues (833) noted that a single 4 gram dose of vitamin C could increase urinary excretion
of uric acid, which might increase the risk of developing urate stones. No cases of urate stones have been reported in the literature, however.
Several additional side effects noted in a small number of patients have been attributed to high doses of vitamin C, although the clinical significance of these problems is unclear. These side effects include ""rebound scurvy"" (a scurvy-like syndrome) resulting from sudden
cessation of high-dose vitamin C intake (818), gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach due to acidity of vitamin C) (821), hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) (161), reduction of serum ceruloplasmin activity (which suggests interference with copper metabolism) (290), and
iron overload.
Attempts at Evaluating High-Dose Vitamin C in Cancer Treatment
The first major study reporting clinical results of vitamin C treatment in patients with advanced cancer was published in 1974 by Cameron and Campbell (154). They studied a series of 50 consecutive patients with advanced cancer who were under Cameron's care at the Vale of Leven Hospital
in Scotland and who, at the time, had no viable mainstream treatment options. Most patients were treated with 10 g/day of oral ascorbic acid (a liquid formulation), and some began with intravenous ascorbic acid for up to ten days, at a usual dose of 10 g/day (some received higher doses),
then switching to the liquid oral formulation.
The authors categorized the responses of patients' tumors into the following categories: no response, 17 patients; minimal response, 10 patients; growth retardation, 11 patients; cytostasis (stopping of growth), 3 patients; tumor regression, 5 patients; and tumor hemorrhage and
necrosis, 4 patients. In addition, the majority of patients reported improvements in wellbeing. Other benefits included: relief of pain from bone metastases; in one patient, relief of headache from a cranial tumor; reduction in malignant ascites and pleural effusions; reduction in
hematuria (blood in the urine) in patients with urinary tract cancers; reduced malignant hepatomegaly (liver enlargement) and reduced malignant jaundice in some patients; and halting or reversal of rising erythrocyte sedimentation rates. The authors also claimed that these patients lived
longer than expected, an outcome that cannot be reliably measured in this type of study, which lacked a comparable control group.
In a 1976 study (156), Cameron collaborated with Linus Pauling, reporting on the 50 patients from the Cameron and Campbell study described above plus 50 additional ascorbate- treated patients. The patients were matched for certain characteristics (age, sex, and site and histologic
features of the primary tumor) in a one to 10 ratio with patients not treated with vitamin C whose records were pulled from the files of the Vale of Leven Hospital. All patients in both groups had been labeled as ""untreatable"" with mainstream treatment. A followup to this study
was published in 1978 (157) in which 10 of the original 100 ascorbate-treated patients who had rare cancers were replaced with 10 patients with more common cancers, for whom 10 good control ""matches"" could be made. A new control group was chosen from the same pool of hospital
cases as for the earlier study (about half of the earlier control group was also in this group). In the 1976 and 1978 papers, comparisons of survival from: 1) first ""hospital attendance,"" and 2) ""date of untreatability"" were presented. In the later results, which were
somewhat more extreme than the earlier ones, a survival time from date of untreatability for vitamin C patients of 293 days was reported, compared with 38 days for the control patients. The survival times from first hospital attendance were 681 days for treated and 360 for control
patients. Cameron knew that these studies were ""less than perfect"" methodologically, but he hoped that they would stimulate interest among investigators with experience in clinical trial design to carry out randomized trials (153).
The experience of 99 Japanese cancer patients, classified as ""terminal,"" who received vitamin C during the period 1973 through 1977 has been reported by Morishige and Murata (640), researchers affiliated with the Linus Pauling Institute. The most prevalent cancers were of the
stomach, lung, and uterus, accounting for more than half the total. Patients were divided into two groups for analysis: ""low- ascorbate,"" defined as zero to four g of vitamin C per day (44 patients), and ""high-ascorbate,"" defined as four or more g/day (14 patients had
5-9 g/day, 13 had 10-29 g/day, and 28 had 30-60 g/day). The practice in the hospital where they were treated had evolved over the time period of this retrospective review toward larger doses, so the low- ascorbate group was treated generally in the earlier years and the high-ascorbate
group in later years.
Patients in the low- and high-ascorbate groups were compared according to ""survival times after being pronounced terminal."" The low-ascorbate group survived an average of 43 days and the high-ascorbate group, 201+ days (some patients were still alive at the time the paper was
written). The authors concluded that this report ""may be considered to substantiate the observations reported by Cameron and Pauling."" They further concluded that ""vitamin C seems to improve the state of well being, as indicated by better appetite, increased mental
alertness, and desire to return to ordinary life."" No information is given on how these characteristics were assessed.
This study has similar drawbacks to Cameron and Pauling's, mainly that the groups compared were not comparable on factors other than vitamin C. In this study, the two groups were treated at different (though overlapping) time periods, making the comparison more tenuous. The suggestive
results of this study, however, reinforced the need for randomized studies.
The First Mayo Clinic Study
Cameron and Pauling's clinical studies, which generated widespread interest among cancer patients, prompted a series of three NCI-funded randomized trials of vitamin C. The first trial, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, enrolled 150 advanced cancer patients; most (93%) had progressive
disease after prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy and the rest were considered too ill to undergo mainstream treatment (236). About 40% of the patients had colorectal cancer, which was also a prevalent type in Cameron's studies. About 20% had pancreatic cancer, 10% had lung cancer, and the
rest had various other types of cancer.
Of the 150 patients randomized to receive vitamin C or placebo, 27 chose not to participate immediately following randomization, before they had taken any of their assigned medication. The 63 patients in the control group were given a ""comparably flavored lactose placebo."" The
vitamin C dose was 10 g/day, as recommended by Cameron and Pauling, taken as 20 500-milligram capsules; those taking the placebo were also given 20 capsules per day. Treatment was continued until death or until the patient was no longer able to take the oral treatment. Median survival for
all patients in the study was about seven weeks.
The survival curves for the vitamin C-treated and placebo- treated groups were nearly identical. In the entire study population, there was one long-term survivor, a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who had a massively enlarged liver, and jaundice. He had not responded to
""many previous attempts at chemotherapy,"" but had symptomatic improvement and some reduction of the jaundice, and was alive 63 weeks after entering the study. This patient was in the placebo group.
The two groups of patients taking vitamin C or placebo were found to be similar in the percentages of patients experiencing symptomatic relief and side effects. About a quarter in each group reported improved appetite, and about 40%, improved activity levels. Improvements in strength
and pain control were slightly greater in the vitamin C group (63% of patients) compared to controls (58%), but this difference was not statistically significant. More than 40% of both vitamin C and placebo groups reported nausea and leg swelling, between 20 and 40% reported vomiting,
heartburn, and diarrhea.
Creagan and coauthors concluded that vitamin C conferred no significant survival or symptomatic benefit on the patients in the study. Noting that the patients in this study differed, however, from those in Cameron and Pauling's studies in at least one respect -- prior treatment with
immunosuppressive chemotherapy -- Creagan stated that it was impossible to draw any conclusions about the possible effectiveness of vitamin C in previously untreated patients. The immune systems of the patients in Creagan's study may have been more compromised (though not considered
entirely unable of mounting an immune response) than Cameron's patients, few of whom had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Creagan and colleagues noted that their patients' ""earlier immunosuppressive treatment might have obscured any benefit"" resulting from vitamin C.
The Second Mayo Clinic Study
The postulated interference of previous chemotherapy on the action of vitamin C prompted the Mayo Clinic investigators to undertake another randomized trial, this time including only patients with no previous chemotherapy (622). All patients had advanced colorectal cancer, a type
claimed by Cameron and Pauling to respond well to vitamin C, and one for which no chemotherapy was recommended at the time of the study. These patients were not considered eligible for surgery or radiation. The doses of vitamin C and placebo were the same as for the first Mayo Clinic trial
and were administered orally in the form of 20 tablets per day. No intravenous or oral liquid doses were used.
The endpoints in this trial were: survival after randomization, time to disease progression, objective regression, toxicity, and changes in pre-trial symptoms. One hundred and one patients were randomized, one dropping out before taking any of the capsules, so the analysis is based on
the 100 patients who participated. Eight patients stopped taking the capsules or reduced their dosage for a variety of reasons. Three of these cases were known to be related to adverse effects of treatment: one taking placebo stopped because of intolerable side effects, and the other two,
who were taking vitamin C, reduced dosages because of gastrointestinal upset. All treatment was stopped at progression of disease, worsening of symptoms or performance status, or loss of body weight. As in the first Mayo Clinic study, side effects were similar among the two groups, and not
generally severe.
The study found no difference in time to progression of disease and no increase in survival time in patients treated with vitamin C; through the first year of followup, 49% of patients taking vitamin C and 47% of patients taking placebo were alive, and there was a substantially larger
proportion of long-term survivors in the placebo group. No patients in the study had measurable tumor regression. Eleven vitamin C-treated and 17 placebo- treated patients had some cancer symptoms at the beginning of the trial; 7 and 11, respectively (about equal proportions), reported
symptomatic relief during the trial.
The Third Mayo Clinic Study
According to one of the investigators in the first two studies, a third, multi-center randomized trial, with similar treatment regimens to the first two trials, was undertaken to address criticism that the earlier trials may have been inherently biased because they were single-center
trials (234). The only published report of this trial gives preliminary results in abstract form (859). The authors report no survival benefit, but ""a possible but not significant trend of improved appetite, strength and pain control in the vitamin C group but no change in
disability."" The median survival of all patients in the study was 6.5 weeks. Little other information is given.
According to one of the investigators (235), analysis of this study was never completed because the early results were unpromising, consistent with the results of the two previous studies. He believed that the vitamin C question had been laid to rest and did not consider it important to
complete and publish full details of this study.
Australian Study
A clinical trial of the effect of megadoses of vitamin C on survival in cancer patients was begun in 1982 at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Australia (152,540). The results of the study have not yet been published, so only the design can be described here (541). Using a
double-blind, randomized prospective format, the study focused on survival time among 99 patients with Dukes D colorectal cancer who had not undergone major surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy for at least four weeks prior to entry in the trial. Asymptomatic patients were randomized to
receive either vitamin C (10 g in liquid oral doses) or placebo (liquid oral citric acid), while symptomatic patients were randomized to receive mainstream chemotherapy plus vitamin C or chemotherapy plus placebo. The vitamin C or placebo mixtures were to be continued in each patient
regardless of changes in their clinical status. The study protocol did not indicate whether patients were tested for compliance to the regimen by performing urine or blood analyses for ascorbate. According to one researcher who interviewed the principal investigator of the study, no
survival benefit of vitamin C over placebo was found in the study (757). OTA was unable to obtain further details about the results of this study.
Methodologic Issues in Evaluations of Vitamin C
The explicit aim of the first two Mayo Clinic studies was to confirm or refute Cameron and Pauling's assertion that patients treated with megadoses of vitamin C would live longer than expected and would benefit from an improved quality of life during their illness. The Mayo Clinic
studies attempted to test Cameron's treatment regimen in prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies designed to generate unbiased conclusions about effects of the treatment. As discussed above, Moertel and colleagues found that patients who were randomly assigned to vitamin C had
no survival advantage over patients assigned to placebo. A major consideration in interpreting Cameron and Pauling's positive results is the possibility that ""selection bias,"" a problem often encountered in retrospective, uncontrolled studies, was responsible for the apparent
success of the treatment.
Cameron does not deny the existence of inherent flaws in his studies, but he argues that the Mayo Clinic trials did not adequately test his premise or reproduce his procedure, and therefore do not refute his conclusions. Several important methodologic issues raised by the Mayo Clinic
studies, some of which have been debated in a number of published letters and articles (621,708,710,755,756), are summarized below.
Types of Patients Enrolled -- In Cameron's study, few patients were previously treated with chemotherapy, whereas in the first Mayo Clinic study, the majority had previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Pauling argued that vitamin C acted by strengthening patients' immune systems and
that those who were previously exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy were less capable of responding to the immune-enhancing effects of vitamin C than were patients who had not had chemotherapy. Creagan and colleagues argued that, although the patients were immunosuppressed, they were not
totally incapable of generating an immune response. They noted, however, that their results in pretreated patients did not allow them to draw conclusions about the possible effectiveness of vitamin C in previously untreated patients. The second Mayo Clinic study addressed this issue by
enrolling patients who more closely resembled Cameron's patients -- patients with advanced cancer of the large bowel who were previously unexposed to cytotoxic drugs.
Method of Administration of Ascorbate -- Cameron administered ascorbic acid either by intravenous solution or by oral liquid doses. In Moertel's studies, patients were instructed to take 20 tablets orally per day. It has been argued that higher blood levels of ascorbate could have been
achieved using intravenous administration compared with either oral form, but this was not measured in any of the studies reported here. Also, since oral doses given in liquid form are generally easier to take than are 20 pills a day, patient compliance with the oral tablet regimen could
have been lower than with an oral liquid regimen.
Testing for Compliance to the Regimen -- It is possible that some patients in the Mayo Clinic trials may have taken fewer than the assigned 20 pills a day (which could result in lower vitamin C doses in the treatment group) and that some patients may have self-medicated with commonly
available vitamin C supplements outside of the trial (which could result in higher vitamin C levels in the placebo group). One or both of these possibilities could reduce the difference observed between treatment and control groups and thereby make the detection of treatment effects more
unlikely.
Ascorbate concentrations in the body can be measured in samples of urine or blood. Such testing by urinalysis was not conducted in the first Mayo Clinic trial, but was done to a limited extent in the second trial, where eleven patients were tested at one point: five patients assigned to
the vitamin C group showed high urine ascorbate levels, and five patients assigned to the placebo group had ""negligible"" levels within the range of normal controls for the assay. The other patient assigned to the placebo group had an intermediate level, but the result was
attributed to problems with the assay in that case.
Cameron and Pauling argued that the levels of ascorbate measured in patients assigned to the placebo group were higher than would be expected for cancer patients and that the testing was incomplete and inadequate to verify compliance with the regimen, since only about 10% of the
patients were tested and then only once during the study. Moertel argued that their data, based on patient compliance records and urinalyses, indicated that patient compliance with the regimen was very high and that self- medication among the patients assigned to the placebo group did not
occur. Testing for ascorbate in blood, rather than urine, may have provided more meaningful data, particularly if such testing were done periodically during the study.
Duration of Treatment -- It is common in clinical trials of cytotoxic agents for treatment to be withdrawn when patients show signs of tumor progression. In Cameron's studies, vitamin C was administered to patients in most cases until the time of death, since it was believed that
vitamin C acts not by direct cytotoxic action, but by strengthening patients' resistance to the disease, slowing the rate of tumor progression, or increasing the patient's ability to forestall death even in the presence of the disease. In the second Mayo Clinic trial, vitamin C or placebo
was withdrawn when patients showed signs of significant tumor progression or deterioration in general or symptomatic status, since such signs were taken to indicate treatment failure. Cameron and Pauling argue that normal procedures for dealing with cytotoxic drugs in clinical trials
should not have been applied to vitamin C.
In addition, Pauling believes that patients could have been harmed by the sudden cessation of high doses of vitamin C, and that gradual reduction in dose is a safer approach to stopping treatment. Pauling states that high blood levels of vitamin C can drop to below normal levels when
intake is stopped abruptly (described as the ""rebound effect"") and that for a period of a week or two, very low ascorbate levels can cause greater susceptibility to infection, decreased resistance to the disease, or worsening of an existing condition (158,555). Experimental
evidence exists for a biochemical effect in the body of sudden cessation of high doses of vitamin C, but it has not yet been shown that these biochemical changes lead to overt changes in physical condition among cancer patients. In Moertel's study, patients treated with and then withdrawn
from vitamin C showed similar survival times compared to patients in the placebo group, but other possible adverse effects of ascorbate withdrawal were not specifically reported.
Although the Mayo Clinic trials addressed some of the relevant questions pertaining to the effects of vitamin C, they do not appear to have settled the controversy surrounding its efficacy in cancer treatment. In addition to the issues discussed above, the Mayo Clinic trials did not
fully address Cameron and Pauling's claims that vitamin C improves the quality of life of advanced cancer patients in helping to control pain and improving general wellbeing. Cameron and Pauling found easing of pain particularly in patients with bone metastases; few patients in the Mayo
Clinic trials had bone metastases. Among the issues noted above, only the issue of testing patients not previously treated with chemotherapy was addressed in subsequent evaluations. The other issues remain unresolved and lead to difficulties in interpreting the results of the two Mayo
Clinic studies.
Cameron reported that he and Pauling submitted a collection of ""best cases"" to NCI for review in December 1989. According to Cameron, NCI is sponsoring a symposium at NIH in September 1990, on experimental research concerning biological functions of ascorbate in relation to
cancer (153).

Laterile Treatments at Oasis of Hope
Oasis of Hope uses amygdalin (laterile) to attack the tumor. The cyanide released by amygdalin is one of the best killers of malignant cells as well. Amygdalin has a double punch. It lowers cancers resistance to treatment and it releases cyanide to kill cancer cells directly. If you wish to read the technical explanation of how these two functions of amygdalin occur, please click here.
Doctors at Oasis of Hope have experienced positive results with amygdalin. These results encourage us to continue offering laetrile to our patients. Laterile should be looked at as a therapy that can be combined with additional alternative cancer treatments and/or other antitumor agents. This is the appropriate future of amygdalin.
At Oasis of Hope, we do not use amygdalin as a stand-alone drug. We capitalize on its ability to make tumors more susceptible to other therapies. This is why we have a multifaceted program which includes: chemotherapy, lymphocyte treatment, Vitamin –C therapy, sodium bicarbinate, UV light irradiation, and ozone.
By sensitizing the cancer, we are able to avoid using aggressive therapies that can destroy the patient's quality of life. It is time for physicians to consider how to use amygdalin in combination with conventional therapies at lower, non-aggressive dosages. Amygdalin, combined with vitamin C, can deplete glutathione and cysteine in tumor cells and make it possible to destroy the cancer with integrative cancer therapies.
If amygdalin can be so helpful, why aren't more cancer treatment centers using it?
Let's talk about amygdalin's toxicity first.
What about the argument that laetrile is not effective?
How many studies are there on Laterile?
Did you know that cancer defends itself against attacks? How does Laetrile Kill Cancer
Cells?
Is there a way to lower the level of Cysteine?
Isn't cyanide a poison?
If amygdalin can be so helpful, why aren't more cancer treatment centers using it?
The first argument is that it can be toxic because it contains cyanide. The second argument is that it doesn't work.
Let's talk about amygdalin's toxicity first.
Oasis of Hope has used amygdalin as a cancer treatment with tens of thousands of patients since the early 1960s. You might say that we know a thing or two about. The cyanide released by amygdalin does not reach toxic levels that can harm or even discomfort patients. A famous researcher named June de Spain conducted a laetrile toxicity study that was published in The Little Cyanide Cookbook (Am. Media). She took three groups of rats. Group one was fed white bread. Group two was fed whole wheat bread. Group three was fed laetrile. After three months, 75 percent of rats that were eating white bread were dead. The white bread survivors were at death's door. The rats that were eating whole wheat bread were in good shape. The rats who were eating laetrile were all alive and in the best condition of the three groups. The conclusion of this FDA sponsored trial was that, ""white bread is 70 times more toxic than laetrile."" The truth of the matter is that Laetrile/amygdalin presents no risk of toxicity.
What about the argument that laetrile is not effective?
Researchers at Oasis of Hope have conducted several prospective clinical trials that demonstrated that amygdalin is quite effective in the combined treatment of the most common and deadly cancers including inoperable lung cancer, advanced prostate cancer, stage IV breast cancer, and colon cancer with liver metastasis. These studies have been submitted to several medical journals but they were rejected. Some editors cited that our studies did not have control groups. But it is scientifically valid to conduct a study and compare results with similar studies published in medical journals. That is what we did but we were still denied publication.
Other editors stated that our study was not designed properly and that the conclusion was not definitive. Others were quite candid. They rejected the studies because the use of amygdalin was too controversial. I think the third group was honest and I appreciated getting a straight answer from them.
How many studies are there on Laterile?
The only study ever published on the use of laetrile in cancer patients was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and conducted at the Mayo Clinic and three other prominent oncological centers in the USA. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1982.
In this article ""A clinical trial of amygdalin (laetrile) in the treatment of human cancer,"" Dr. Moertel, the head researcher, reported that of the 178 patients that were accepted in the study ""not one patient was cured or even stabilized"" by laetrile. Furthermore he said that ""several patients experienced symptoms of cyanide toxicity"" and that ""blood levels of cyanide approaching the lethal range"" were reported. ""Laetrile has had its day in court…"" says Moertel and ends authoritatively, ""The evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, is that it [laetrile] doesn't benefit patients with advanced cancer, and there is no reason to believe that it would be any more effective in the earlier stages of the disease.""
What's disappointing about the article is the editorial bias of the NEJM. Why did the NCI and the Mayo Clinic bypass all scientific protocol? This study had no control group. It was not designed properly and not one of the researchers had any experience with laetrile. The NEJM, in normal conditions, will not publish studies that are not peer reviewed by experts on the subject. There are very few laetrile experts and all have worked with Dr. Francisco Contreras.
Did you know that cancer defends itself against attacks? How does Laetrile Kill Cancer Cells?
Tumors can become resistant to chemotherapy, radiation or whatever else you throw at it. It would make sense that if you could dismantle cancer's defenses, you could then take it out, right? What are the ways that cancer defends itself? One way is that tumors encapsulate themselves with blood vessels that are so restricted that antitumor agents can't get through. Another way is that tumors amass high concentrations of a substance called glutathione. Glutathione is the element that makes tumors resistant to treatment. Is there a way to lower the levels of glutathione in tumors so that they would become sensitized to anticancer treatments? The answer is yes. For glutathione to be produced in the cells, it needs another substance called cysteine.
Is there a way to lower the level of Cysteine?
Yes. Cyanide depletes the supply of cysteine.
Isn't cyanide a poison?
Cyanide is toxic to our body but it will not make us sick in very low doses derived from a whole food source. You eat cyanide-rich food everyday if you eat apricots, pineapples, apples, or any of the other thousand cyanide-toting foods found in nature. The cyanide in these foods is present in a nutrient called amygdalin. Amygdalin can release cyanide within malignant cells, depleting the supply of cysteine. As a result, the intracellular concentration of glutathione is diminished. This will sensitize the tumors to antitumor treatments including Ozone therapy, Lymphocyte treatments, and high dose vitamin-C.

The
cure for cancer: theory, history and treatment.
Townsend
Letter for Doctors and Patients; 6/1/2004; Fonorow, Owen R.
Overview
The
theory that malignant cancers are false-placentas was first formulated by the
Scottish embryologist John Beard in 1902. Beard found that substances secreted
by the pancreas would inhibit the growth of cancers before they develop but are
missing in the blood of cancer patients. These substances are the digestive
enzymes trypsin (and the trypsin precursor chymotrypsin). Replacing these
enzymes reportedly ""cures"" 100% of fast-growing cancers.
Theory
John
Beard was not a physician but a brilliant biologist whose main research interest
was the placenta. Beard made several crucial observations that led to his theory
of cancer. Using his microscope he observed that the trophoblast cells that
become the placenta looked like cancer cells. Beard then made the following
extraordinary observation: The placenta stops growing on day 56 of the human
pregnancy--on the same day the fetus' pancreas begins to function. He came to
the conclusion that the fetus' pancreas secreted something that stopped the
growth of the placenta and surmised that the same substance might stop the
growth of malignant cancer.
Beard
conducted experiments with the juices extracted from young animal pancreases to
test his hypothesis. These juices were injected into cancer tumors and the
tumors shrank in both animals and humans. Beard's work was published in JAMA and
he wrote a book on the enzyme therapy for cancer. Physicians tried (100 years
ago) to duplicate Beard's experimental results, but failed, and the work was
(almost) forgotten.
We
now know that ""delicate"" enzymes can lose their effectiveness if not
carefully extracted from young live stock. Even today, we are not able to
synthesize either trypsin or chymotrypsin, leading to the high cost of
supplements with these enzymes.
History
We
all begin our lives as a single cell. As the zygote divides into trillions of
progeny; not all cells become muscle, bone, teeth, connective or other tissue.
Some cells become the placenta, a trophoblastic layer of tissue that attaches to
the uterine wall during pregnancy. These cells are discarded with the placenta
after birth.
Beard,
the first to observe that placenta cells resemble cancer cells, also saw how
malignant cancers act in the same way that placenta cells act in the mother's
womb; they attach to the uterus and ""eat"" through it to obtain a blood
supply.
Beard
also found other out-of-place trophoblast cells in great numbers throughout the
body. These cells are placenta-like, do not differentiate into specific tissue,
but lie dormant. Beard called these cells ""germ"" cells. They have
properties similar to stem cells, and Beard believed that these cells are the
seeds of cancer.
Beard
theorized that as we age, the germ cells are likely to receive a signal that
causes them to begin growing. The conditions that induce growth might include a
hormonal message that the germ cells interpret as a pregnancy. The
estrogen-based hormonal signal that mimics pregnancy may be induced by physical
trauma, or for other unknown reasons. As this ""false-placenta"" begins
growing, unchecked, it becomes the malignant mass which the medical community
calls cancer.
Pancreas
to the Rescue
The
pancreas produces the protein dissolving enzymes trypsin (and its precursor
chymotrypsin) that Beard believed prevents germ cells from becoming malignant.
The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine, there they
help digest ""cooked"" or denatured proteins. Some of these enzymes
enter the bloodstream. In theory, when the pancreas is healthy, early-stage
cancers (false pregnancies) are destroyed (digested) by pancreatic enzymes in
the blood.
Beard
believed that when the health of the pancreas becomes impaired, should the
output of pancreatic enzymes decline, any malignant cancer cells that begin
dividing will grow out of control.
In
Beard's time it was believed that enzymes taken orally would not enter the
bloodstream. Even today there is controversy whether or not the large enzyme
molecules can be absorbed, and whether the enzyme molecule remains intact in the
stomach. Dr. Kelley's success rates tells us that the enzymes can be taken by
mouth, but that very large amounts are required to make them effective against
growing cancers.
An
important discovery is that trypsin's digestive enzyme action is activated by
the high pH (alkaline) environment in the small intestine. This finding may help
explain the effectiveness of the increasingly popular high-pH cesium treatment
for cancer.
Max
Wolf
In
the 1940s, researchers discovered that there was ""something"" in the
blood of people without cancer that was completely missing in the blood of
people who had cancer. This clue prompted Dr. Max Wolf to read Beard's book The
Enzyme Therapy for Cancer and Its Scientific Basis.
Dr.
Wolf along with his associate Helen Benitez and Dr. Karl Ransberger, a young
biomedical researcher from Germany, tested a large number of enzymes from animal
and plant sources. Wolf created an enzyme formula containing both trypsin and
chymotrypsin. Today, the Wolf/Benitez WoBenzyme[R] systemic enzyme formula is
reportedly the second hottest selling OTC product in Europe--behind ordinary
aspirin.
William
Kelley
In
1963, a dentist (William D. Kelley) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (almost
always quickly fatal) and he rediscovered the connection between pancreatic
enzymes and cancer remission. He cured his own cancer--and subsequently hundreds
more, but was vilified by the medical establishment and became embittered.
In
the 1980s, a young medical student--Nick Gonzalez--was sent by the
Sloan-Kettering cancer center to ""debunk"" Kelley's claim of a 100%
pancreatic-cancer cure rate. However, after revisiting Kelley's patient records,
Gonzalez became a believer. Dr. Gonzalez recently won a $6 million grant from
the National Institutes of Health to continue the study of enzyme therapy for
pancreatic cancer.
An
excellent overview of the history of enzyme therapy may be read at: http://www.herbtime.com/Information
Pages/CancerEnzymeTherapy.htm
Recent
Support
The
""laetrile"" clinics in Mexico claim that they have a ""100%""
cure rate for cancer. They do post a disclaimer: The 100% cure rate applies only
if the patient has not undergone chemotherapy or radiation--and only in those
patients that take the pancreatic enzymes.
If
cancers are really false placentas, malignant tumors would mimic pregnancy in
other ways. All trophoblast cells produce a unique hormone called the chorionic
gonadotrophic (CGH) which is easily detected in urine. Thus if a person is
either pregnant or has cancer, a simple CGH pregnancy test should confirm either
or both. It does, with high accuracy. Recent research has shown that all cancers
tested (80% of all known cancers) emit portions of this ""pregnancy""
hormone. See: http://www.ralphmoss.com/html/cach377.shtml
The
University of Michigan Cancer Center has recently proclaimed that current
chemotherapy targets the ""wrong"" cells. The Ann Arbor researchers
discovered that not all cells in a tumor are equally malignant. Only a tiny
minority of tumor cells are actually capable of inducing new cancers; the rest
are relatively harmless. ""These tumor-inducing cells have many of the
properties of stem cells,"" said Michael F. Clarke, MD, a professor of
internal medicine, who directed the study. ""They make copies of
themselves--a process called self-renewal--and produce all the other kinds of
cells in the original tumor.""
It
is clear then that the nation's top cancer center has unknowingly rediscovered
Beard's thesis.

the two-part series by Ralph Moss: Part 1--http://www.cancerdecisions.com/042603.html

Kelley
Enzymes
Dr.
William Kelley recommends high amounts of pancreatic enzymes--45,000 mg orally.
His formula includes a starch-dissolving enzyme which Kelley states is important
in some cases. The enzyme formula Kelley stands behind cost roughly $2000 per
month.
Unfortunately,
the larger the cancer mass--which quickly dissolves from oral enzyme
therapy--the harder it is for the liver/kidney to rid the body of the residue of
it. As a result, many patients taking enzymes die from toxemia as the cancer
tumor is digested. Various methods for detoxifying the liver are known, with the
""coffee enema"" being preferred. Toxemia is the primary reason to have
the malignant tumor mass surgically removed.
Treatments
If
the Beard theory is correct, malignant cancer only begins after the pancreas
fails to secrete sufficient trypsin and chymotrypsin to prevent it from growing.
A therapy that improves or restores the health of the pancreas, so that it can
again secrete these enzymes, would result in cancer remissions.
For
example, if the heavy metal mercury building up in the pancreas was the root
cause of the enzyme secretion problem, large amounts of vitamin C might cure a
cancer (cause remission) by ridding the pancreas of mercury. If a CoQ10
deficiency was the reason the pancreas was malfunctioning, then supplmenting
CoQ10 may restart the production of trypsin, etc. Beard's theory explains why
high-dose vitamin C or CoQ10 works in some people, and not in others.
Cesium
Protocol
There
are theoretical reasons and experimental findings that indicate fast-growing
cancers can be completely resolved by using a 6g cesium chloride salt for
30-days. The following 20-year-old paper describes the High pH Therapy for
Cancer treatment: http://www.mwt.net/~drbrewer/highpH.htm
Brewer
mentions the resemblance between embryonic cells and cancer cells. Another
connection between the high pH therapy and the enzyme therapy is the striking
coincidence that Brewer's therapy works by raising the pH of the cancer cell to
8.0 (highly alkaline). This is the same pH in the small intestine, and it is the
pH required to activate trypsin's digestive enzyme activity! (The author has
noted that stomach, colon and rectal cancer are all common--small intestine
cancer is rare.)
Cesium
is far less expensive than high-quality pancreatic enzymes. While it is unknown
whether or not the cesium protocol works in the complete absence of trypsin in
the blood, it is logical to assume that less pancreatic enzymes would be
required in conjunction with cesium treatment for cancer. (Perhaps 4,500 mg of
pancreatic enzymes with trypsin would suffice along with 6,000 mg cesium
chloride daily, rather than the 45,000 mg of pancreatic enzymes daily that
Kelley and Gonzalez recommend orally to destroy tumors.)
Experimental
science will one day provide the answer.
Rath
Vitamin C Protocol
There
is a sensible high-vitamin-C protocol that has been found to arrest cancer
growths. Not that it cures/digests the cancers, but according to former Linus
Pauling associate Matthias Rath, MD, this protocol restricts or halts the growth
of malignant tumors by deactivating an enzyme. The Rath protocol may be safer
than the Beard/Wolf/Kelley enzyme therapy--it may allow the body to more slowly
digest the tumors, or the tumor may calcify.
The
Rath therapy is thought to interfere with the enzyme that cancer tumors emit,
malignin, which allows the tumor to ""eat"" through ordinary tissue.
Malignin is the mirror image (sterioisomer) of trypsin.
The
daily protocol from Dr. Matthias Rath is reportedly:
14,000
mg Vitamin C
12,000
mg Lysine
2,000
mg Proline
1,000
mg Green Tea Extract (EGCG)
No
doubt, this vitamin-C protocol improves the health of the pancreas.
Coenzyme
Q10
There
are sound theoretical reasons to add 400 mg of highly absorbable Coenzyme 10
(CoQ10) to any anticancer protocol. This dosage has initiated complete tumor
regression in breast cancer patients--during clinical studies! Since the
pancreas has a high concentration of CoQ10, it may be that restoring CoQ10
levels improves pancreatic function. It is much more economical to repair the
health of your pancreas, if possible, than it is to buy 45,000 mg of daily
enzymes for life.
The
Basic Recommendations for Controlling Cancer
Many
enzyme authorities recommend against most orthodox Chemo/Radiation therapy in
favor of the following protocols:
1.
Have surgery to remove as much of the tumor mass as possible.
2.
Follow the Rath-Vitamin C/Lysine/EGCG protocol with 400 mg CoQ10.
3.
Purchase pancreatic enzymes (e.g. the Kelley or Wobenzyme oncologic formula).
The formula must contain trypsin and chymotrypsin. Start with 400 mg daily, and
slowly increase until effective.
4.
Follow the Brewer Cesium protocol (including laetrile--apricot seeds), for 30
days.
Brewer
Cesium Protocol
*
6 g cesium chloride (2000 mg a.m., 2000 mg noon, and 2000 mg evening)
*
100,000 IU Vitamin A
*
Up to 30,000 mg Vitamin C
*
Selenium--200 to 400 (mcg) MICRO grams
*
Zinc--50 mg
*
Laetrile (apricot seed extract)--150-200 mg
5.
Add a good mineral/multivitamin--to cover all possible nutritional needs.
6.
Supplement vitamin D (800 IU) and vitamin K (1 mg) (both have shown anti-cancer
properties in several studies)
7.
Avoid refined carbohydrates, especially sugars which feed cancer.
8.
Avoid supplemental calcium (!) (Calcium speeds the growth of embryos, and
perhaps cancer). Take supplemental magnesium/potassium
9.
Eat proteins every other day--to rest the pancreas.
The
following link to the Cancer Cure Booklet provides the scientific rationale for
the William Kelley enzyme therapy: http://www.road-to-health.com/am/publish/article_56.shtml
Other
orthomolecular substances are known to have anti-cancer activity. Some of these
include ginger, lysine/proline, lycopene, and r-alpha lipoic acid. If these
substances are effective, they may either help restore pancreatic function, or
help inhibit the growth and spread of the false-placenta.

Apricot kernels, Cancer and Vitamin B17 - Part 2
The orthodox theory of cancer
As most of us are aware, the conventional view of cancer is that the lump/tumour/growth
�is the cancer� and that this needs to be treated with surgery, chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, or perhaps hormonal or immunotherapy. The idea is that by shrinking
the growth, or cutting it out of the body, the cancer will be gone. This is unless
the cancer has metastasised (spread to other areas), in this case another course
of treatment may be suggested, or the patient may be told that the cancer has spread
too far and nothing more can be done.
The alternative theory of cancer
The alternative view is that the lump/tumour/growth �is not the cancer� but is the
�symptom� - a sign that something is going wrong with the natural balance of the body.
It is thought that once the underlying problem is corrected the growth will simply be
reabsorbed into the body. Although, it is agreed that if the growth is not reabsorbed
and is unsightly, or so large as to interfere with the normal functioning of a
particular area of the body, then it should be removed by surgery.
The growth is not considered to be 'pure cancer� - perhaps as little as 20% is
actually cancerous, with the remaining 80% being non-cancerous. It is suggested
that the cancerous area of the growth is more resistant to radiotherapy than the
noncancerous area and therefore less likely to be destroyed. In other words, the
growth may be reduced, but the cancer may still remain and can potentially spread.
If we injure ourselves a healing process starts and the affected cells are replaced
with new cells. However, it is thought that cancer is a healing process that has not
switched off. In other words, if the body is deficient in something that is essential
for homeostasis it may not work effectively and the healing process may just continue
going. The result is that the body will start to heal, and then heal again and again
until a growth finally appears.
There are apparently two lines of defense against this over-healing process and
the development of cancer. The first involves �Proteolytic enzymes� (enzymes designed
to digest protein), which are produced by the pancreas. The two proteolytic enzymes,
trypsin and chymotrypsin, dissolve the protective protein coating around cancer cells
and this effectively allows the body�s white blood cells in to attack and destroy
the cancer cells.
The second line of defense against cancer are substances known as nitrilosides.
(It is thought that there are more than 800 foods in the nitriloside family).
These nitriloside foods contain vitamin B17 (amygdalin) which is made up of four
components - two of glucose (sugar), one of benzaldehyde and one of cyanide. The
cancer cell wall has an enzyme called beta-glycosidase (also known as the
�unlocking enzyme�). When B17 (amygdalin) and the unlocking enzyme come into
contact the cancer cell is destroyed. It's interesting to note that beta-glycosidase
is found in cancer cells, and in no other cell in the body (therefore, no other cell
can be destroyed). As author G. Edward Griffin points out in his 2005 presentation �
�this is an amazing mechanism of nature that could not have been accidental�.
(See references and links below).
Therefore, in this alternative view of cancer, there is no �cure� because cancer
is in fact all part of the natural physiological processes of the body. It is only
when the healing cells are allowed to develop unchecked, and our natural lines of
defense are down, that it becomes a problem. Some people even feel that we probably
develop cancer over and over again during our lives, but on most occasions our
defense systems simply deal with it � we never know we have had cancer.
This theory seems to be backed up by G. Edward Griffin�s fascinating explanation
of the cattle on America�s mid-west farms. In an interview for FHV (A Norwegian
consumer health freedom organization) Griffin explains the following: In the mid-west
part of the united states farmers found that, in the winter months, their cattle would
develop cancers in their mouths. However, as the snow melted away and the spring came
along, the cattle would start to eat the broad-leafed grasses (rich in B17) and the
cancers would simply disappear.
Q & A�s
If this theory of cancer is really true, why doesn�t my doctor know about it ?
This is a controversial subject because there seem to be a number of conflicting or
competing interests involved. You might like to watch the second part of G.Edward
Griffins explanation of the politics of cancer for a full understanding of why this
information appears not to have filtered down to doctors and GP�s. You can find this
in the references and links section under: The Science and Politics of Cancer 2005,
Parts 4 � 7, The politics of cancer therapy: The Pharmaceutical Cartel.
If we have two lines of defense to prevent cancer why would both of these fail ?
It seems that our modern diets, full of animal fats and dairy products, use up huge
amounts of pancreatic enzymes in order to break down this type of food - thereby depleting
stocks when they are needed to combat cancer. There are also other reasons, such as having
a condition like �diabetes�, where the pancreas is often weakened and therefore less able
to produce these necessary enzymes. There may also be a hereditary factor where, again,
the pancreas is weak and therefore unable to function fully or correctly from birth.
The breakdown of our second line of defense may simply be due to the lack of foods
from the nitriloside family. Many of these foods often have a bitter taste and therefore
may be avoided by most people - consequently they become less available in conventional
supermarkets over time. Although, there is also the problem of foods such as bread that
used to contain �Millet flour� (rich in B17/amygdalin), but now mainly contain the
cheaper �wheat flour�.
Can cancer be cured ?
The conventional view would be that scientists are definitely looking for a �cure� for cancer.
However, the alternative view of cancer seems to show that it is potentially a metabolic disease
caused by natural deficiencies and therefore we need to introduce nitriloside foods back into the
diet for the rest of our lives and perhaps think about modifying our diets. This is why people
who are concerned about cancer may be focusing on apricot kernels - a food very high in B17/amygdalin.
Many people who hold the alternative view of cancer would compare it to a metabolic disease such
as scurvy. Scurvy was only resolved by taking vitamins C, as most people know. However, vitamins
C could not be said to be the �cure� for scurvy because in order to keep the disease at bay you
clearly need to consume foods rich in vitamins C for the rest of your life. A �cure� implies that
you just need to correct the problem once and then it is resolved.
Are there other factors involved in the development of cancer ?
Yes, it would seem that toxins in our environment and toxins that we take into the body might
produce a healing response in the areas that are affected by these toxins. For example, we may
damage the lungs if we smoke and this could provoke an over-healing response - which may then
not switch off if we are deficient in proteolytic enzymes or nitriloside foodstuffs. This could
explain why some people who smoke develop cancer, whilst others don�t.
Are there therapists who can use the alternative approach if someone already has cancer ?
Yes, we believe that there are therapists who may be able to help. You could try the �Gerson Support Group UK�
or the �Gerson Institute� - or perhaps the� World Without Cancer� website. (Although, we must stress that
�The Velvet Mind� and �Andersen Counselling� has no affiliation with any of the websites (or publications)
mentioned in this article and do not give medical advice of any kind).
Why is it sometimes suggested that people should eat pineapple and papaya melons to keep cancer at bay?
It�s our understanding that these particular fruits mimic the action of some of
the proteolytic enzymes � thereby dissolving
the protein coating of the cancer cell. Papaya melons as a source of the enzyme papain, and pineapple as a source of the
enzyme bromelain.
Are there any books I can buy that show me how to include nitriloside foods in my diet ?
Yes, in 1976 a lady called June de Spain (former toxicologist and a pharmacologist for the Federal Food and Drug
Administration in the U.S) wrote a book called �The little cyanide cookbook � delicious recipes rich in vitamin B17�.
There was quite a bit of controversy surrounding the writing of this book and her work for the FDA at the time �
you might want to search �Google� to learn more .I believe her book is still available through the �World without Cancer�
website or �Amazon UK�.

No. 26568 - State of West Virginia v. Donna Jean Poling
Starcher, J., dissenting:
I dissent from the majority opinion because I believe that the circuit court was wrong to
deny Donna Jean Poling (and her doctor) the right to tell the jury why Ms. Poling was growing marijuana.
It seems clear to me that a criminal defendant should ordinarily always be able to tell the
jury why the defendant did something that may be a crime -- for two basic reasons. First, it
could be that a defendant didn't have the state of mind necessary to make the act that they performed a
crime. Suppose that a criminal defendant told the jury: “I drove through the red light because there was
a train coming right at me;” or “I shot him because he had beaten me for years and I thought if I didn't, he
was about to beat me again;” or “I took the money from her bureau because she had stolen the money
from me the week before.”
In each case, if a jury believed what the defendant said about why they performed the acts,
the defendant might not be found guilty of the crime of reckless driving, murder, or theft.
Why not?
Because the defendant did not have the criminal intent, the state of mind, that may be
necessary to make the act that they performed into a crime. And, it simply makes no sense, nor is it fair,
to not permit a person charged with a criminal offense to explain or tell why that person did whatever he
or she may have done.
Donna Jean Poling is a 34-year old, married mother of four children who suffers from
multiple sclerosis. In her initial statement to the police, given on March 30,
1999, at the conclusion of the search of her home, Donna Poling admitted that she was
growing marijuana. In response to the question by Deputy Wilfong, “Can you tell me about
the marijuana that was growing in the house?”, she replied, “I smoke it because I have M.S.,
I'm not a drug dealer. I smoke it for medical reasons.” Thereafter, there occurred several
informal discussions between the prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant
surrounding the defendant's use of marijuana as treatment for multiple sclerosis.
The prosecutor decided to proceed with the case, and Ms. Poling's trial was set
on February 5, 1999. On January 21, 1999, the State filed a Motion in Limine seeking to
prohibit any testimony or defense based on the medicinal qualities of marijuana upon
multiple sclerosis.See footnote 1
1
On February 4, 1999, the defendant filed a response to the Motion in
Limine by the State. The defendant argued that she should be able to put on her testimony,
documentation, and treating physician's testimony regarding her use of marijuana in the
treatment of her multiple sclerosis, under the criminal defenses of compulsion or medical
necessity. The trial judge denied her that right.
Multiple sclerosis is a serious, progressive disease that will render Donna
Poling paralyzed at some time, and will eventually kill her. She was diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis in the late 1980's, and was at that time suffering tingling, pain, and an inability to
urinate. From 1990-1995 she suffered temporary blindness, severe headaches, dizziness,
additional tingling, pain, loss of muscle control, muscle weakness, loss of bladder function,
and spasticity of her limbs.
During this time period she tried several prescription drugs (all those suggested
by her treating physicians), including specifically Prednisone and Betaseron. These
prescription drugs did not prevent the onset of the symptoms of her disease, nor did they
lessen the symptoms. Additionally, the side effects of the medications were causing severe
bruising, depression, and anger.
She attended counseling at the local community health center in an attempt to
get treatment for the depression and anger. Ms. Poling's legal medications were costing up
to $1,000 per month and were only partially covered ($200 per month) under the health
insurance policy that the family maintained through her husband's employment.
During this time Donna Poling continued to suffer two or more outbreaks of
severe symptoms lasting 3 to 4 months in each year, which is typical of this disease. In
August of 1995 Donna Poling read in a national publication entitled “Real Living with
Multiple Sclerosis” that some people had been using marijuana to offset the symptoms of
multiple sclerosis. She decided to try it. After beginning the use of marijuana as a treatment,
she was symptom-free for almost 3 years.
She first began growing marijuana in the late fall or winter of 1997, to avoid
purchasing the illegal drug. Her first plants were the plants seized by the Tucker County
sheriff's department on March 30, 1998.
She smoked marijuana two to three times a week, in the evening, in her
bathroom, away from her children and husband. Her children were aware that she used
marijuana as a treatment for her disease and were also aware that it is not something to be
done for pleasure. After her arrest in March of 1998, Donna Poling suffered her first return
of symptoms. She is very afraid that the debilitating symptoms of her disease will return for
good.
So, in Ms. Poling's case, if the jury believed that she truly grew marijuana
because she, a victim of multiple sclerosis, believed that she really needed it as a matter of
medical necessity, to prevent blindness and paralysis, the jury could have found that she did
not have a criminal state of mind -- even though she performed the act of growing
marijuana.See footnote 2
2
The second reason that a defendant should be able to tell the jury why they did
something that may be a crime is simple fairness. It simply isn't fair, to a jury or to a
defendant, for a person not to be able to explain why they did something -- even something
that may be a criminal act.
Juries are not machines -- they are the conscience of the community. To make
a conscientious decision, a jury needs to see a complete picture. For this reason, asbestos
companies, if they want to, should be able to tell a jury why they covered up the fact that
their product causes cancer. Even spouse-batterers should be able to tell a jury why they
beat their spouses -- and drunk drivers should be able to tell a jury why they got drunk and
ran into someone.
People have the right to a fair and just day in court. If we don't let people at
least explain why they did something, a courtroom can seem to be a grossly unfair and unjust
place. And our court system must be ultimately about fairness and justice, or our citizens
will simply lose faith in their courts.
I have little personal sympathy for drug use of any sort, except to treat real
diseases. I am and have always been pretty close to a tee-totaller. Although I went to college
in the 1960's, I never tried marijuana or other illegal drugs. In fact, I was a non-drinking
president of my college fraternity. I've probably drunk less than a full bottle of wine in my
life, and I have never even tasted beer or whiskey. I tried tobacco as a kid, but I have never
been a smoker, chewer, or dipper.
But not everyone is as abstinent as I am. Sure, some of the most wicked
people I have encountered have been people who used and abused tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana and other drugs. But it is also true that many otherwise law-abiding, hardworking,
and honest people use tobacco, alcohol, marijuana,See footnote 3

and other drugs.
Personally, I wish that they wouldn't -- but I also personally question whether
in all cases their drug use should make them into criminals.
I recognize that all of the truly addictive/dangerous drugs that are in common
use -- like alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, and opiates -- can and do
cause large amounts of personal and family suffering and social harm.
However, experience teaches us that criminalizing the adult use of such drugs
generally does nothing but make the situation worse. For example, we already tried
prohibition with alcohol, and that “Noble Experiment” caused our grandparents and great-
grandparents many of the same sorts of problems that our current “drug war” is causing for
us.
Most experts agree that our society needs to move toward a
treatment/medical/education model to deal with addictive/dangerous drug use -- and to move
away from the criminal justice model. I know that many people in law enforcement are very
discouraged and troubled because society is asking them to fight a war that is not really
winnable in the criminal justice system, and that is causing a huge drain on our social
resources.See footnote 4

The final decision whether or not to criminalize certain drug use is one to be
made by our Legislature, of course. But it is this Court that has the right and the duty to
decide what a defendant can tell a jury about why they committed an act that may be a crime.
I think that Donna Jean Poling had that right.
I have included in an appendix to this dissent a discussion of the “medical
necessity” legal defense in marijuana cases, that is taken from a website on marijuana law
reform -- http://www.norml.org/legal/med.defense.shtml. The discussion summarizes the
legal position of those who contend that the medical necessity defense should be available
in some marijuana criminal cases.
I do not necessarily agree with all of the statements in the discussion that I
have placed in the appendix. But I do believe that under the correct view of the law, our
Legislature's criminalization of marijuana cannot and does not entirely preclude a person like
Ms. Long from using the “medical necessity” defense -- especially where a doctor will testify
that a person needs this drug.
For example, if the Legislature passed a law that said that aspirin has no
medical benefits, and made possessing aspirin into a crime, I still don't think that our law
could prohibit a person in pain from explaining to the jury that they needed aspirin to deal
with their pain.
That is to say, I don't believe that the Legislature can repeal the laws of nature
-- and I don't think they intended to.
We are, as a society, slowly learning that there are no simple answers in
creating more effective strategies to reduce social and personal harm from drugs. I believe
that the young people who may read this dissent have the courage that it takes to face facts
and build a better future. Because I believe in those young people, I do not despair -- even
though the majority's decision in this case is not what I think is right.See footnote 5

The majority decision could be seen as cruel and short-sighted. I dissent.
APPENDIX
Although an increasing number of states are enacting statutes permitting
seriously ill people to use marijuana legally for medicinal purposes, the majority of states
still provide no prospective access to marijuana for medical use. In states where affirmative
rights to use marijuana for medicinal purposes have not been enacted, individuals may still
be prosecuted for possessing or using marijuana for treatment of their medical condition.
When these prosecutions occur, raising the medical necessity defense may provide a means
of avoiding a criminal conviction.
The “medical necessity defense” is usually grounded in either a state's
common law or general necessity defense statute. Regardless of its origin, the basis of the
necessity defense is that society is sometimes willing to excuse or even justify what would
otherwise be illegal conduct that was done to avoid an even worse or greater evil.{1} In
doing so, the defense reflects society's understanding that sometimes forces beyond a
person's control place the person in an emergency situation where he or she must choose
between the harm or “evil” of breaking the criminal code or complying with the code and
allowing an even greater harm or “evil” to occur. In these situations, if a person violates the
law in order to avoid the greater harm, the defense of necessity excuses the person from
being guilty of what would otherwise be a crime.
“The pressure of natural physical forces sometimes confronts a person in an
emergency with a choice of two evils: either he may violate the literal terms of the criminal
law and thus produce a harmful result, or he may comply with those terms and thus produce
a greater or equal or lesser amount of harm. For reasons of social policy, if the harm which
will result from compliance with the law is greater than that which will result from
[violating] it, he is by virtue of the defense of necessity justified in violating it.” {2} The
logic behind the defense is similar to the logic prohibiting the imposition of civil liability in
situations where a person or property is harmed to avoid a greater harm. {3} Stated
differently, the defense applies where the individual actor determines that any reasonable
person in his or her situation would find the personal consequences of violating the law less
severe than the consequences of compliance. {4} “While the act itself is voluntary in the
sense that the actor consciously decides to do it, the decision is dictated by the absence of an
acceptable alternative.” {5} “Traditionally, the defense of necessity has been characterized as being either
a justification of or an excuse for criminal activity.” {6} While the differences between the
two exist {7}, they share the common result of negating criminal liability. Whether applied
as a justification or excuse, the defense furthers the belief that people should not be punished
for actions taken which were not of their own free will. {8} “Penalizing one who acted rationally to avoid a greater harm will serve neither
to rehabilitate the offender nor to deter others from acting similarly when presented with
similar circumstances.” {9} Rather than discussed in terms of necessity, “[t]he matter is often
expressed in terms of choice of evils: When the pressure of circumstances presents one with
a choice of evils, the law prefers that he avoid the greater evil by bringing about the lesser
evil.” {10} For similar reasons, necessity defenses are sometimes labeled “competing
harms.” {11} Under such circumstances, the evil brought about from violating the law is
deemed to be less than the evil which would have resulted from literal compliance with the
law.
For example, suppose Tom sees a little girl drowning in a backyard pool as he
walks down his neighborhood sidewalk. Suppose further that Tom sees a sign between
himself and the little girl which says, “No Trespassing Violators Will Be Prosecuted.” Tom
is now confronted with a choice. He can comply with the law and the little girl will drown,
or he can break the law of trespass and avoid the greater evil of a little girl senselessly dying.
If Tom were to be charged with trespass after choosing to save the little girl, he could raise
the defense of necessity in order to avoid what would otherwise be a crime because the harm
which Tom sought to avoid, the little girl's death, was greater than the harm resulting from
violating the law against trespassing.
In the medical necessity context {12}, courts are required to balance the
interest of an individual in his or her health and welfare against the government's interest in
upholding the criminal law. {13} When the medicinal use of marijuana is in question, “... the
court must balance the defendant's interest in preserving his health against the State's interest
in regulating the drug involved.” {14} In order to successfully present the defense in this
context, the defendant will typically be required to convince the court that their health is
threatened to the degree that engaging in otherwise criminal activity is warranted. Although
the specific requirements vary from state to state {15}, this usually requires a person using
marijuana for medicinal purposes to show that they acted under the reasonable belief that
their marijuana use was necessary to avoid serious medical harm. {16} Medical testimony
and evidence from a treating physician or medical expert is almost, if not always required to
support the claim. {17} In at least one case, the absence of medical testimony prohibited the
defense from being presented. {18}
The harm sought to be avoided must be more serious or greater than the harm
or “evil” of breaking the applicable marijuana law. This aspect of the defense requires the
judge or jury to evaluate the severity of the harm that would result without marijuana use as
compared to the harm of violating the marijuana law. While it is difficult to anticipate what
judges or juries will decide in a given case, the more severe the personal harm an individual
is seeking to avoid, the greater the chance a judge or jury will decide the individual's efforts
to avoid it where appropriate. Most importantly, the defense affords individuals the
opportunity to present evidence of marijuana's ability to minimize the effects of their disease
or illness. For example, in Washington v. Diana {19}, “[t]he defendant, a victim of multiple
sclerosis, testified as to his belief that marijuana was a 'primary sedative' for the
'frustrations' caused by multiple sclerosis. While no argument was presented to the trial court
concerning a medical necessity defense, the appellate court, in the 'interests of justice,'
remanded the matter so that the issue could be fully determined. The court was cognizant that
a necessity defense is generally available only when the physical forces of nature cause the
accused to take unlawful action to avoid harm which social policy deems greater than that
which results from a violation of the law. It determined nonetheless that the defendant should
be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate the potential beneficial effects of marijuana on
the symptoms of multiple sclerosis.” {20}
Many jurisdictions also require that there be no other available options for the
individual to avoid the harm. For example, in Idaho, the defense is not applicable where the
compelling circumstances have been brought about by the accused or where a legal
alternative is available to the accused. {21} In other words, if a viable, legal alternative
treatment to marijuana exists, the individual cannot claim necessity as a defense. The
reasoning behind this result is that because a legal means of avoiding the harm exists,
violating the law is not necessary.
Technically, the defense is only applicable when there are no legal means of
avoiding the harm. However one court accepted the viability of the medical necessity defense
to marijuana possession in a glaucoma case where surgery, though risky, was nonetheless a
possible alternative course of treatment. {22} Where the element is strictly required, it is
likely to be contested. The prosecution and the individual frequently disagree about whether
a legal alternative exits. Medical experts are used by both sides and the question is left for
the judge or jury to decide. As one court reasoned, for medical conditions “[o]bjective
standards of proof can be developed without undue hardship, since the existence of a disease
and its response to the drug can be demonstrated scientifically.” {23} Although the current law of necessity in some states technically limits
marijuana's medicinal use to situations where individuals have no other alternative, the law
is usually applied in a more compassionate manner. NORML believes that marijuana laws
should reflect the inherent rights of individuals to choose their own course of treatment as
is reflected in other legal contexts. This reasoning was used by the court in applying the
medical necessity defense to marijuana possession in United States v. Randall and further
suggests that medical decisions be left to individuals entirely. For example, the abortion
cases of Roe v. Wade {24} and Doe v. Bolton {25} stress the fundamental nature of an
individual's right to preserve and control their own bodies. {26} These decisions allow a
woman to terminate a pregnancy at any stage in which the mothers own existence is
threatened. {27} The importance of these cases in the medical necessity context is their
demonstration of just how “far-reaching is the right of an individual to preserve their health
and bodily integrity.” {28} According to the court in Randall, justification for using
marijuana is even more easily arrived at because, unlike the situations in Doe and Roe, “...
no direct harm will be visited upon innocent third parties; any major ill effects from the
inhalation of marijuana smoke will occur to the defendant alone.” {29} The Randall court
went on to state that individuals growing marijuana for their own personal consumption do
not contribute to the illegal trafficking of the drug and therefore are not injuring innocent
members of the public. {30} The Randall court also considered the reasoning of Stowe v. United States
{31}, an unreported civil case. In Stowe, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the FDA from
preventing their cancer suffering spouses from receiving laetrile, a drug banned by the FDA
because whether it was an effective cancer treating drug as unresolved. {32} The district
court enjoined the defendants because “... the plaintiff's right to medical treatment with a
substance which had demonstrably favorable effects on their cancers superseded any interest
of the government in protecting the general public from a drug whose properties were not
conclusively proven.” {33} This right to medical treatment was the basis for the district court
enjoining the FDA from preventing the plaintiffs from importing laetrile for their own use.
{34}
*****
The requirement that no legal alternative be available may mean that the
defense is no longer available in states where marijuana can be legally obtained for medical
purposes. If marijuana is needed, the appropriate statute must be complied with in order to
possess the substance. Individuals who illegally obtain marijuana will have considerable
difficulty showing that illegal possession is necessary when a legal method is readily
available. Another requirement for the defense is that the state legislature has not precluded
the necessity defense's applicability to a given set of circumstances. As the number of
medical marihuana cases increases, the possibility exists that a state legislature could amend
their necessity defense statute to exclude the medical use or medical marijuana use defense.
NORML intends to vigorously discourage any such attempt and to continue advocating the
implementation of procedures for prospective access to marijuana for medicinal purposes.
Regrettably, a small number of state courts have ruled that the defense is not
applicable in their state. Insufficient testimony regarding the medical need of the defendant
and an unwillingness to meddle with the authority of the legislature were the most often
articulated reasons for refusing to apply the defense.
For example, a Georgia court ruled there are no affirmative defenses to the
possession or dissemination of marijuana for medical, health, or therapeutical purposes. {35}
The court cited concerns that the benefits of marijuana treatment or therapy had not been
medically or scientifically recognized and expressed concerns about infringing upon the role
of the legislature. {36} According to the Court, the question of whether the use of marijuana
for medical purposes constitutes a defense must be answered by the legislature. {37} “These
are issues involving safety, health and community morals within the police power of the state
posing questions for resolution by the General Assembly rather than by the courts. For us to
rule otherwise would be a usurpation of a legislative prerogative.” {38} While this result is
disappointing, the fact that reliable scientific evidence continues to mount suggests that even
in Georgia, if courts will not take action, perhaps the General Assembly will.
Even where the defense does apply, it is subject to change because medical
research continues to find new medicinal uses for marijuana. As is true with any medication
or course of treatment, whether marijuana is an appropriate means of treatment is a decision
which should be thoughtfully made with the consultation of a physician.

{7} Where the defense is considered a justification, the criminal nature of the prohibited
activity is negated. Randall at 2251. This conclusion is based upon the concept that
criminality is derived from combining a prohibited act with an evil mind. Id. “Where the
criminal act was compelled by outside circumstances rather than through the exercise of the
actor's free will, the requisite criminal intent is considered to be lacking.” Id. The absence
of free will renders the crime incomplete because the actor did not have an evil mind while
committing the act. Id. Because the requisite mental element is missing, the actor is relieved
of criminal responsibility. Further, because anyone similarly situated would be equally
without evil intent, the justification applies to all those so situated. Id. Necessity has also
been applied in the form of an excuse. Id. “Under this view, criminal responsibility arises
upon the performance of every willed action, regardless of the underlying reason for the
choice. The actor may be excused from punishment for public policy reasons but not because
he was without blame. Here, unlike jurisdictions applying the defense as a justification, all
of the elements of the crime are present. But although guilt is established punishment is not
required because of extenuating circumstances which mitigate the seriousness of the offense.
Under this theory, the necessity defense must be applied on a case by case basis rather than
by reason of a general rule.” Id.

{12} It is important to note that the necessity defense does not apply in non-medical drug
possession cases. “The courts have consistently refused to acknowledge a nonmedical
necessity (or “choice of evils”) defense in a state narcotics prosecution. Most often, the
theory is rejected on the grounds that the defendant could have avoided the “emergency” at
issue by taking advance precautions, or could have utilized a legal alternative to committing
the subject crime. “Economic” necessity does not act as a defense to a state narcotics action,
either, or will “nonphysical” forces create a “choice of evils situation.” 1 A.L.R.5th 938
(1992).
{13} See Randall at 2252.
{14} State v. Diana, 604 P.2d 1312, 1317 (Wash.App.Ct, 1979).
{15} For example, under New York Law the medical necessity defense requires the
defendant to show: “1) the defendant acted under a reasonable belief, supported by medical
evidence, that his or her action was necessary as an emergency measure to avert an imminent
public or private injury; 2) the defendant's actions did not create the crisis; 3) it is clearly
more desirable to avoid the public or private injury caused by violating the statute; 4) there
are no available options; and 5) prior legislative action does not preclude the defense and
defendant's actions are not based only upon considerations of the morality and advisability
of the statute violated. People v. Bordowitz, 588 N.Y.S.2d 507, 511 (Criminal Court of the
City of New York, New York County, Jury 5, 1991). Other jurisdictions require less in order
to make a prima facie showing of the defense's applicability. Washington state allows a
medical necessity defense where the court finds: “the defendant reasonably believed his use
of marijuana was necessary to minimize the effects of [a medical condition]; 2) the benefits
derived from its use are greater than the harm sought to be prevented by the controlled
substances law; and 3) no drug is as effective in minimizing the effects of the disease. State
v. Diana, 604 P.2d 1312, 1317 (Ct. App. Wash. 1979). Washington also requires medical
testimony to corroborate the defendant's assertion that he or she reasonably believed their
actions were necessary to protect their health. State v. Diana, 604 P.2d 1312, 1317 (Court of
Appeals of Washington 1979). It is worth mentioning that while articulating these general
requirements, the court also emphasized that the defense “... exists only under very limited
circumstances not present in the routine case involving controlled substances.” State v.
Diana, 604 P.2d 1312, 1317 (Court of Appeals of Washington 1979). A similar approach was
taken in State v. Hastings, 801 P.2d 563 (Idaho 1990) where the court allowed a defendant
charged with felony possession of marijuana was entitled to assert a defense of necessity
under Idaho Code 733-116. “The defendant argued that the marijuana plants found growing
in her basement during a police search were medically necessary to control pain caused by
her rheumatoid arthritic condition. While the court refused to create a special defense of
'medical necessity,' it ruled that the defendant, upon remand to the trial court, was entitled
to introduce evidence related to the common law defense of necessity. 1 A.L.R.5th 938
(1992), State v. Hastings, 801 P.2d 563 (Idaho 1990). The elements of the defense were: (1)
a specific threat of immediate harm; (2) that the same objective could not have been
accomplished by less offensive alternatives; and (3) that the harm caused was not
disproportionate to the harm avoided. State v. Hastings, 801 P.2d 563 (Idaho 1990).
While unwilling to create a special medical necessity defense, other courts hold that the
medical use of marijuana is covered under the common law necessity defense. See State v.
Hastings, 801 P.2d 563, 364 (Idaho 1990). The elements of the common law defense are: 1)
A specific threat of immediate harm; 2) The circumstances which necessitate the illegal act
must not have been brought about by the defendant; 3) The same objective could not have
been accomplished by a less offensive alternative available to the actor; 4) The harm caused
was not disproportionate to the harm avoided. State v. Hastings, 801 P.2d 563, 364 (Idaho
1990); see also E. Arnolds & N. Garland, The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The
Right to Choose the Lesser Evil, 65 J.Crim.Law & Criminology 289, 294 (1974); C. Kenny,
Outlines of Criminal Law, 68-70 (1907); United States v. Moore, 486 F.2d 1139 (D.C.Cir.
1978). Perhaps the broadest application of the defense occurred in People v. Bordowitz, 588
N.Y.S.2d 507 (1991 City Crim Ct). “Defendants in prosecution for criminal possession of
hypodermic instrument were not guilty where their defense that they were engaged in needle
exchange program justified by exigencies created by AIDS epidemic fell within medical
necessity defense. Defendants did not create AIDS crisis; harm defendants sought to avoid--
spread of AIDS virus-- was greater than harm of violating the statute; there were no
meaningful available options since there were insufficient drug treatment programs in city
and no reason to believe that more treatment slots would come into existence in the near
future; no legislative or executive action precluded necessity defense in this case; and
medical evidence indicated that use of clean needle by addicts prevents the spread of HIV
infection. 1 A.L.R.5th 938 (1992), People v. Bordowitz, 588 N.Y.S.2d 507 (1991 City Crim
Ct).
In more general terms, Section 3.02 of the Model Penal Code provides:
Justification Generally: Choice of Evils.
1) Conduct to which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid a harm or evil to himself or
to another is justifiable, provided that:
a) the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be
prevented by the law defining the offense charged; and
b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses
dealing with the specific situation involved; and
c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.
2) When the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the situation requiring a choice
of harms or evils or in appraising the necessity of his conduct, the justification afforded by
this Section is unavailable in a prosecution for any offense for which recklessness or
negligence , as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.
{16} Although the underlying rationale for the rule is largely uniform, the actual elements
of the defense vary among jurisdictions. Consequently, practitioners are strongly advised to
consult the case law of the particular jurisdiction in preparing to present the defense.
{17} For example, Washington requires medical testimony to corroborate the defendant's
assertion that he or she reasonably believed their actions were necessary to protect their
health. Washington v. Diana, 604 P.2d 1312, 1317 (Wash.App.Ct. 1979)
{18} See State v. Bachman, 595 P.2d 287 (Hawaii, 1979). “While the court considered it
'entirely possible' that medical necessity could be asserted as a defense to a marijuana
possession charge in a 'proper case' (pursuant to HRS 703-302), such a defense would
require proof of the beneficial effects of marijuana use on the defendant's condition by
competent medical testimony, as well as the absence or ineffectiveness of more conventional
medical alternatives. The court emphasized that relief from 'simple discomfort' would not
suffice. Instead, the court said, the harm to which defendant is exposed must be 'serious' and
'imminent.' The court noted, as well, that a statutory vehicle existed in the jurisdiction
whereby marijuana was available through prescription by a licensed medical practitioner.”

2For a full discussion of how the legal doctrine of “medical necessity” can take away
the criminal state of mind, see the appendix to this dissent. I think that a Tucker County jury
was entitled to hear from a medical doctor how Ms. Poling reasonably felt that she needed
marijuana to prevent the serious symptoms of her disease. About a month after this case was
argued before this Court, the following news was reported in USA Today:
Researchers Link Marijuana And The Suppression Of
Multiple Sclerosis
London, England: Researchers at the University College of
London have found a link between marijuana and the
suppression of multiple sclerosis. The research, led by David
Baker, studied mice suffering from chronic allergic
encephalomyelitis, an animal autoimmune model for multiple
sclerosis, and said a synthetic form of tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) ameliorated the mice's symptoms by reducing tremors
and spasticity. The compounds injected into the mice stimulated
Cannabinoid receptors on the surface of nerve cells. Testing on
humans has not begun, but the results from this latest study are
encouraging. “This lends credence to the anecdotal reports that
some people with multiple sclerosis have said that cannabis can
help control these distressing symptoms,” said Lorna Layward,
one of the study's authors and head of research at the Multiple
Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
And in another far-off land, Malaysia, we read how a court was helped to make a
decision, with expert testimony on the medical use of marijuana by Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
a Harvard Medical School professor:
[Dr. Grinspoon's] first stop was the grim fortress like Pudu
Prison, where he examined the young man and found him, not
surprisingly, terrified, depressed, and subject to muscle spasms
in his arm and shoulder. Over the next several days, Grinspoon
worked with the defendant's Malaysian Attorney, giving him an
education in the medical-necessity defense. After Grinspoon
had walked the man through the 3,000 year history of cannabis,
recounting its widespread medical use from the beginning of the
written word up through 1937, the lawyer was openmouthed.
He immediately began making phone calls to influential
Malaysian doctors and lawyers and arranged for them to hear
the same lecture the next night. They, too, were amazed.
Grinspoon told them that a ground breaking study of the
medicinal uses of cannabis was based on observations made
right there in Malaysia and India in 1839.
But when the legal team reached the courthouse the next
morning, they were almost blown out of the water before
Grinspoon could open his mouth. The lawyer introduced his
American expert, and the judge exploded. “Why have you
brought this man halfway around the globe to testify when it has
been established that the defendant possessed 265.7 grams of
cannabis and the punishment is prescribed?”
Reluctantly, since Grinspoon had already made the trip, the
judge agreed to let him speak, even though it was obviously
pointless. But as with the audience of the night before, the
judge's skepticism melted, he became intrigued, and finally
brushed the lawyer aside and began questioning the witness
himself. Grinspoon told him the defendant was one of
thousands of people who claim that marijuana is the best thing
they can find for controlling the kind of painful spasms
associated with quadriplegia, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic
nerve injury.
After lunch, it was the prosecutor's turn. Grinspoon had been
warned that the state was anxious to swing this young American
from the yardarm and they did not look kindly on this
intervention. In his opening volley, the prosecutor threatened to
have Grinspoon himself arrested and thrown in prison for not
following procedures, then waded into him with a withering
barrage of questions. Unfortunately, the questions turned out to
be based on misinformation, and each response from the
professor steam-rolled the prosecutor with a roll call of
references to the scientific literature. After an hour of this, the
infuriated official said, “Dr. Grinspoon, all that you have
reported here about the capacity of cannabis to relieve suffering
of one type or another comes from papers and journals! What
has been your experience in observing this for yourself?”
Wrong question. To a courtroom now packed with late arrivals
who had heard of the furious duel, Grinspoon traced his
experience back to that day in 1967 when his 10 year old son
was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia. At first, he said,
Danny was good-natured about the treatments, but by 1971, he
was involved in major chemotherapy and Grinspoon and his
wife found themselves subjected to heart-wrenching scenes at
the hospital. “He would start to vomit shortly after treatment
and continue retching for up to eight hours. He vomited in the
car as we drove home, and when we got there he had to lie in
bed with his head over a bucket on the floor.”
Then one day Grinspoon arrived at the hospital and found his
wife and son already there. They were uncommonly relaxed and
it was obvious something was up. He was shocked to see his
son take the medicine without a fight, and after it was over there
was no sign of nausea. Instead of throwing up in the car, Danny
asked if they could stop off for a submarine sandwich. When
they got home, Grinspoon pulled his wife aside. She admitted
she had stopped by the school yard on the way to the hospital
and one of Danny's pals had given them a marijuana cigarette.
She and Danny had smoked it together before the session.

3It is not only “liberals” who are recognizing that the myths of marijuana are
unfounded. Ronald Reagan protege Dick Chase Eldredge has written:
One of the major knocks on marijuana is that it causes
otherwise productive, energetic people to become slothful and
unmotivated. Evidence does not support that conclusion. Large
numbers of successful, energetic people indulge with no external
negative consequences other than the risk of legal sanctions.
Another common myth about marijuana is that it serves as a
gateway to other drugs; that most cocaine users once smoked
pot is offered as support for this position. Most heroin users
once drank alcohol, but no one charges alcohol with being
gateway to heroin. The reason for this inconsistency is that
marijuana does not enjoy the social acceptance of alcohol and is
therefore a politically convenient target for such allegations. It
may be that marijuana users are more likely than the population
at large to use cocaine -- because the black-market supply
networks for the two drugs overlap. There is nothing in the
pharmacology of marijuana that would make a user more or less
likely to indulge in another substance.
*****
In spite of hundreds of cases where patients have been helped
by marijuana, the U.S. government persists in the position that
more research is needed to determine the scientific efficacy of
marijuana. However, no administration has yet been willing to
fund and authorize the necessary research. Herein lies the irony:
Government officials know the law prohibiting the medical use
of marijuana is questionable, but are unwilling to risk the
political heat of continuing research.
The impasse over the medical use of marijuana was finally
broken by the initiative process in California and Arizona in
1996, as both states approved measures to legalize the sale of
marijuana for medical purposes. As of 1997, six other states
also had medical marijuana laws, and such laws were pending
in five more, plus Washington, D.C. Conflicts between state
and federal law complicate implementation.

4For example, an amazingly high percentage (some say a third) of young African-
American men are in the criminal justice system, as a direct result of the arguably failing
“Drug War.” To me, this situation is a national sin that God will be a long time in forgiving.
What happens when the police and the courts and the criminal justice system are
commanded by politicians to treat a large amount of fairly harmless illegal drug use, and a
smaller amount of more serious addiction, in the same fashion as robbery and murder? Some
would say that we then see in the criminal justice system the growth of cynicism, lack of
respect for proper procedures, blaming the victims, burn-out, loss of professionalism and
civility, disregard of human rights, and other vices and abuses, including corruption.
Moreover, many people argue that the zero-tolerance/lock-em-up approach of our current
criminal-justice approach to drug policy itself creates other crimes. In fact, one could see
the criminal-justice zero-tolerance approach to drugs as not just an ineffective medicine, but
as a medicine that causes more of the very disease that the medicine is supposed to treat --
social harm and damage. Seen this way, the side effects of our current drug policy include
causing theft, mugging, and burglary -- as desperate, hooked people seek money for costly
illegal drugs. As illegal drug entrepreneurs protect their lucrative businesses, guns abound
and people are killed. Communities live in fear. Police and community leaders and
politicians are caught in a vicious cycle, trying to protect the community from the violence
that is caused by the failed drug policy itself. In large part because of the current “War on
Drugs,” the police and the criminal justice system are seen in many poor and minority
communities -- by many fully law-abiding and hard-working people -- as more a part of the
problem, than as a part of the solution.
Footnote: 5
5Our youth is our hope, and to saddle them with a legacy of despair based on
“marijuana use” defies reality.
With America's Number One Problem Drug [marijuana]
identified as the one teenagers are most likely to use, and every
sneer, slammed door, and blast of Joan Jett pegged as evidence
of a “drug problem,” the War on Drugs became a powerful
weapon for parents to use in their struggle with their teenagers.
Blaming drugs for kids' troubles also worked within the family
just as demonizing individuals' drug use worked in wider
society: it obviated concern for “root causes” and let parents
take their own behavior off the hook. If drugs were, as the
Florida pediatrician Ian Macdonald liked to assert, a problem
teenager's “only” problem, then parents needn't examine their
own role.
* * * * *
If anything is clear from the past 25 years of drug warfare, it is
that marijuana -- not crack, cocaine, or heroin -- is politically the
most important illegal drug. Precisely because it doesn't kill
people who use it, spawn gun battles in city streets, enrich
foreign drug lords, or inspire women to abandon their babies,
marijuana separates drug policy for public welfare from drug
policy for public relations. Without the marijuana ban, the
country's “drug problem” would be tiny. There wouldn't be 11
million regular users of illegal drugs in the United States, there
would be 2 million. Of those, about 350,000 use cocaine every
day. Along with the country's half million heroin addicts, these
hard-core users are our real “drug problem”: tragic, resistant to
solutions, but statistically minuscule.
Heroin and cocaine are the scary drugs that keep the Drug
War's home fires burning, but vastly more people are touched
personally by a war on marijuana that yields few benefits. Lives
aren't saved. Violent criminal organizations aren't disrupted.
Instead, a lot of harmless potheads -- and the generally peaceful
growers who supply them - go to prison at enormous expense to
the taxpayer. Diverting resources from that war to the treatment
of our small but desperate population of drug dependents would
be an act of medical logic and fiscal genius.

Brown & Company, 1997, pp. 155, 264-265, 331-332. Baum is a former Wall Street Journal
reporter.
Modern American drug and alcohol policy is a dry-drunk
crusade. The shrill anger at teenagers emanating from
Washington in the guise of “concern” is exactly the kind of
denial and scapegoating to be expected from an older generation
that has not confronted the dimensions of our own drug
tragedies. Yet for all the sound and fury in the Beltway, the
neighborhood reality is that adolescents seem to be forming their
own drug policy. The large majority of teenagers, for now and
for unknown reasons, are resisting both the addicted examples
of many of their elders and the histrionics of the official anti-
drug crusade.
Does marijuana kill? In the most recent year for which
detailed national vital statistics are available, 1990, 8,381 drug
overdose deaths are reported. Of these, three were attributed to
all hallucinogens (marijuana, hashish, LSD, mescaline,
psilocybin, peyote, etc.) put together. More dangerous by far
were salicylates (44 deaths), aromatic analgesics (65 deaths),
non-narcotic analgesics (aspirin, Tylenol, etc., 88 deaths), and
nearly all other drugs. These are much topped in the death
category, of course, by prescription drugs, heroin, cocaine,
methamphetamine, and amphetamine. Diuretic drugs were
implicated in 112 deaths, yet no drug officials called press
conferences to warn about “fighting for your life” in ER over
gout medicine.
* * * * *
But the low rate of teen marijuana smokers advancing to harder
drugs is not the only flaw in Califano's “steppingstone” or
“gateway” claim: There is scant evidence that use of one drug
causes use of another drug. Pot use, in and of itself, appears to
predict no future problem with the hard stuff, as Clinton, Gore,
and Clarence Thomas notably denote -- though it appears
directly related to a surfeit of middle-aged hypocrisy.

Summary
Antineoplastons (PDQ®)OverviewQuestions and Answers About AntineoplastonsCurrent Clinical TrialsChanges to This Summary (07/26/2011)General CAM InformationEvaluation of CAM ApproachesQuestions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMTo Learn More About CAMOverviewAntineoplastons are chemical compounds that are found normally in urine and blood. For use in medical research, antineoplastons can be made from chemicals in a laboratory. (See Question 1.)Antineoplaston therapy was developed by Dr. S. R. Burzynski, who proposed the use of antineoplastons as a possible cancer treatment in 1976. (See Question 2.)No randomized, controlled trials showing the effectiveness of antineoplastons have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. (See Question 6.)Nonrandomized clinical trials are ongoing at Dr. Burzynski’s clinic to study the effect of antineoplastons on cancer. (See Question 6.)Antineoplastons have caused mild side effects and some serious nervous system problems. (See Question 7.) Antineoplastons are not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention or treatment of any disease. (See Question 8.)Questions and Answers About Antineoplastons What are antineoplastons? Antineoplastons are a group of chemical compounds that are found normally in urine and blood. They are made up mostly of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) and peptides (compounds made of two or more amino acids). For use in medical research, antineoplastons were originally taken from human urine, but they are now made from chemicals in the laboratory. What is the history of the discovery and use of antineoplastons as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer? Antineoplaston therapy was developed by Dr. S. R. Burzynski. He proposed that there must be a process in the body that controls how a cell develops, and that this process fails when a cell divides endlessly and develops into a tumor. He suggested that certain natural substances, which he named ""antineoplastons,"" switch an abnormal cell back onto the path of normal development. Since peptides are considered to be the carriers of instructions in the body, he began looking for peptides that may be present in the blood of cancer patients. After comparing the blood of healthy people to the blood of people with cancer, Dr. Burzynski found that people with cancer have lower amounts of a certain group of chemicals. He found these same chemicals in urine and suggested that some of these chemicals can be used to stop certain cancer cells from dividing. Dr. Burzynski separated and removed several different types of antineoplastons from the urine of healthy people. He tested these antineoplastons on normal and abnormal cells to see their effect and found that some types of antineoplastons were more effective on more types of abnormal cells than others. He called this type antineoplaston A. He later developed and tested antineoplastons A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. He found that A2 had the most effect on tumor cells and named the active ingredient in it A10. Other antineoplastons followed. In 1976, Dr. Burzynski proposed the use of antineoplastons as a possible cancer treatment and began treating patients in clinical trials at his own clinic. (See Question 6.) Since 1980, Dr. Burzynski has made the antineoplastons from chemicals in his laboratory, instead of taking them from urine or blood. What is the theory behind the claim that antineoplastons are useful in treating cancer? According to Dr. Burzynski, when the body does not have enough antineoplastons, cells that begin to develop abnormally are not corrected, and tumors form and grow. He suggests that antineoplaston therapy supplies the body with the substances needed to correct the abnormal development of the cell and allow it to develop normally or to die a natural cell death, while healthy cells are not affected. How are antineoplastons administered? Antineoplastons have been given in different ways. Today, most antineoplastons are given by mouth or by injection (shot). Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using antineoplastons? Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a drug, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. These preclinical studies are done before testing in humans is begun. Dr. Burzynski did laboratory studies to see how antineoplastons affect human cancer cells. He reported that antineoplaston A killed human cancer cells but had no effect on animal tumor cells. Other types of antineoplastons have not been tested in animals. Japanese scientists tested some types of antineoplastons on human liver cancer cells. High doses were needed to slow the growth of the cells or cause them to die. Several laboratory-made antineoplastons have been tested on various types of cells and were reported to be more effective than the natural form taken from urine. (See the PDQ health professional summary on Antineoplastons for more information on preclinical study results.) Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of antineoplastons been conducted? To date, no phase III randomized, controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted. Many cancer patients have been treated with antineoplastons at Dr. Burzynski's clinic and studied there. A few trials and case studies have been done outside of the clinic. Some of the cancers studied include breast, bladder, cervical, prostate, liver, and lung cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors. Published information includes results from phase I clinical trials, phase II clinical trials, and case reports. The following antineoplastons were studied in clinical trials:Antineoplaston AAntineoplaston A10Antineoplaston AS2-1Antineoplaston AS2-5Antineoplaston A2Antineoplaston A3Antineoplaston A5Safety of AntineoplastonsPhase I trials are the first step in testing a new treatment in people. In these studies, researchers test to see what dose is safe, how the treatment should be given (such as by mouth or by injection), and how often it should be given. In the phase I trials of antineoplastons, side effects were usually mild and did not last long. The most severe harmful side effects occurred in a phase II trial. Phase II cancer trials study how a treatment works against certain types of cancer and how it affects the body. A phase II trial of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in brain tumor patients reported severe nervous system side effects including sleepiness, confusion, seizures, and swelling near the brain.(See Question 7.)Effect of Antineoplastons on Brain Tumors, Prostate Cancer, and Liver CancerStudies have reported on the effect of antineoplastons in certain types of cancer:The effect of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 on brain tumors was studied at Dr. Burzynski's clinic and at the Mayo Clinic. A brain tumor study done in Japan did not report the type of antineoplaston used. The effect of antineoplaston AS2-1 on prostate cancer was studied at Dr. Burzynski's clinic.The effect of antineoplaston A10 on liver cancer is discussed in a case report from Japan. These studies reported mixed results, including some cancer remissions (signs and symptoms of cancer decreased or went away). Other investigators have not been able to obtain the same results reported by Dr. Burzynski and his team. Some of the patients in the reported studies received standard treatments in addition to the antineoplastons. In those cases, it is not known if responses and side effects were caused by antineoplaston therapy, the other treatments, or both. One additional independent report (a study from Japan) was completed but does not have the same findings as the Burzynski report.(See the PDQ health professional summary on Antineoplastons for detailed information on clinical trial results.)Randomized controlled trials give the highest level of evidence. In these trials, volunteers are put randomly (by chance) into one of 2 or more groups that compare different treatments. One group (called the control group) does not receive the new treatment being studied. The control group is compared to the groups that receive the new treatment, to see if the new treatment works. No randomized, controlled trials showing the effectiveness of antineoplastons have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In 1991, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed some of Dr. Burzynski’s cases and decided to conduct clinical trials on antineoplastons at cancer centers. By August 1995, only 9 patients had enrolled and the clinical trials were closed before being completed. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Dr. Burzynski permission to conduct clinical trials of antineoplaston therapy at his own clinic. Ongoing non-randomized clinical trials at the Burzynski clinic continue to study the effect of antineoplastons on cancer. The antineoplastons now used in clinical trials are A10, AS2-5, AS2-1, A2, A3, and A5. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. Have any side effects or risks been reported from antineoplastons? Antineoplaston side effects included mild, short-term side effects as well as serious nervous system problems. The following mild side effects have been noted: Anemia (lower than normal number of red blood cells). High blood pressure. Dizziness. Gas. Fever and chills.Feeling very tired. Headaches. Abnormal levels of calcium in the blood. Dry or itchy skin rash.Nausea and vomiting. Numbness. Irregular heartbeat. Swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissues.Swelling, pain, or stiffness in small joints. Serious nervous system side effects included the following: Extreme sleepiness. Confusion. Seizures.Swelling near the brain. Are antineoplastons approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? Antineoplastons are not approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of any disease. In the United States, antineoplaston therapy can be obtained only in clinical trials at Dr. Burzynski’s clinic. Current Clinical TrialsCheck NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials for cancer CAM clinical trials on antineoplastons therapy that are actively enrolling patients. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.Changes to This Summary (07/26/2011)The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Editorial changes were made to this summary. General CAM InformationComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM ApproachesIt is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMWhen considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected?What are the risks associated with this therapy?Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?What benefits can be expected from this therapy?Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?If so, who is sponsoring the trial?Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?To Learn More About CAMNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public.NCCAM ClearinghousePost Office Box 7923 Gaithersburg, MD 20898–7923Telephone: 1–888–644–6226 (toll free) 301–519–3153 (for International callers)TTY (for deaf and hard of hearing callers): 1–866–464–3615Fax: 1–866–464–3616E-mail: info@nccam.nih.gov Web site: http://nccam.nih.gov CAM on PubMedNCCAM and the NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) jointly developed CAM on PubMed, a free and easy-to-use search tool for finding CAM-related journal citations.

Summary
PC-SPES (PDQ®)OverviewQuestions and Answers About PC-SPESChanges to This Summary (08/08/2011)General CAM InformationEvaluation of CAM ApproachesQuestions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMTo Learn More About CAMOverviewPC-SPES is a mixture of 8 herbs that was sold as a dietary supplement to keep the prostate healthy (see Question 1). Some batches of PC-SPES were found to contain prescription medicines. It was taken off the market and is no longer being made (see Question 1). Herbs in PC-SPES have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many health problems, including prostate problems, for hundreds of years (see Question 2).The herbs used in PC-SPES have been reported to help keep cancer cells from growing or help prevent cell damage that can lead to cancer (see Question 3).Laboratory and animal studies suggested that PC-SPES might slow the growth of prostate cancer cells, but it is not known if these results were caused by the herbs in PC-SPES, prescription medicines that were found in the mixture, or both (see Question 5). Clinical trials suggested that PC-SPES lowers PSA (prostate specific antigen) and testosterone levels in humans and has some anticancer effects. It is not known if these results were caused by the herbs in PC-SPES, prescription medicines that were found in the mixture, or both (see Question 6).The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved PC-SPES for use in cancer treatment (see Question 8).Questions and Answers About PC-SPESWhat is PC-SPES? PC-SPES is a mixture of herbs that was sold as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment for people with prostate cancer. The mixture contains these 8 herbs: Baikal skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis)Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra or Glycyrrhiza uralensis)Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) Isatis (Isatis indigotica)Ginseng (Panax ginseng or Panax pseudoginseng var. notoginseng)Chrysanthemum flowers (Dendranthema morifolium)Rabdosia rubescens (Isodon rubescens)Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) PC-SPES was taken off the market because some batches were found to contain prescription medicines in addition to the herbs. Clinical trials of PC-SPES that were underway were stopped. There are products being sold now as substitutes for PC-SPES, but they are not the same mixture.What is the history of the discovery and use of PC-SPES as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer? Most of the herbs in PC-SPES have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for many health problems, including prostate problems, for hundreds of years. A chemist in New York and a doctor/herbalist in China worked together to create the mixture. In 1997, a company was formed to make PC-SPES and sell it in the United States without a prescription. Interest in PC-SPES grew, and researchers began looking at it. Tests found that some batches of PC-SPES contained one or more of the following drugs, which are not found in nature:DES, a type of estrogen made in a lab.Warfarin (Coumadin), a blood-thinner. Indomethacin, a drug used to decrease inflammation. Because these drugs are to be used only by prescription and could be harmful to some people, PC-SPES was taken off the market in 2002. The company that made PC-SPES has closed.What is the theory behind the claim that PC-SPES is useful in treating cancer?In lab tests, each herb used in PC-SPES has been reported to help keep cancer cells from growing or to help prevent cell damage that can lead to cancer and other diseases.PC-SPES was reported to slow the growth of prostate cancer but did not cure it. It is not known how PC-SPES works in the body. Some of the herbs in the mixture contain phytoestrogens, which are estrogen-like substances found in plants. Estrogen can cause the testicles to stop making testosterone, which makes some prostate cancers grow. Patients' responses to PC-SPES were similar to responses to estrogen therapy using DES. The DES found in some batches of PC-SPES, however, may not have been enough to cause all of the estrogen-like effects that were seen in users of the mixture. There is some evidence that the mixture works in a different way than DES does, and that PC-SPES alone (without DES in it) may fight prostate cancer.PC-SPES has also shown anticancer effects on prostate cancers that do not depend on testosterone and on other types of cancer. This suggests that PC-SPES may have anticancer qualities other than its estrogen-like effects. How is PC-SPES administered?PC-SPES is taken by mouth in capsules.Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using PC-SPES? Studies of PC-SPES in test tubes and using rats showed that it might keep cancer cells from growing. These studies were done, however, before it became known that some batches of the product contained unlisted prescription medicines. Also, the product was not standardized (different batches of PC-SPES were found to contain different strengths of the herbal ingredients). For these reasons, the results of the lab tests and animal studies are not considered to be good evidence. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is doing three laboratory studies using existing PC-SPES supplies. The studies are being done to see how the herbs in PC-SPES might act in the body.Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of PC-SPES been conducted?Clinical trials of PC-SPES had begun before the product was taken off the market. In these trials, PC-SPES was reported to improve quality of life, reduce pain, and lower PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels in patients with prostate cancer. Rising PSA levels can be a sign that prostate cancer is growing. After it was learned that some batches of PC-SPES contained prescription medicines, ongoing studies were stopped and previous study results came into question. The responses reported in the studies may have been caused by the prescription medicines that were in the PC-SPES, as well as by the herbal ingredients. Also, since different batches of PC-SPES contained different ingredients, the studies cannot easily be compared. Have any side effects or risks been reported from PC-SPES?Common side effects were the same as those reported with estrogen therapy:Breast swelling and tenderness.Loss of sex drive.Impotence (inability to have an erection).There were other, less common, side effects:Blood clots in the legs.Diarrhea.PC-SPES may also change the way drugs, including anticancer drugs, work in the body. It may cause drugs to be more or less effective, or cause effects on the body that are not expected.Is PC-SPES approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved PC-SPES for use in cancer treatment. It is not legally sold in the United States.Changes to This Summary (08/08/2011)The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.

A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM ApproachesIt is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMWhen considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected?What are the risks associated with this therapy?Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?What benefits can be expected from this therapy?Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?If so, who is sponsoring the trial?Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?To Learn More About CAMNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public.NCCAM ClearinghousePost Office Box 7923 Gaithersburg, MD 20898–7923Telephone: 1–888–644–6226 (toll free) 301–519–3153 (for International callers)TTY (for deaf and hard of hearing callers): 1–866–464–3615Fax: 1–866–464–3616E-mail: info@nccam.nih.gov Web site: http://nccam.nih.gov CAM on PubMedNCCAM and the NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) jointly developed CAM on PubMed, a free and easy-to-use search tool for finding CAM-related journal citations.

Cancer - The New Approach
by Phillip Day
In spite of the medical establishment's dictatorial
attitude towards protecting their cancer income, huge inroads into conquering
cancer were made at the turn of the 1900s by Professor John Beard of Edinburgh
University. Beard was no exception in that he received harassment for
what he subsequently found. But like many pioneers, he soldiered on nonetheless.
John Beard can justifiably be praised for being the individual who broke
the back of cancer's mystery and brought its demise forward by many decades.
Beard was an embryologist who was one of the first
doctors to study embryonic stem cells, these enigmatic pre-embryonic cells
that reside within our body. Beard had noticed that these cells had the
ability to develop into the cell structure of any body part, and even
into a new embryo, if given the right morphogenetic, hormonal stimulus.
He discovered that in pregnancy, the body uses the
hormone estrogen to stimulate these stem cells into rapidly multiplying
into a cell mass Beard called 'trophoblast', releasing quantities of human
chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), the hormone later to be detected with a
pregnancy test. Beard's thesis stated that these trophoblastic cells have
a job to do in pregnancy, namely to etch away part of the uterus wall
so that the embryo can attach itself and start to develop. Once this has
been achieved, the trophoblastic cells are destroyed around the 56th day
of pregnancy when the baby's pancreas comes online and emits its enzymes,
which deconstruct the outer coating of the trophoblast, allowing the immune
system to clear away the remainder of these cells. Beard had discovered
that in the event that the baby's pancreas fails, both the mother and
the child die of cancer. In fact, what they die from is an uncontrolled
and unregulated proliferation of these trophoblast cells, which now have
no pancreatic enzyme 'termination' agents to curtail them.
CANCER AS A ROGUE HEALING
PROCESS
Beard found that these stem cells also exist in our body for healing.
When we hurt ourselves, our bodies initiate an automatic healing process
(survival response) - we know this, and have seen it happen a thousand
times. But intriguingly, the healing process commences the same way as
with pregnancy trophoblast, namely, the hormone estrogen stimulates our
stem cells into producing a trophoblastic 'carpet' of cells which seals
off the damaged area and repairs it with cells formed into the cell structure
of the bodypart that is being fixed. This healing process is then terminated
by pancreatic enzymes upon completion of the task. In the event that we
have low levels of these vital pancreatic enzymes, there is no termination
agent for the trophoblast in our body and the trophoblast therefore continues
to multiply and proliferate unopposed. The result is an ever expanding
mass of trophoblastic cells in our body at the site specific to the original
area of damage. Today we call this cell mass a tumour.
Beard discovered that our bodies become depleted of
these vital pancreatic enzymes when we eat a diet rich in animal proteins.
Without this protection, we become prone to developing cancer if the healing
processes that initiate in our bodies are not terminated upon completion
of their task. Beard began treating cancer patients to great effect using
pancreatic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin, as well as other vital nutrients,
up until his death around the beginning of World War 1. His theory, as
expounded in his papers, was that, by introducing pancreatic enzymes into
a cancer patient's body, the enzymes would continue with their job of
digesting the outer protein coating of the trophoblast cells, allowing
the body to clear away any dangerous trophoblastic proliferation.
We must remember that after Beard's career, medicine
began treating cancer patients with Marie Curie's radium and other desperate
remedies, causing further trauma, and no doubt generating more trophoblast
as a survival response to counter the hurt being done to the body. Beard's
work was largely ignored until Ernst T Krebs Jr, a biochemist from Nevada,
came across Beard's thesis during his work with enzymes and nutrition.
Krebs was studying those cultures on Earth who did
not suffer from cancer. He was aware that men like Albert Schweitzer and
explorer Roald Amundsen were coming back from remote areas of the globe
reporting that cancer just didn't exist among the populations they had
encountered. To the Labrador Eskimos, the Thlinglets, the tribes of Gabon,
the Vilcabambans of Ecuador, the Georgian tribes of southern Russia, the
Karakorum and Hunzas of eastern Pakistan and the Hopi Indians of Arizona,
cancer was unknown - and Krebs was keen to find out why.
He discovered that these peoples differed from westernised
populations because they were doing one or all of the following which
Krebs believed resulted in their pronounced and healthy longevity:
They lived in environments devoid of man-made toxins.
They ate diets rich in minerals and raw whole foods.
They ate the dietary compound hydrocyanic acid,
a staple of the nitriloside food group, which had been largely eliminated
from the diets of Western populations.
Krebs' work on hydrocyanic acid was especially controversial,
even as it still is today. The biochemist found that this compound was
contained within the apricot seeds of the Hunzas - indeed within all the
seeds of the common fruits, excluding citrus, as well as other foods that
had largely been cut out of Western diets. The Hunzas were cracking open
their apricot pits and consuming the soft seed within along with the pulp
of the fruit. In addition, their womenfolk pressed the oil out of the
kernels they collected and used it for cooking and cosmetics.
Krebs analysed hydrocyanic acid to discover its life-preserving
qualities and reported that when this compound came into contact with
trophoblast cells, it selectively killed them by manufacturing two poisons
in minute quantities - hydrogen cyanide and benzaldehyde. Krebs also discovered
that this reaction did not occur with healthy cells, thus preserving and
even nourishing healthy tissue. Research demonstrated that the hydrocyanic
acid compound could only be 'unlocked' by beta-glucosidase, a cellular
enzyme which, although present throughout the body in minute quantities,
was located in huge amounts at the site of trophoblast tumours. The beta-glucosidase
contained in the trophoblast cells appeared to 'unlock' the hydrocyanic
acid contained in the food to produce hydrogen cyanide and benzaldehyde
at the cancer site. The two poisons combined synergistically to produce
a super-poison many times more deadly than either substance in isolation.
Thus the cancer cell met its chemical death at the hands of this unique
compound's selective toxicity.
Krebs ran toxicity studies to determine whether hydrocyanic
acid, or Laetrile/amygdalin/Vitamin B17, as the active principal would
later become known, was dangerous to the organism if ingested in abnormal
quantities. He reported that Vitamin B17 was harmless and chemically inert
until stimulated by the beta-glucosidase available within cancer cells.
Later other researchers would replicate Krebs' work
to confirm these findings. Sheep fed the equivalent of 8-10mg of HCN (hydrogen
cyanide) per kilogram per day as linseed meal showed no toxic effects
whatsoever. Sheep weighing 66kg were intravenously administered a three-hour
dose of 2.7 gms of B17 yielding 300mg of HCN. New Zealand researchers
Coop and Blakely reported that ""...at no time during the experiment
were even the slightest symptoms observed."" A total of 568mg
of HCN was given to a 76kg sheep in the course of an hour. The only symptom
the animal showed was ""a general sleepiness for an hour"".
Van der Walt failed to produce chronic poisoning in sheep even after administering
3.2mg HCN/kg daily for two years. Worden showed that repeated dosing in
rabbits does not produce a cumulative effect and the animal was capable
of eliminating excess B17 within two and a half hours.
Other researchers, such as Dr Harold Manner, head of
biology at Loyola University, Chicago, ever mindful of the extreme flak
Krebs began receiving following the publication of his findings, put further
pieces of the cancer puzzle together. Manner began combining Beard's pancreatic
enzymes, trypsin and chymotrypsin, with Vitamin A emulsion and B17-Laetrile,
and used this protocol with a radical change of diet supplemented with
minerals and antioxidants such as Vitamin C and selenium to supercharge
the cancer patient to halt the progression of rogue trophoblast and even
eliminate it altogether. This procedure was later to form the basis of
the nutritional Metabolic Therapy we see practised in the most successful
cancer clinics today.
The public and press began showing a marked interest
in this controversial research, especially in view of the fact that this
new approach to cancer treatment did not involve the use of toxic or radical
treatments that were now increasingly becoming viewed as largely useless
and 'ethically questionable':
When President Richard Nixon was deluged with tens of thousands of petitions
from ordinary citizens everywhere demanding clinical trials for Laetrile,
these demands were forwarded to his cancer advisor, Benno Schmidt... When
Schmidt consulted all of his medical colleagues about Laetrile, he found
them vehemently opposed to it. But, interestingly enough, as he told reporters
later: ""I couldn't get anybody to show me scientific proof that
the stuff didn't work.""
In 1973 a three-month trial at the Southern Research
Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, intensively researched the therapeutic
properties of Laetrile. The institute finally released its findings to
the National Cancer Institute which proceeded to announce to the public
that once again studies proved that B17-Laetrile had no effect whatsoever
in the treatment of cancer. However not all was as it appeared. When the
data and protocols from these experiments were subsequently studied in
more detail by Dr Dean Burk, one of the National Cancer Institute's founders
and head of its Department of Cytochemistry, inconsistencies in the trial
protocols began to appear. Researcher G Edward Griffin, whose controversial
book World Without Cancer broke the Laetrile story to the public in the
1970s, explains:
""Every [Laetrile] study had been tarnished
with the same kind of scientific ineptitude, bias, and outright deception
as found in the 1953 MacDonald/Garland California report. Some of these
studies openly admitted evidence of anti-cancer effect but hastened to
attribute this effect to other causes. Some were toxicity studies only,
which means that they weren't trying to see if Laetrile was effective,
but merely to determine how much of it was required to kill the patient.""
Despite announcing to the world that Laetrile was useless,
the National Cancer Institute, the American Medical Association and the
drug cartels looked on with anger as a national grass-roots movement sprang
up across America as a result of the many cancer recoveries being reported
and attributed to Laetrile and supporting nutrition. It was the '70s and
people were distrustful of their government as a result of Watergate and
Vietnam. The Committee for Freedom-of-Choice in Cancer Therapy was formed,
founding several hundred chapters across America which in turn held public
meetings, press conferences and pressured state legislative committees
into calling for the 'legalisation' of Vitamin B17.
The federal government eventually persuaded the cancer
industry to test Laetrile, which they did - without the pancreatic enzymes
and other supporting co-factors required to break down the cancer cell.
Of course the trials failed and the results - or lack of them - were subsequently
reported, the summary declaring that Laetrile has no anti-cancer benefit
whatsoever. Meanwhile, other cancer industry-appointed scientists, such
as Dr Kanematsu Sugiura, Dr Elizabeth Stockert and Dr Lloyd Schoen, were
using the correct protocols at Memorial Sloan-Kettering and achieving
startling results, as others would around the world in the years to come.
But even these results were mis-reported, and once
again B17 was 'tossed under the bus' with Memorial Sloan-Kettering's incredible
conclusion: ""These results allow no definite conclusion supporting
the anti-cancer activity of Laetrile.""
This did not stop many physicians across America and
later the world from implementing this therapy into their treatments of
cancer patients. Many of these professionals received constant harassment
at the hand of the medical authorities, who accused them of practising
quackery and treating their patients with an 'unappoved drug' which contained
the dangerous 'cyanide'. Gradually, through persistent and at times downright
paranoid propaganda, the little yellow apricot became a natural-born killer
in the eyes of many. Interestingly, the establishment proved dismal in
the consistency of its opposition, focusing on ""cyanide - what
are you crazy?!"" but failing to pillory Vitamin B12 as a 'deadly
agent', containing as it does the cyanide radical also (Vitamin B12 is
known as cyanocobalamin).
Philip Binzel MD, a doctor who retrained to treat his
cancer patients with this nutritional therapy, foregoing the dangers of
toxic chemotherapy and radiation treatments, highlights in his book Alive
and Well the problem many doctors were having with an inherent lack of
knowledge on nutrition:
""Most of my first patients were those who had
all of the surgery, radiation and chemotherapy they could tolerate and
their tumors were still growing. I did for these patients the best I knew
to do. My biggest problem at the time was understanding nutrition.
In four years of medical school, one year of Family Practice residency,
I had not had even one lecture on nutrition."" [emphasis mine]
Binzel's book catalogues the repeated harassment he
received at the hands of the Ohio State Medical Board and the Food &
Drug Administration over his use of Laetrile and nutritional co-factors
for his cancer patients. Binzel's incredible story of amazing tumour regressions
and eliminations amid the backdrop of draconian treatment at the hands
of his peers is typical of the rollercoaster ride many courageous doctors
underwent in order to bring the truth of wellness to their suffering patients.
Even the Food & Drug Administration had its defectors.
June de Spain, one of its pharmacologists and toxicologists, wrote The
Little Cyanide Cookbook, in which she dispels the 'deadly-cyanide-in-its-natural-form'
myth and lays out hundreds of diets containing the essential nitriloside
factor. De Spain sums up her own findings on the back cover of her book:
""Because of its unique molecular structure,
this compound releases cyanide only at the cancer site, thus destroying
cancer cells while nourishing non-cancer tissue. Those populations in
the world which eat these vitamin-rich foods simply do not get cancer
- and they live to be much older than those who subsist on the typical
modern diet.
Cyanide in minute quantities and in the proper food
forms, instead of being poisonous, actually is an essential component
of normal body chemistry. Vitamin B12, for instance, contains cyanide
in the form of cyanocobalamin.""
Other doctors around the world were doing their own
research, such as Dr Hans Nieper, former Director of the Department of
Medicine at Silbersee Hospital in Hanover, Germany: During a visit to
the United States in 1972, Dr Nieper told reporters: ""After more
than twenty years of such specialised work, I have found non-toxic nitrilosides
- that is, Laetrile - far superior to any other known cancer treatment
or preventative. In my opinion, it is the only existing possibility for
the ultimate control of cancer.""
In Canada, Dr N R Bouziane, former Director of Research
Laboratories at St Jeanne D'Arc Hospital in Montreal, published his repeated
successes in treating cancers with nutrition, which were written up in
the medical literature, including the Cancer News Journal, Jan/April 1971,
p.20, under the article heading ""The Laetrile Story"".
In the Philippines, Dr Manuel Navarro, former Professor
of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Santo Tomas, Manila, and
an internationally recognised cancer researcher with over 100 major scientific
papers to his credit, treated terminally ill cancer patients with Laetrile
for over 25 years. He stated in the Cancer News Journal: ""It is
my carefully considered clinical judgement, as a practising oncologist
and researcher in this field, that I have obtained most significant and
encouraging results with the use of Laetrile-amygdalin in the treatment
of terminal cancer patients...""
In Mexico, Dr Ernesto Contreras, one of the country's
leading medical specialists in nutritional treatment for cancer for over
30 years, remarks of B17-Laetrile's action with extreme terminal cancer
cases: ""The palliative action [the ability of a substance to improve
the comfort of a patient] is in about 60% of the cases. Frequently, enough
to be significant, I see arrest of the disease or even regression in some
15% of the very advanced cases.""
Ernesto's son Francisco Contreras continues the work
today after his father's retirement. Francisco is author of The Hope of
Living Cancer Free in which he lays out the protocols his clinic has used
to marvellous success in treating thousands of patients since 1963.
In Italy, Professor Etore Guidetti, of the University
of Turin Medical School, announced startling results with Laetrile in
successfully combating many types of cancer, including cervix, breast,
uterus and rectum. After a speech, an American doctor rose in the audience,
challenging the Italian professor that Laetrile had been found to be worthless
in the United States. Dr Guidetti was abrupt and dismissive: ""I
care not what was determined in the United States. I am merely reporting
what I saw in my own clinic.""

Laetrile
This treatment modality is used in place of conventional therapies to treat cancer. Seek advice from a qualified physician before replacing standard cancer therapy with Laetrile therapy.
What does Laetrile therapy involve?
Laetrile, also known as amygdalin, Vitamin B17, sarcarcinase and nitriloside, is a natural substance found in the pits of some fruits and nuts. Laetrile is a compound that can release cyanide, a lethal molecule. Treatment with Laetrile is commonly administered intravenously for two to three weeks. The treatment is followed up by oral maintenance doses.
How is Laetrile thought to treat cancer?
There are two theories by which Laetrile is claimed to work:
1. Cyanide Release Theory
Beta-glucosidase, an enzyme which is thought to exist in large quantities in cancerous tissue, causes the release of hydrogen cyanide from Laetrile. Cyanide stops tumor respiration and selectively kills the cancerous tissue.
2. Vitamin Deficiency Theory
Cancer is the result of a vitamin deficiency and Laetrile is the missing “vitamin B17.”
What has been proven about the benefit of Laetrile?
Scientific studies have been conducted for over twenty years and no evidence of any antitumor activity, in either animals or humans, has been found. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved laetrile as a treatment for cancer, although the drug is manufactured and distributed as a cancer treatment in Mexico.
What is the potential risk or harm of Laetrile?
While taking Laetrile, patients may experience nausea, vomiting, headache and dizziness. There are several reports in the medical literature in which Laetrile caused life-threatening toxicity and even death. Cyanide toxicity can cause progressive neuromuscular weakness and respiratory arrest.
How much does laetrile cost?
Laetrile is usually given as part of a larger treatment program and can cost between $2,000 and $5,000 per week.

Scientific
Facts Behind Laetrile
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To base the whole argument of whether Laetrile works or
not on laboratory experiments and their results is ludicrous.
Humans conduct these experiments and humans lie. Since
cancer research and treatments run into the billions of
dollars, the government agencies along with the major cancer
research centers will always hide the truth.
To be able to cure cancer with something so ""trivial
and inexpensive"" a treatment is tantamount to all Laetrile
research by cancer research centers being sabotaged.
""For the love of money is the root of all evil�""
1 Tim 6:10 KJV
""The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked: who can know it?""
Jer 17:9 KJV
However, there are a few honest researchers with integrity
who have not played the political cancer game. Money is
not what motivates these people but the search for truth
does. Here are their names with a brief synopsis of their
experiments with Laetrile:
Dr. Ernest T. Krebs, Jr. a biochemist and the researcher
who first isolated Laetrile in apricot seeds and also discovered
B-15 (pangamic acid, a vitamin which has been proven to
be an important adjunctive therapy in the treatment of illnesses
related to circulation).
He spent three years of anatomy and medicine at Hahnemann
Medical College and then changed his direction and became
a doctor of biochemistry. He did undergraduate work at the
University of Illinois between 1938-41. He did graduate
work at the University of Mississippi and also at the University
of California.
By 1950, he had isolated the nutritional factor in crystalline
form and named it Laetrile. He tested it on animals to make
sure that it was not toxic. He then had to prove that it
was not toxic to humans. There was only one thing to do.
He rolled up his sleeve and injected Laetrile into his
own arm. As he predicted, there were no harmful or distressing
side effects.
(I find it interesting to note that Dr. Krebs was more
than willing to test his theory about Laetrile on himself
while cancer doctors and their personnel take great precautions
to be sure they themselves are not exposed to the drugs
they administer to their cancer victims, I mean patients.)
Dr. Krebs authored many scientific papers in his lifetime.
He was the recipient of numerous honors and doctorates both
at home and abroad. He was the science director of the John
Beard Memorial Foundation before his death in 1996.
Dr. Dean Burk, Director of the Cytochemistry Section of
the federal government's National Cancer Institute reported
that, in a series of tests on animal tissue, the (Laetrile)
vitamin B-17 had no harmful effect on normal cells but was
deadly to a cancer cell.
In another series of tests, Dr. Burk reported that Laetrile
was responsible for prolonging the life of cancerous rats
eighty percent longer than those in the control group that
were not inoculated.
Dr. Burk was one of the foremost cancer specialists in
the world. He was the recipient of the Gerhard Domagk Award
for Cancer Research, the Hillebrand Award of the American
Chemical Society, and the Commander Knighthood Of the Medical
Order of Bethlehem (Rome) founded in 1459 by Pope Pius the
Eleventh. He held a Ph.D. in biochemistry earned at the
University of California.
He was a Fellow of the National Research Council at the
University of London, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
Biology, and also Harvard. He was senior chemist at the
National Cancer Institute, which he helped establish, and
in 1946 became Director of the Cytochemistry Section.
He belonged to eleven scientific organizations, wrote three
books relating to chemotherapy research in cancer, and was
author or co-author of more than two-hundred scientific
papers in the field of cell chemistry. He is a biochemist.
If Dr. Burk says that Laetrile works, I believe him!
Let us look at one more study. For five years, between
1972 and 1977, Laetrile was meticulously tested at Sloan-Kettering
under the direction of Dr. Kanematsu Sugiura.
Dr. Sugiura was the senior laboratory researcher at Sloan-Kettering
with over 60 years experience. He had earned the highest
respect for his knowledge and integrity. He was the perfect
person to conduct experiments since his quest for truth
blocked out anything else. Dr. C. Chester Stock, the man
in charge of Sloan-Kettering's laboratory-testing division
wrote this about Dr. Sigiura, ""Few, if any, names in
cancer research are as widely known as Kanematsu Sugiura's�
Possibly the high regard in which his work is held is best
characterized by a comment made to me by a visiting investigator
in cancer research from Russia. He said, ""When Dr.
Sugiura publishes, we know we don't have to repeat the study,
for we would obtain the same results he has reported.""""
(Ralph Moss, The Cancer Syndrome, New York: Grove Press,
1980 pg. 258)
The official report about Laetrile from Dr. Sigiura read:
""The results clearly show that Amygdalin significantly
inhibits the appearance of lung metastasis in mice bearing
spontaneous mammary tumors and increases significantly the
inhibition of the growth of the primary tumors� Laetrile
also seemed to prevent slightly the appearance of new tumors�
The improvement of health and appearance of the treated
animals in comparison to controls is always a common observation�
Dr. Sugiura has never observed complete regression of these
tumors in all his cosmic experience with other chemotherapeautic
agents."" (""A Summary of the Effect of Amygdalin
Upon Spontaneous Mammary Tumors in Mice,"" Sloan-Kettering
report, June 13, 1973.)
Dr. Sugiura's report was cause for great alarm at Sloan-Kettering.
Remember, cancer is over a billion dollars a year industry.
This report would cause the house of cards to collapse.
As would be expected then, many more experiments were conducted
by others who were not as honest as Dr. Sugiura.
At a press conference, Dr. Sugiura was asked suddenly by
a reporter if he stuck to his report. Dr. Sugiura clearly
and boldly stated, ""I stick,"" even though Sloan-Kettering
was trying to discredit everything that he did. To read
about the many times that Sloan-Kettering tried to discredit
their finest researcher, get the book, ""World Without
Cancer,"" by G. Edward Griffin.
Now, even though we have proof from the laboratories, let
us look at what is being discovered in prominent physicians'
studies:
(The following is taken from the book, ""World Without
Cancer"", by G. Edward Griffin, published by American
Media, Westlake Village, CA)
""As early as 1974, there was at least twenty-six published
papers written by well-known physicians who had used Laetrile
in the treatment of their own patients and who have concluded
that Laetrile is both safe and effective in the treatment
of cancer.
Dr. Hans Nieper, of West Germany, former Director of the
Department of Medicine at the Silbersee Hospital in Hanover.
He is a pioneer in the medical use of cobalt and is credited
with developing the anti-cancer drug, cyclophosphamide.
He is the originator of the concept of ""electrolyte
carriers"" in the prevention of cardiac necrosis. He
was formerly the head of the Aschaffenburg Hospital Laboratory
for chemical circulatory research. He is listed in Who's
Who in World Science and has been the Director of the German
Society for Medical Tumor Treatment.
He is one of the world's most famous and respected cancer
specialists. During a visit to the U.S. in 1972, Dr. Nieper
told news reporters, ""After more than twenty years
of such specialized work, I have found the nontoxic Nitrilosides-that
is Laetrile-far superior to any other known cancer treatment
or preventative. In my opinion, it is the only existing
possibility for the ultimate control of cancer.""
In Canada there is N.R. Bouziane, M.D., former Director
of Research Laboratories at St. Jeanne d'Arc Hospital in
Montreal and a member of the hospital's tumor board in charge
of chemotherapy. He graduated magna cum laude in medicine
from the University of Montreal.
He also received a doctorate in science from the University
of Montreal and St. Joseph's University, an affiliate of
Oxford University in New Brunswick. He was a Fellow in chemistry
and a Fellow in hematology, and certified in clinical bacteriology,
hematology and biochemistry from the college. He also was
Dean of the American Association of Bio?Analysts. After
the first series of tests with Laetrile shortly after it
was introduced, Dr. Bouziane reported:
We always have a diagnosis based on histology [microscopic
analysis of the tissue]. We have never undertaken a case
without histological proof of cancer...
In our investigation, some terminal cases were so hopeless
that they did not even receive what we consider the basic
dose of thirty grams. Most cases, however, became ambulatory
and some have in this short time resumed their normal activities
on a maintenance dose. (Cancer News Journal, Jan./Apr. 1971,
pg. 20)
In the Philippines there is Manuel Navarro, M.D., former
Professor of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Santo
Tomas in Manila; an Associate Member of the National Research
Council of the Philippines; a Fellow of the Philippine College
of Physicians, the Philippine Society of Endocrinology and
Metabolism; and a member of the Philippine Medical Association,
the Philippine Cancer Society, and many other medical groups.
He has been recognized internationally as a cancer researcher
and has over one?hundred major scientific papers to his
credit, some of which have been read before the International
Cancer Congress. In 1971 Dr. Navarro wrote:
I ... have specialized in oncology [the study of tumors]
for the past eighteen years. For the same number of years
I have been using Laetrile?amygdalin in the treatment of
my cancer patients.
During this eighteen year period I have treated a total
of over five hundred patients with Laetrile?amygdalin by
various routes of administration, including the oral and
the I.V. The majority of my patients receiving Laetrile?amygdalin
have been in a terminal state when treatment with this material
commenced.
It is my carefully considered clinical judgment, as a
practicing oncologist and researcher in this field, that
I have obtained most significant and encouraging results
with the use of Laetrile?amygdalin in the treatment of terminal
cancer patients, and that these results are comparable or
superior to the results I have obtained with the use of
the more toxic standard cytotoxic agents. (Letter from Dr.
Navarro to Mr. Andrew McNaughton, The McNaughton Foundation,
dated January 8, 1971, published in the Cancer News Journal,
Jan./April, 1971, pp. 19,20.)
In Mexico there is Ernesto Contreras, M.D., who, for over
three decades, has operated the Good Samaritan Cancer Clinic
(now called the Oasis Hospital) in Tijuana. He is one of
Mexico's most distinguished medical figures. He received
postgraduate training at Harvard's Children's Hospital in
Boston. He has served as Professor of Histology and Pathology
at the Mexican Army Medical School and as the chief pathologist
at the Army Hospital in Mexico City
Dr. Contreras was introduced to Laetrile in 1963 by a terminal
cancer patient from the United States who brought it to
his attention and urged him to treat her with it. The woman
recovered, and Dr. Contreras began extensive investigation
of its properties and use. Since that time he has treated
many thousands of cancer patients, most of whom are American
citizens who have been denied the freedom to use Laetrile
in their own country.
Dr. Contreras has summarized his experiences with vitamin
therapy as follows:
The palliative action [improving the comfort and well?being
of the patient] is in about 60% of the cases. Frequently,
enough to be significant, I see arrest of the disease or
even regression in some of the very advanced cases. (Cancer
News Journal, Jan./April, 1971, pp. 20. We must bear in
mind that these are terminal patients-people who have been
given up as hopeless by orthodox medicine. Fifteen percent
recovery in that group is a most impressive accomplishment.)
In Japan there is Shigeaki Sakai, a prominent physician
in Tokyo. In a paper published in the October 1963 Asian
Medical journal, Dr. Sakai reported:
Administered to cancer patients, Laetrile has proven to
be quite free from any harmful side?effects, and I would
say that no anticancer drug could make a cancerous patient
improve faster than Laetrile. It goes without saying that
Laetrile controls cancer and is quite effective wherever
it is located.
In Italy there is Professor Etore Guidetti, M.D., of the
University of Turin Medical School. Dr. Guidetti spoke before
the Conference of the International Union Against Cancer
held in Brazil in 1954 and revealed how his use of Laetrile
in terminal cancer patients had caused the destruction of
a wide variety of tumors including those of the uterus,
cervix, rectum, and breast. ""In some cases,"" he
said, ""one has been able to observe a group of fulminating
and cauliflower?like neoplastic masses resolved very rapidly.""
He reported that, after giving Laetrile to patients with
lung cancer, he had been ""able to observe, with the
aid of radiography, a regression of the neoplasm or the
metastases.""
After Guidetti's presentation, an American doctor rose
in the audience and announced that Laetrile had been investigated
in the United States and found to be worthless.
Dr. Guidetti replied, ""I do not care what was determined
in the United States. I am merely reporting what I saw in
my own clinic."" (Cancer News Journal, Jan./April, 1971,
p. 19)
In Belgium there is Professor Joseph H. Maisin, Sr., M.D.,
of the University of Louvain where he was Director of the
Institute of Cancer. He also was President Emeritus of the
International League Against Cancer which conducts the International
Cancer Congress every four years.
And in the United States there are such respected names
as Dr. Dean Burk of the National Cancer Institute; Dr. John
A. Morrone of the Jersey City Medical Center; Dr. Ernst
T. Krebs, Jr., who developed Laetrile; Dr. John A. Richardson,
the courageous San Francisco physician who challenged the
government's right to prevent Laetrile from being used in
the United States (See John A. Richardson, M.D., and Patricia
Griffin, R.N., Laetrile Case Histories; The Richardson Cancer
Clinic Experience published by Westlake Village, CA: American
Media, 1977); Dr. Philip E. Binzel, Jr., a physician in
Washington Court House, Ohio, who has used Laetrile for
over twenty years with outstanding success (Philip E. Binzel,
M.D., Alive and Well: One Doctor's Experience with Nutrition
in the Treatment of Cancer Patients, published by American
Media, Westlake Village, CA, 1994); and many others from
over twenty countries with equally impeccable credentials.""
(End of quote from World Without Cancer, by G. Edward Griffin).
In my opinion, these results are more credible than something
that can be worked up in a laboratory. The proof of whether
Laetrile works or not is undisputed by eyewitness accounts
from these highly respected physicians who have had many
years of seeing people recover from their cancer by using
Laetrile therapy. Remember, laboratory experiments can be
manipulated to produce any result that the researcher is
looking for. Unscrupulous men have used these reports for
their own gain and benefit, not for the cancer patients.
Laetrile is a vitamin that cannot be patented. It is not
worthy to used in cancer treatment since it is not making
the conglomorate pharmaceutical companies, research centers,
etc. any money. To them, the only solution is drugs, even
though they know without any doubt that these drugs do not
work. To prove it, let's take a look at what surgery, radiation,
and chemotherapy really do to the cancer patient.
Surgery is the least harmful of the three. Surgery can
be life-saving if there are intestinal blockages that must
be relieved to prevent death of secondary complications.
There is also the psychological advantage of visually removing
the tumor and offering the temporary comfort of hope. However,
the degree to which surgery is useful is the same degree
to which the tumor is not malignant. The greater the proportion
of cancer cells in the tumor, the less likely that surgery
will help. The most malignant tumors are generally considered
inoperable. There are also two to consider that cutting
into the tumor, even for a biopsy, does. First, there is
trauma to the area. This triggers the healing process, which
in turn, brings more trophoblast cells (the start of cancer)
into being as a by-product of that process. (See chapter
IV of the book, ""World Without Cancer"", by G.
Edward Griffin, for more information on the trophoblast
thesis of cancer.) The second thing is that if not all the
malignant tissue is removed, what remains may become encased
in scar tissue from the surgery. Consequently, the cancer
tends to become insulated from the action of the pancreatic
enzymes which are essential for exposing trophoblast cells
to the surveillant action of the white blood cells. There
is also no solid evidence that surgery that patients who
submit to surgery have any greater life expectancy, on the
average, that those who do not. For more information regarding
the many studies that have been done regarding surgery,
see the book, ""World Without Cancer"", by G. Edward
Griffin.
The rationale behind X-ray therapy is the same as with
surgery. The objective is to remove the tumor, but to do
so by burning it away rather than cutting it out. Here,
also, it is primarily the non-cancer cell that is destroyed.
The more malignant the tumor, the more resistant it is to
radio therapy. If this were not so, then X-ray therapy would
have a high degree of success-which, of course, it does
not. It also increases the likelihood of cancer developing
in other parts of the body. X-rays induce cancer because
of at least two factors. First, they do physical damage
to the body whichs triggers the production of trophoblast
cells as part of the healing process. Second, they weaken
or destroy the production of white blood cells which constitutes
the immunological defense mechanism, the body's front-line
defense against cancer. As with surgery, there is little
or no solid evidence that radiation actually improves the
patient's chances for survival. For more information regarding
the many studies that have been done regarding radiation
therapy, see the book, ""World Without Cancer"",
by G. Edward Griffin.
We have now briefly viewed the miserable results obtained
by orthodox surgery and radiation. However, the record of
so-called anti-cancer drugs is even worse. The primary reason
for this is that most of them currently in use are highly
poisonous, not just to cancer but to the rest of the body
as well. Generally, they are more deadly to healthy tissue
than they are to the malignant cell. All substances can
be toxic if taken in sufficient amounts. This is true of
aspirin, sugar, Laetrile or even water. But, unlike those,
the anti-cancer drugs are poisonous, not as a result of
an overdose or as a side-effect, but as a primary effect.
In other words, anti-cancerous drugs are deliberately poisonous.
It is the desired effect. Now, these chemicals are selected
because they are capable of differentiating between types
of cells and, consequently, of poisoning some types more
than others. But don't jump to the conclusion that they
differentiate between cancer and non-cancer cells, killing
only the cancer cells, because they do not.
The cellular poisons used in orthodox cancer therapy today
cannot distinguish between cancer and non-cancer cells.
They act instead to differentiate between cells that are
fast-growing and those that are slow-growing or not growing
at all. Cells that are actively dividing are the targets.
Consequently, they kill, not only the cancer cells that
are dividing, but also a multitude of normal cells all over
the body that also are caught in the act of dividing. In
the case of a cancer that is dividing at the same rate or
even slower than normal cells, there isn't even a theoretical
chance of success in killing the cancer cells before the
poison kills the patient. Poisoning the system is the objective
of these drugs. The toxins catch the blood cells in the
act of dividing and cause blood poisoning. The gastrointestinal
systsem is thrown into convulsion causing nausea, diarrhea,
loss of appetite, cramps, and progressive weakness. Hair
cells are fast growing, so the hair falls our during treatment.
Reproductive organs are affected causing sterility.
The brain becomes fatigued. Eyesight and hearing are impaired.
Every conceivable function is disrupted with such agony
for the patient that many of them elect to die of the cancer
rather than to continue treatment. I have already said elsewhere
on this page that the personnel who administer these drugs
to cancer patients take great precautions to be sure they
themselves are not exposed to them. Because these drugs
are so dangerous, the Chemotherapy Handbook lists sixteen
OSHA safety procedures for medical personnel who work around
these drugs. The procedure for disposing needles and other
equipment used with these drugs is regulated by the Environmental
Protection Agency under the category of ""hazardous
waste"". Yet, these same substances are injected directly
into the bloodstream of hapless cancer patients supposedly
to cure their cancer! A report from the Southern Research
Institute, dated April 13, 1972, based upon research conducted
for the National Cancer Institute, indicated that most of
the accepted drugs in the American Cancer Society's ""proven
cures"" category produced cancer in laboratory animals
that previously had been healthy! Can you believe it? These
drugs are carcinogenic! How can poison and hazardous waste
products cure anyone of anything?!!!! So why do doctors
use chemotherapy if it is toxic, an immunosuppressant, carcinogenic,
and futile? The answer is that they don't know what else
to do. Doctors do not like to tell any patient that there
is no hope. In his own mind he knows there is none, but
he also knows that the patient does not want to hear that
and will seek another physician who will continue some kind
of treatment, no matter how useless or fatal it may be,
so the doctor will continue to treat the patient himself.
In his book The Wayward Cell, Cancer, Dr.
Victor Richards made it clear that chemotherapy is used
primarily just to keep the patient returning for treatment
and to build his morale while he dies. But there is more!
He said, ""Nevertheless, chemotherapy serves an extremely
valuable role in keeping patients oriented toward proper
medical therapy, and prevents the feeling of being abandoned
by the physician in patients with late and hopeless cancer.
Judicious employment and screening of potentially useful
drugs may also prevent the spread of cancer quackery.""
(Victor Richards, The Wayward Cell, Cancer; Its Origins,
Nature, and Treatment; Berkeley: The University of California
Press, 1972, pp. 215-16) Heaven forbid that anyone should
forsake the nauseating, pain-racking, cancer-spreading,
admittedly ineffective ""proven cures"" for such
""quackery"" as Laetrile! Here we have revealed,
the true goal of much of the so-called ""educational""
programs of orthodox medicine-psychologically to condition
people to not try any other forms of therapy.
So let's sum up the four different options of dealing
with cancer:
SURGERY: Least harmful. Sometimes a life-saving, stop-gap
measure. No evidence that patients who receive radical or
extensive surgical options live any longer than those who
receive the most conservative options, or, for that matter,
those who receive none at all. Believed to increase the
likelihood of disseminating cancer to other locations. When
dealing with internal tumors affecting reproductive or vital
organs, the statistical rate of long-term survival is, on
the average, 10-15%. After metastasis, the statistical chances
for long-term survival are close to zero.
RADIOLOGY: Very harmful in many ways. Spreads the cancer
and weakens the patient's resistance to other diseases.
Serious and painful side-effects, including heart failure.
No evidence that treated patients live any longer, on the
average, than those not treated. Statistical rate of long-term
survival after metastasis is close to zero.
CHEMOTHERAPY: Also spreads the cancer through weakening
of immunological defense mechanism plus general toxicity.
Leaves patient susceptible to other diseases and infections,
often leading to death from these causes.
Extremely serious side-effects. No evidence that treated
patients live any longer, on the average, than untreated
patients. Statistical rate of long-term survival after metastasis
is close to zero.
VITAMIN THERAPY: Non-toxic. Side effects include increased
appetite, weight gain, lowered blood pressure, increased
hemoglobin and red-blood cell count. Eliminates or sharply
reduces pain without narcotics. Builds up body's resistance
to other diseases. Is a natural substance found in foods
and is compatible with human biological experience. Destroys
cancer cells while nourishing non-cancer cells. Considering
that most patients begin vitamin therapy only after they
have been cut, burned, or poisoned by orthodox treatments
and have been told that there no longer is any hope, the
numbe rof patients who have been brought back to normal
health on a long-term survival basis (15%) is most encouraging.
For those who turn to vitamin therapy first, the long-term
survival rate is greater than 80%!
Wow, what a difference Laetrile does to a person. It is
my opinion that everyone should read the book ""World
Without Cancer"", by G. Edward Griffin for a clearer
understanding of cancer, the way the human body gets it,
and the politics that keep vitamin therapy outside the masses
grasp. Even if you do not have cancer, you will benefit
from this book.
Cancer does not have to be feared anymore, just like we
do not fear scurvy, rickets, beri-beri, etc. We have not
been left defenseless on this earth but we need to have
ears to hear the truth and to apply the truth to our lives
for life.
No human being loves you better than you do. No doctor,
researcher, politician, etc. Only Yahweh loves you more.
He has provided this information so we will be able to live
whole and fruitful lives, not enslaved to the political
sources behind the scenes. Study for yourself what is truth
and the truth will set you free!

Overview Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a plant grown in many parts of the world (see Question 1).The use of Cannabis for medicinal purposes dates back to ancient times (see Question 3).By federal law, possessing Cannabis is illegal in the United States (see Question 1).In the United States, Cannabis is a controlled substance that requires special licensing for its use (see Question 1 and Question 3).Cannabinoids are active chemicals in Cannabis that cause drug -like effects throughout the body, including the central nervous system and the immune system (see Question 2).Cannabinoids can be taken by mouth, inhaled, or sprayed under the tongue (see Question 5).Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the laboratory and the clinic for relief of pain, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and loss of appetite (see Question 6 and Question 7).Cannabis and cannabinoids may have benefits in treating the symptoms of cancer or the side effects of cancer therapies (see Question 7). Two cannabinoids (dronabinol and nabilone) are FDA approved for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy -related nausea and vomiting (see Question 7 and Question 10).Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory and to affect the immune system. However, there is no evidence that Cannabis' effects on the immune system help the body fight cancer (see Question 6).At this time, there is not enough evidence to recommend that patients inhale or ingest Cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related symptoms or side effects of cancer therapy (see Question 7).Cannabis is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment (see Question 9).
Questions and Answers About Cannabis What is Cannabis? Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a plant from Central Asia that is grown in many parts of the world today. In the United States, it is a controlled substance and has been classified as a Schedule I agent (a drug with increased potential for abuse and no known medical use). By federal law, possessing Cannabis (marijuana), is illegal in the United States. What are cannabinoids? Cannabinoids are active chemicals in Cannabis that cause drug-like effects throughout the body, including the central nervous system and the immune system. They are also known as phytocannabinoids. The main active cannabinoid in Cannabis is delta-9-THC. Another active cannabinoid is cannabidiol, which may relieve pain and lower inflammation without causing the ""high"" of delta-9-THC. Cannabinoids may be useful in treating the side effects of cancer and cancer treatment. Other possible effects of cannabinoids include: Anti-inflammatory activity.Blocking cell growth.Preventing the growth of blood vessels that supply tumors.Antiviral activity. What is the history of the medical use of Cannabis? The use of Cannabis for medicinal purposes dates back at least 3,000 years. It came into use in Western medicine in the 19th century and was said to relieve pain, inflammation, spasms, and convulsions. In 1937, the U.S. Treasury began taxing Cannabis under the Marijuana Tax Act at one dollar per ounce for medicinal use and one hundred dollars per ounce for recreational use. The American Medical Association (AMA) opposed this regulation of Cannabis and did not want studies of its potential medicinal benefits to be limited. In 1942, Cannabis was removed from the U.S. Pharmacopoeia because of continuing concerns about its safety. In 1951, Congress passed the Boggs Act, which included Cannabis with narcotic drugs for the first time. Under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana was classified as a Schedule I drug. Other Schedule I drugs include heroin, LSD, mescaline, methaqualone, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Although Cannabis was not believed to have any medicinal use, the U.S. government distributed it to patients on a case-by-case basis under the Compassionate Use Investigational New Drug (IND) program between 1978 and 1992. In the past 20 years, researchers have studied how cannabinoids act on the brain and other parts of the body. Cannabinoid receptors (molecules that bind cannabinoids) have been discovered in brain cells and nerve cells in other parts of the body. The presence of cannabinoid receptors on immune system cells suggests that cannabinoids may have a role in immunity. If Cannabis is illegal, how do some cancer patients in the United States use it? Though federal law prohibits the use of Cannabis, 16 states and the District of Columbia permit its use for certain medical conditions. How is Cannabis administered? Cannabis may be taken by mouth or may be inhaled. When taken by mouth (in baked products or as an herbal tea), the main psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis (delta-9-THC) is processed by the liver, making an additional psychoactive chemical (a substance that acts on the brain and changes mood or consciousness). When Cannabis is smoked and inhaled, cannabinoids quickly enter the bloodstream. The additional psychoactive chemical is produced in smaller amounts than when taken by mouth. A growing number of clinical trials are studying a medicine made from a whole-plant extract of Cannabis that contains specific amounts of cannabinoids. This medicine is sprayed under the tongue. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Cannabis or cannabinoids? Preclinical studies of cannabinoids have investigated the following activities: Antitumor activity Studies in mice and rats have shown that cannabinoids may inhibit tumor growth by causing cell death, blocking cell growth, and blocking the development of blood vessels needed by tumors to grow. Laboratory and animal studies have shown that cannabinoids may be able to kill cancer cells while protecting normal cells.A study in mice showed that cannabinoids may protect against inflammation of the colon and may have potential in reducing the risk of colon cancer, and possibly in its treatment.A laboratory study of delta-9-THC in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) cells showed that it damaged or killed the cancer cells. The same study of delta-9-THC in mouse models of liver cancer showed that it had antitumor effects. Delta-9-THC has been shown to cause these effects by acting on molecules that may also be found in non-small cell lung cancer cells and breast cancer cells. Stimulating appetite Many animal studies have shown that delta-9-THC and other cannabinoids stimulate appetite and can increase food intake. Pain relief Cannabinoid receptors (molecules that bind cannabinoids) have been studied in the brain, spinal cord, and nerve endings throughout the body to understand their roles in pain relief. Cannabinoids have been studied for anti-inflammatory effects that may play a role in pain relief. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of Cannabis or cannabinoid use by cancer patients been conducted? No clinical trials of Cannabis as a treatment for cancer in humans have been found in the CAM on PubMed database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in clinical trials for ways to manage side effects of cancer and cancer therapies, including the following: Nausea and vomiting Delta-9-THC taken by mouth: Two cannabinoid drugs approved in the United States are available under the names dronabinol and nabilone. Both dronabinol and nabilone are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chemotherapy -related nausea and vomiting in patients who have not responded to standard therapy. Many clinical trials have shown that both dronabinol and nabilone worked as well as or better than some of the weaker FDA-approved drugs to relieve nausea and vomiting. Newer drugs given for chemotherapy-related nausea have not been directly compared with Cannabis or cannabinoids in cancer patients.Inhaled Cannabis: Three small trials have studied inhaled Cannabis for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting. Various study methods and chemotherapy agents were used with mixed results. There is not enough information to interpret these findings. Stimulating appetite Delta-9-THC taken by mouth: A clinical trial compared delta-9-THC (dronabinol) and a standard drug (megestrol) in patients with advanced cancer and loss of appetite. Results showed that delta-9-THC was not as effective in increasing appetite or weight gain in advanced cancer patients compared with standard therapy. However, a clinical trial of patients with HIV/AIDS and weight loss found that those who took delta-9-THC had increased appetite and stopped losing weight compared with patients who took a placebo.Inhaled Cannabis: There are no published studies of the effect of inhaled Cannabis on cancer patients with loss of appetite. Studies of healthy people who inhaled Cannabis showed that they consumed more calories, especially high-fat and sweet snacks. Pain relief Combining cannabinoids with opioids: Results from a small study of 21 patients with chronic pain (mostly from non-cancer conditions) show that adding vaporized Cannabis to slow-release oxycodone or morphine gave patients better pain relief, even though in some instances blood levels of opioids were lower after Cannabis was added.Delta-9-THC taken by mouth: Two small clinical trials of oral delta-9-THC showed that it relieved cancer pain. In the first study, patients had good pain relief as well as relief of nausea and vomiting and better appetite. A second study showed that delta-9-THC could be given in doses that gave pain relief comparable to codeine. Higher doses of delta-9-THC were found to be more calming than codeine. An observational study of nabilone also showed that it relieved cancer pain along with nausea, anxiety, and distress when compared with no treatment. Neither dronabinol nor nabilone is approved by the FDA for pain management.Whole Cannabis plant extract medicine: A study of a whole-plant extract of Cannabis that contained specific amounts of cannabinoids, which was sprayed in the mouth, found it was effective in patients with advanced cancer whose pain was not relieved by strong opioids alone.Inhaled Cannabis: A study of inhaled Cannabis in patients with HIV -related peripheral neuropathy found better pain control in the Cannabis group than in the placebo group. To date, no clinical trials have studied cannabinoids in the treatment of chemotherapy-related neuropathy in patients with cancer. Anxiety and sleep Inhaled Cannabis: A small case series found that patients who inhaled marijuana had improved mood, improved sense of well-being, and less anxiety.Whole Cannabis plant extract spray: A trial of a whole-plant extract of Cannabis that contained specific amounts of cannabinoids, which was sprayed under the tongue, found that patients had improved sleep quality. Have any side effects or risks been reported from Cannabis and cannabinoids? Adverse side effects of cannabinoids may include: Rapid beating of the heart.Low blood pressure.Muscle relaxation.Bloodshot eyes.Slowed digestion and movement of food by the stomach and intestines.Dizziness.Depression.Hallucinations.Paranoia. Both Cannabis and cannabinoids may be addictive. Symptoms of withdrawal from cannabinoids may include: Irritability.Trouble sleeping.Restlessness.Hot flashes.Nausea and cramping (rarely occur). These symptoms are mild compared to withdrawal from opiates and usually lessen after a few days. Is Cannabis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved Cannabis for use as a cancer treatment. Are Cannabis or cannabinoids approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a treatment for cancer-related symptoms or side effects of cancer therapy? Cannabis is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of any cancer-related symptom or side effect of cancer therapy. Two cannabinoids (dronabinol and nabilone) are approved by the FDA for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in patients who have not responded to standard therapy.
Current Clinical TrialsCheck NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials for cancer CAM clinical trials on marijuana, nabilone, dronabinol and nabiximols that are actively enrolling patients. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.
Changes to This Summary (12/16/2011)The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Changes were made to this summary to match those made to the health professional version. In writing Cancer Information Summaries, PDQ Editorial Boards review current evidence. They do not make recommendations or develop guidelines. Their work is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This summary on Cannabis and cannabinoids does not represent a policy statement of NCI or NIH. The summary statement represents an independent review of the literature; that review is not influenced by NCI or any other federal agency.
General CAM InformationComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.
Evaluation of CAM ApproachesIt is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful. The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.
Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAMWhen considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected?What are the risks associated with this therapy?Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?What benefits can be expected from this therapy?Will the therapy interfere with conventional treatment?Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?If so, who is sponsoring the trial?Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?

Apricot kernels and Cancer
Apricot kernels are known not just for their nutritional properties but also because of its single most important ingredient – amygdalin, which is commonly known as vitamin B17, and is known to have anti-cancer properties. While vitamin B17 is available in plenty in a host of other foods, but have somehow absent from the regular diet pattern followed in the western world. people who still follow a traditional system of diet, have adequate consumption of this particular vitamin and run lesser risk of developing cancer. For instance, some of the other foods which are rich in amygdalin or vitamin B17 include bitter almonds, apple pips, grape seeds, millet, broad beans and others. Many of the beans and grains which have been grown from hybrids do not contain adequate amounts of amygdalin like American orange pips. While this ingredient is available in almonds, sweet almonds do not contain this vitamin as amygdalin is bitter in taste. Fighting cancer can be done in various ways; one of the most popular methods is to build a strong immunity towards this dreaded disease. The other method is putting in supplemental efforts through antioxidants which have the properties of fighting carcinogenic cells in the body. The amygdalin content of apricot kernels however act in a unique way – it combats the cancer cells directly. The discovery and extract of amygdalin is not recent. In fact, the compound finds its name in various pharmacopeias for over a century. Since its discovery over a century ago, the compound has been known to be non-toxic. Research however has shown that it does contain a toxic substance, a poison to be precise, called cyanide which can be fatal. The cyanide content of amygdalin in the apricot kernels however is in a latent and dormant state and only excessive consumption of amagdalin can have fatal outcome. Just like common salt contains chlorine as one of its ‘harmful’ contents, it can only prove fatal to human, with excessive consumption. Amygdalin however is far less toxic than salt or sugar. While every human body has the capability to deal with the inherent cancer cells with the power of its own immune system, sometimes there are situations which trigger a feverish increment of cancer cells in our body. Situations like a particular weak part of the body, over and continuous exposure to
dangerous carcinogens, overtly stressful conditions etc can create multiple and powerful cancer cells in our body which overpower our immune system and we fall prey to cancer. Amygdalin in the apricot cells come in to assist our body’s immune system to fight the cancer cells directly. Every cancer cell contains a specific enzyme which lets out the poison contained within the amygdalin and this is how the cancer cells are killed. While healthy cells do not contain this enzyme, they can however release some nutrients and neutralizing agents which have the capacity to neutralize any poison it came in contact with. Researchers at Imperial College London, while doing trials with cyanide to kill cancer cells have observed that any poison which might escape into the blood stream is quickly neutralized by the renal system. © e-natureguide.com Buy herbal remedies, medicine, creams and other herbal alternative products online,including male enhancement and women’s health supplements.

Detoxification
Details
By
Ted H. Spence
DDS, ND, PhD/DSc, MPH
Introduction
Detoxification comes in many forms and refers to many different programs
that cleanse the body of toxins. Today, our environment is toxic and
the foods we eat, even the air we breathe and the water we drink is
laden with chemicals foreign to our system. Therefore, everyone is
undergoing some type of detoxification to maintain life and health.
Although basic detoxification begins with diet, detox programs may
include nutritional fortification for the liver, lungs, kidneys, bowels
and blood.
We will
soon see why these organs are so important in detoxification. Detoxification
for the body may refer to the cleansing of the bowels, kidneys, lungs,
the liver or the blood, since these are the organs involved in detoxification
of chemicals and toxins from the body. The liver acts as an ""in-line""
filter for the removal of foreign substances and wastes from the blood.
The kidneys filter wastes from the blood into the urine, while the
lungs remove volatile gases as we breathe.
Our body
is designed to utilize natural substances, which includes foods, herbs
and phytochemicals. Any foreign substance will serve as a stimulus
to our immune system, which has the function of removing these substances.
Although the toxicity of a chemical may vary, it is the job of the
liver to reduce toxins into compounds that the body can safely handle
and eliminate through the kidneys (as urine), skin (as sweat), lungs
(as expelled air) and bowels (as feces). Maintaining these eliminative
organs in good working order is essential for one's good health to
continue.
While
there are many detoxification programs available, they differ in their
actions and their intent. Some detoxification programs (DP) work only
with the bowels, others may cleanse the liver or the blood, and others
may aid the kidneys or the skin in their functions. By combining these
detox programs into a total health program, one can effectively restore
their health to an optimal level and look younger in the process.
When the body can eliminate toxins, then health is restored and energy
and vigor are revitalized. Many different approaches to detoxification
and wellness will work, even though they attack the problem at different
levels. Any program that augments detoxification will improve health.
Other factors must be considered in detoxification, like nutrition,
water, and exercise, rest, sunshine, and fresh air.
Detoxification
Diets
Detoxification diets help the body to eliminate toxins in many ways.
First, natural vegetarian diets include the fiber needed for stimulating
good bowel eliminate. They also contain the proper amounts of vitamins
that feed and nourish the bowels and the liver, as well as other eliminative
organs. They also include a valuable source of enzymes since most
vegetarian diets are eaten raw. The elimination of meat from the diet
for a short period enhances detoxification because meat is so difficult
to digest and requires many enzymes for its digestion. Therefore,
vegetarian diets are cleansing diets and aid the body in elimination
of toxins.
Of course,
changing diets and lifestyle is easier said than done for some people.
Many people want health and will go to any length to improve their
health, including dietary changes. But there are others who do not
want to change their life style for anything. These people will be
difficult to motivate and will not stick with the detox programs for
one day. They may not want to give up their sodas, or their cigarettes,
their beer or their coffee. They may make a few changes, like
drinking more water, or they may give up completely in a very short
notice. Our way of eating has been cultivated over many years and
will not change over night. But to those who do want better health
and do not want to rely on pills/drugs for their existence, nutritional
changes will be welcomed, especially when they start feeling better
and having more energy.
Diets
are very important and are usually the basis for any detox program,
whether it is herbs, cleansing or other detox programs.[i]
Detox diets will generally
eliminate trigger foods, which may cause many problems with digestion
and elimination. Foods like wheat (glutens) and dairy (milk, cheese)
are often the cause of allergies. Sugar is eliminated because of its
""empty calories"" and tendency to produce hypoglycemia. Meats are eliminated
because they may contain hormones, antibiotics and are difficult to
digest. Caffeine is wise to avoid, since it has many ill effects on
the body's digestion. Refined, processed and junk foods are also out
for any detox program to work.
Herbal
Detoxification
Generic diets for detoxification are good, but may not stimulate the
liver, lungs or the kidneys as much as one would like. Therefore,
herbal cleanses are indicated when we want to hone our cleanse to
a ""sharp edge"" and be organ specific. Of course, herbs are foods too
and provide one with vitamins, minerals and enzymes for excellent
nutrition. Herbs are powerful, because they may be combined together
to fortify those herbs that aid specific organs. For example, herbal
combinations that aid the liver may be found in many organic food
stores. The list below shows how herbal combinations help the
various organs.

While
herbs may be taken at any time, they are best for detoxification purposes
when they are used with a good diet also. It does not make any
sense to take herbs to cleanse the liver if the bowels are clogged
with junk or refined foods, since the liver dumps its toxins into
the bowels. And while detoxification diets are effective by themselves,
they may be reinforced and speeded up with herbs, which stimulate
the eliminative organs.
Herbs
may be used as teas, powders or extracts. Powders are usually encapsulated
for easier swallowing, but are best when taken with meals and digestive
enzymes. Extracts may be used when specific herbs are needed, but
may be extracted with alcohol, which we need to avoid. Herbal teas
are easily made and easily taken all throughout the day. They are
mild and gentle and sometimes refreshing and sometimes bitter. Experimentation
may be in order until one develops the right tea to drink. Herbal
teas is a topic in itself, since there are so many and different ways
to make them.
Example
Herbal Cleanse
Rising
Drink a glass of lemon water or drink a glass of water with added:
one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and one teaspoon of blackstrap
molasses
Morning
Drink a glass of water with psyllium husk powder (follow with
another glass of water).
Meals
Take 2-3 multi-digestive enzymes
Take liver herbs
In
Between Meals
Drink herbals teas which support the liver, including Dandelion/licorice/ginger/fennel
Note:
Following a good diet is mandatory for herbs to work optimally. See
section on diets for detox.
Skin
Cleansing
Detoxification should include some type of skin cleansing, because
our skin it one of our best eliminative organs. Heavy metals are actually
released through the skin's pores when we sweat. Sauna baths and steam
rooms are great for removing toxins from the skin and regenerating
one's health and energy. It has been documented that our skin's sweat
glands when combined can perform as much detoxification as one (or
both) kidneys. Therefore, it is very important to support our skin
for detoxification to be maximal. If our kidneys are damaged, then
helping the skin will help the kidneys ... indirectly, but effectively.
Good
skin care is in order, if one's health is to benefit, also. Using
chemicalized skin care products is not wise, even though they are
cheaper. These chemicals may be absorbed into our circulation and
provide more ""toxins"" for our liver to deal with. We are not
made out of cast iron, and even the chemicals in our soaps and shampoos
will make a difference with our health. Most people do not ""see"" the
ill effects of these subtle chemicals, because their liver is able
to metabolize them. But, individuals who are environmentally toxic
will see a great change in their health when using natural soaps and
shampoos. We should take their advice and use only natural skin care
products also.
Cleansing
our skin is rather simple. First, we need to bathe daily using natural
soaps. Then we need to care for the skin by using only natural oils
and products of natural origin. Even the clothes we wear can make
a big difference in our health. Synthetic fibers do not absorb sweat
(toxins), while natural fibers, like cotton, will absorb toxins. Dry
skin brushing helps in removing the outer dead skin layers and keeps
the pores open. Another good method of skin brushing is with vigorous
toweling off after bathing. Towel roughly until the skin is slightly
red. Change towels often because they will contain toxins.
Good
skin care also requires good nutrition.[ii] Since
our skin is mainly fat, we need high quality fats and oil from natural
sources to give our skin health. Butter and olive oil are two excellent
natural oils, which keep the skin in good condition. As always, the
fats/oils should be natural ... only.
Detoxification
Baths
Use 1/2 cup of baking soda or use 1/2 cup of Epsom salt or use 1/2
cup of sea salt. Soak for 15-20 minutes and then scrub the skin gently
with soap on a natural fiber. Within a few minutes the water will
turn murky and ""dirty."" The darkness to the water is heavy metals
coming out of the skin (aluminum and mercury). Do this once a week
during detox and once a month for maintenance.
Juice
Fasting
Fasting with vegetable juices can be another excellent way to develop
good health and cleanse the body of toxins. Juices, minus their pulp
(fiber), contain an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and enzymes.
When the pulp is not added, one is able to drink more juice than they
are able to eat. For example, one can easily consume the juice of
several heads of lettuce in one sitting, but may not be able to eat
the lettuce whole. This allows the body to get an abundance of nutrients
with minimal processing (digestion). Fasting on mono-juices also allows
the body proper time to process these juices and helps to preserve
our valuable digestive enzymes.
Juice
fasting has helped many people over come serious diseases like
cancer, because it gave them optimal nutrition and allowed the body
to cleanse itself of toxins. [According to many nutritionists, cancer
is merely a toxic condition.] With some juicers,
the pulp is discarded, but it may be saved and added back for fiber
(not too much). Juices contain good sources of antioxidants and enzymes,
both of which are needed for cleansing and eliminating toxins. Juices
are also easy to digest and help those with digestive problems.
Flora
Our bowel flora is also important for detoxification and normal health.
Probiotics is the term given to the normal bowel flora, which are
taken as supplements. It has been found that these normal flora actually
defend our body from the pathogenic species of bacteria and perform
many vital functions, such as detoxification of toxic chemicals and
making valuable vitamins (mainly the B vitamins). When our normal
flora are present they secrete mediators in which the pathogenic forms
cannot grow. But the reverse is also true, that when the pathogenic
forms take over, they will exclude the normal flora with their toxins.
Many
scientists feel that it is the toxins secreted from the pathogens
and not the pathogens themselves that create disease. The ability
of all bacteria to change and grow under specific conditions of their
immediate environment is called pleiomorphism. Cell wall deficient
forms are ""bacteria"" which lack a defined cell wall, yet have all
the specifications of being bacterial-like. Even viruses have been
found to exhibit morphological forms, which resemble bacteria and
fungus. While this is not widely accepted by modern medical scientists,
it has been proven beyond a shadow of doubt by eminent scientists,
like Virginia Livingston Wheeler, Irene Diller, and Royal Rife. Their
microscopic studies have revealed that bacteria and viruses and fungus
may be all different forms of the same organism, differing only by
the environment in which they are grown.
Antibiotics
kill off the good bacteria as well as the bad and allow the bad to
repopulate and develop antibiotic resistance. Natural forms of antibiotics
are better, since they do not kill off the good bacteria with the
bad and do not allow drug"" resistance to take place. Garlic, for example,
is perhaps, 200 times more effective against pathogens than most antibiotics
today. And it does not produce antibiotic resistance forms, which
is a danger to all our health. As antibiotics become more widely used,
more antibiotic resistant forms will be encountered. Herbal antiseptics
and antibacterial tonics are far better and less dangerous to our
over-all health, because they do not kill of the good bacteria with
the bad.
Replacing
our natural flora is a good step for preventing disease and keeping
our bowels healthy and populated with normal flora. Taking probiotics
containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidus can help us in our
detox program and also in repopulating the gut after a cleanse.
Our normal healthy flora should be a part of any detoxification program.
Antioxidants
The use of antioxidants, like vitamins A, E, and especially C, are
very essential for detoxification since they are involved with the
detoxification of toxins. Antioxidants are involved with helping cells
to neutralize free radicals that can cause mutations and cellular
damage. As these free radicals are neutralized, the antioxidant vitamins
will be used and exhibit low levels. Vitamin A and E are fat soluble
and will be found in our fat tissues/stores, but vitamin C is water
soluble and will be found mainly in our skin (between the cells according
to Reams). Vitamin C is also involved with many other important bodily
functions, like collagen formation, wound healing, energy production
and fighting off colds (viruses).
The function
of antioxidants is so important that any deficiency of them will be
seen as catastrophic to one's health. When our antioxidants are low,
energy is not available and detoxification cannot take place in a
normal fashion. Therefore, toxins accumulate or are stored until they
can be processed. The liver and many other organs are compromised
in their functions when antioxidants are low. Just the lack of energy
is enough to cause the body to have compromised or poor health, because
it is energy that is required for the removal of toxins and wastes.
Vitamin
C should be taken with bioflavinoids to ensure that all the components
of the vitamin C complex are taken together, since they work together.
Pure ascorbic acid is called vitamin C, but does little by itself.
We tend to think that ascorbic acid as vitamin C, but it is only part
of the vitamin C complex. Vitamin C is very essential to any detoxification
program, because that is what the body uses for energy to process
and eliminate these toxic waste Vitamin C can be taken in very high
doses until the bowel tolerance level [BTL] is achieved. This BTL
is different for different people. Some persons reach tolerance at
4-5 grams (4,000-5,000 mg), while others may not reach tolerance until
10-15 grams (10,000-15,000 mg). Cancer patients notoriously can take
20-30 grams (20,000-30,000 mg) of vitamin C before tolerance is reached
... meaning that they needed more vitamin C than most people.
By taking
vitamin C to its tolerance level we find out 1) what our BTL is and
2) how saturated our body is with Vitamin C. Vitamin C was found
by Linus Pauling and Ewan Cameron to be very effective in helping
many patients to over come that killer disease, called cancer. Perhaps,
this was because vitamin C was needed for detoxification of toxins,
which ""caused"" the cancer in the first place. Although Pauling and
Cameron were greatly criticized for their work with vitamin C, they
were able to help many people overcome cancer and without compromising
their health with toxic drugs.
Enzymes
The use of enzymes in detoxification is important, because the body
needs an adequate supply of enzymes, not only for digestion, for also
for detoxification.[iii] Enzymes are best obtained
from fresh raw fruits and vegetables, but may be taken daily with
meals as nutritional supplements of multi-digestive enzymes. Enzymes
in our food helps us to digest that food, but many foods today are
processed, refined, heated (cooked), radiated and stored, which destroys
enzymes and leaves it non-vital.[iv] Foods with
enzymes destroyed will have a longer shelf life, but will not give
one health when it is eaten.
Fresh
raw fruits and vegetables are the best source for enzymes and help
to give one vibrant health. Enzymes are also used by the body
in detoxification of toxic substances. The liver is the source of
most detoxification enzymes, which it must make, or store. To aid
the body in removing and eliminating wastes and toxins, enzymes
are best taken in between meals. This way they do not get involved
with digestion, but go to the liver and to the blood for detoxification.
Many
therapies have utilized enzymes for improving health and enzymes have
long been the key to many detoxification therapies which have helped
many to over come that dreaded disease, cancer. Kelley, Gerson, Moerman,
and Neiper used alternative nutritional therapies with enzymes
for curing cancer. The famous Wobe Mugos enzymes from Europe were
utilized with Laetrile therapies for cancer. Never was Laetrile give
alone, but was used with vitamins, diet and enzymes. This made the
Laetrile therapy very successful in the 1970s. If cancer is a toxic
condition, which many feel that it is, then taking enzymes will help
it. And it does.
The use
of raw foods in many detoxification diets are using the enzymes found
naturally in those foods. Additionally, these raw foods provide fiber
and, with proper food combining, will not waste the body enzymes reserves.
Preserving enzymes is the key to over coming disease and living to
ripe old age and remaining healthy. Yes, vitamins and minerals
are important, but vitamins are enzyme co-factors and many minerals
are use to activate enzymes. Therefore, the vitamins and minerals
themselves are only augmenting the role of the enzymes which are detoxifying
toxins and supporting metabolism.
Enzymes
also help the bowels in cleansing, because they liquefy the bowel
content, which makes transit much easier. The role of enzymes in digestion
is to break down foods for digestion and absorption. When foods are
broken down they become more liquid and the bowels move much easier
and faster. Transit time is decreased and our health is increased
when toxins are removed and eliminated. Perhaps, this is a link
to breaking the ""constipation chain."" Enzymes are the key to health.
Preserve our enzymes and we will be healthy for a long time.
Bowel
Cleansing
Keeping the bowels clean and moving is a major step in regaining our
health since the bowels are crucial in the elimination of toxins,
especially those processed by the liver. [The liver dumps in to the
bowel via the gall bladder.] This is why one hears a lot about the
bowels, and bowel cleansing. In severe cases, enemas and colonics
may be needed to breakup and washout long-standing bowel encrustations.
Diet may do the same thing as an enema or colonic, it will just take
longer. Also, one should be very diligent in repopulating after a
total washout of the normal flora and probiotics will be necessary
to restore that balance.
Constipation
is a national pastime and slow bowels are more common today than years
previous. For one thing, people not only ate better 100 years ago,
they were more active and got out doors more. When the bowels
slow down, toxins are not eliminated and are reabsorbed and carried
back to the liver for recycling and elimination. Reabsorbed bile salts
have been linked to increased cholesterol levels; therefore, cholesterol
is a major indicator of constipation. Also, when the bowels get slow
and toxin levels increase, the pathogenic microorganisms grow to out-number
the normal flora causing dysbiosis. Although flora is needed
to correct this, it is the clogged bowels that are the major problem.
When the bowels move again, everything else will fall into order.
Our endocrine
glands that control metabolism are also involved; since it is our
thyroid that controls metabolism and metabolism affects how our bowels
are functioning. In this way, constipation can be seen as a symptom
of hypothyroidism. Low body temperatures (a symptom of hypothyroidism)
are very common today ...although they are not ""normal"" ... as many
authors have reported. One major factor in low body temperatures is
the suppression of thyroid function by heavy metals, like mercury,
which binds to our thyroid hormones and renders them inactive. Eliminate
the mercury and the body temperature is likely to return to normal.
The easiest
way to get the bowels moving is by using a high fiber diet consisting
of fresh fruits and vegetables. Sometimes, one may add extra
fiber during the day by drinking a glass of water (juice) with psyllium
husk powder. The extra fiber adds to the bulk of the stool and decreases
the bowel transit time, which means better toxin elimination and better
health. It makes sense that if one can eliminate toxins their
health will improve.
One of
the best ways to improve the bowel function is with herbal remedies
that act as bowel stimulants or laxatives. These products range from
the very mild - slippery elm - to the stimulant - cascara sagrada-
to the very harsh - aloes and senna. Everyone may react differently
to these products, so they should be taken cautiously at first. Some
persons may take two aloes with no effect (meaning they are heavily
blocked), while others may take a mild herbal and get a much greater
effect than most. Herbal bowel combination formulas are excellent
because they not only stimulate the bowels to move, but give the bowels
the nourishment it needs to move on its own.
Herbal
formulas should not preclude a wholesome
natural diet, since diet comes first in matters of health. One
should not become overly dependent on herbal laxatives, since they
deplete potassium and may be ""addicting"" as some authors claim. Yet,
herbal products play a key role in getting the body to eliminate toxins
by stimulating the eliminative organs like nothing else can and, therefore,
cannot be ignored.
Herxheimer
Reaction
The Herxheimer Reaction occurs when the body is detoxifying too rapidly
and toxins are being released faster than the body can eliminate them.[v]
When this occurs, one will suffer from headaches, nausea, vomiting,
and malaise. Even though this is but a short period of the health
program, it can be severe and deter one from reaching their intended
goals. Also, the person may not know what they are experiencing
and think that they are regressing.
To
minimize the Herxheimer Reaction:
Drinks
lots of pure water
Get
minimal exercise daily
Lots
of sunshine
Take
detoxification slowly... one step at a time
Don't
increase the dose of herbals
Keep
the organs of elimination (bowels, lungs, skin, kidneys) open
Take
detox baths
Use
aromatherapy oils for aches -like peppermint, birch, and wintergreen
Sweat
by using exercise, saunas, baths, and herbs
Avoid
foreign chemicals and refined processed foods
If the
Herxheimer reaction occurs, cut back on your health detoxification
program. Reduce the dose of herbs and follow the above outline to
reduce the symptoms of toxin elimination. The more toxins there are
to eliminate, the sicker one is when they come out. Generally, one
will feel better when all is over and health is restored again. Just
remember, don't give up.
Conclusion
Detoxification may produce symptoms of headaches, nausea, malaise
and vomiting due to the toxins being released [Herxheimer Reaction].
If this occurs, one should back off the program and proceed slowly.
Proceeding to fast with detoxification can have disastrous results
when toxins are released into the circulation. Our body should
be primed and ready to eliminate toxins before they are released.
We do this by getting the bowels working, keeping the skin clean and
getting the kidneys and lungs operating. Only by having all
organs of elimination in proper operating order can our body begin
to dump toxins efficiently and maximally. Keeping the skin clean and
healthy is of prime importance also.
Detoxification
is essential for good health to exist. Our body must eliminate toxins
daily or we would die immediately. Since our environment is more toxic
today, our livers are over stressed with environmental toxins to deal
with daily. Processing other toxins, when the liver is stressed, may
be delayed. Detoxification is also a lifestyle change. For it is by
the way we live that determines our health and how our liver processes
toxins. Detoxification is
easy if we eat a wholesome natural organic diet and live life in a
natural way. But for those who want their cake and eat it too,
detoxification may be compromised. A change your lifestyle may be
needed and detoxification will be forthcoming. Nature has afforded
us the chance to live in a toxic environment and not be affected by
it. Of course, we have to live right to get that chance. Without detoxification
we may not get a second chance.
Good
health is within our reach, but first we must cleanse this ""temple""
and eat a wholesome natural diet that provides us with maximal nutrients
and fiber. Herbs can help us stimulate the liver, lungs, kidneys and
bowels when needed, but diet is the first priority in any detoxification
program. Don't become overly dependent on herbal laxatives. When toxins
are released one may feel bad for a day or two, but when our good
health is restored we will have renewed energy and will ""soar on the
wings of an eagle"". Many people living today have never known
what good health ""feels"" like. They survive with an abundance of toxins
and an existence less than healthy.
Good
health is not hard to find, but does require diligence and life style
changes which are compatible with toxin elimination. Sir Jason
Winters Says, ""Death begins in the colon."" With good toxin elimination
through natural detoxification programs our health and energy are
restored.

Moss, Ph.D. It is sometimes claimed that ""quackbusting"" has been neutralized by the existence of the OAM. Apparently not, as was demonstrated by an eight-page article, ""Alternative medicine�or quackery?"" dated 6/15/94, and published in Patient Care, a magazine for doctors. The article was ""prepared"" by one Malorye Allison. Above the title, however, are listed four names: ""Helene Brown; Barrie Cassileth, PhD; Jerry P. Lewis, MD; and John H. Renner, MD.: These people are identi�ed as ""Article Consultants,"" with brief biographies, in a box at the bottom of page one. Cassileth is also a member of the OAM advisory board (AMPAC) and the American Cancer Society�s ""questionable methods"" subcommittee. In a letter to AMPAC members (8/16/94), Cassileth claimed that some board members may have been ""stating or insinuating"" that her views rendered her an inappropriate member of the Council. She angrily denied that the Patient Care article, which uses her name, was an expression of her views. ""That is simply not true,"" she said. The article, however, is typical of the ACS quackbusting subcommittee on which she serves. In the article, patients who use alternative medicine are depicted as a pitiable and contemptible lot: the ""sickest and most desperate...in pursuit of immediate relief,"" seeking ""quick cures either of no value or outright dangerous."" Bene�ts are ascribed to the ""placebo effect."" There are some astonishing leaps of logic. The article states that ""bee venom�can cause anaphylactic shock in susceptible patients."" It follows this statement with a parenthetical remark: ""A hockey coach in Michigan was forced to resign earlier this year for giving bee pollen pills to help 'energize' his 7- and 8-year-old players just before a play-off game."" There is no recognition of the fact that bee venom injections are essentially different than bee pollen pills, and taking something yourself is different than giving it to unrelated minors. Some of the more ""dangerous"" alternative treatments, we are told, are ""daily enemas"" or ""a morning glass of urine."" (Exploiting fear and loathing of human waste is a gambit found in many such quack attacks.) ""The treatment of allergies,"" they also claim, ""is a particularly popular playground for quacks�."" ""Conventional medicine may label these patients as hypochondriacs,"" the article reassures conventional doctors, ""but they have found a sympathetic ear, particularly in the �eld of clinical ecology, where environmental sensitivity is treated as seriously as any other allergy."" So, to get yourself labelled a quack, take your patients complaints seriously and treat them sympathetically. Cancer therapy, it says, has ""the longest and most tragic history of quackery"" and ""patients with cancer and AIDS are vulnerable to promoters of unproven therapies."" There is no mention of the unproven uses of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Even in many so-called terminal cases, doctors are told, it is ""clearly unwise"" to counsel patients to take alternative treatments. ""Severely wasted patients"" should not take mega-vitamins (no reason given) and should not be encouraged to fast. (Who is advising this?) ""Most often,"" doctors are reassured, ""unproven cancer therapies remain unproven because their developers won�t allow them to be studied."" In fact, the OAM has been besieged by hundreds of developers wanting their treatments evaluated. Those who don't want their treatments studied are really a small fraction, not typical. Even alternative medicine�s proper emphasis on ""the right mental attitude"" is twisted to allegedly mean ""if you aren't cured, it�s your own fault."" ""Examples of these [quack] treatments"" are IAT immune therapy, the Hoxsey herbs, and the Gerson diet. And, of course, laetrile: ""Studies have con�rmed that it is ineffective and potentially toxic."" There is no mention of Dr. Sugiura's positive results at Sloan-Kettering. Cancell's promoters are accused of ""selling"" their treatment, when in fact they gave it away free to thousands. Shark cartilage is called ""the miracle cure of the moment"" and it is said that OAM ""has no immediate plans for additional clinical trials."" But, at least on paper, OAM has scheduled a �eld investigation of cartilage. Most shockingly, doctors are urged to turn in ""promoters of quack therapies"" to ""the FDA, the consumer protection division of your state attorney general�s of�ce, the state medical licensing board, or even the post of�ce...."" If these are not Dr. Cassileth�s opinions, as she avers, why doesn't she renounce them in print, or, better yet, resign from the ACS committee that gives them birth? GLASS HOUSES DEPARTMENT The Patient Care article not only provides lessons in medical heresy detection but in literary sleuthing, as well. We learn that ""books about quackeries�are usually reprinted without any editing, so that the same typographical errors occur in edition after edition."" Talking about editing, however, the article claims that the famous Hoxsey herbal method was ""developed in the 1950s."" But Harry Hoxsey offered his treatment starting in 1924, based on a formula he claimed was ""developed in 1840"" by his great-grandfather, according to the OTA report on unconventional cancer treatments. ### Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D. is the author of eight books and three documentaries on cancer-related topics. He is an advisor on alternative cancer treatments to the National Institutes of Health, Columbia University, and the University of Texas. He researches and writes individualized ""Healing Choices"" reports for people with cancer.

Vitamins Are An Essential Part Of A Healthy Diet
Vitamins are organic substances functioning to facilitate an
essential biochemical reaction necessary for growth, vitality and the
normal functioning of our bodies. We must obtain them from our diet or
take them in the form of dietary supplements, that are usually derived
from plant and animal products. Crucial to the definition of a vitamin
is that lack of it produces a specific deficiency syndrome, and
supplying it cures that deficiency.
It is almost impossible to sustain a healthy way of life by taking
only synthetic supplements and not following a good eating plan.
Supplements should be taken only with some nutrition knowledge or the
guidance of a nutritionist and dietitian. Many vitamins and minerals
can be toxic if taken in excess. Often there are sufficient vitamins in
your diet, thus by taking supplements toxicity may occur. Symptoms
include hair loss, blurred vision, bone pain, fatigue and headaches.
The best way of obtaining a healthy balance of vitamins is by eating
a large variety of different foods. One should try not to limit their
diet to a few delicacies. Try out new dishes, be adventurous.
Fat-Soluble Vitamins. The fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins
A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are absorbed, transported, metabolized
and stored along with fat. The fat soluble vitamins function as
regulators for specific metabolic activity.
Water-soluble Vitamins. The water-soluble vitamins include
vitamin C, and those of the B-complex group: biotin, folate, niacin,
pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. They function mainly as coenzymes.
Vitamin Supplements
No data have yet been published to demonstrate that healthy people eating a well balanced diet need any vitamin supplements.
A well balanced diet means that what one has eaten during the day
should include a wide variety of foods from each of the five food
groups (fruit, vegetables, bread and grains, meat and milk).
Except in pregnancy, where supplementation of certain vitamins may
be recommended, there are no reports of normal persons eating a well
balanced diet developing vitamin deficiency diseases. The proper role
of vitamin supplementation is in the treatment of deficiency in
patients who have inadequate intake, disturbed absorption, or increased
requirements because of an increased destruction or excretion.
Mega-dose therapy is the treatment with daily quantities of a vitamin or vitamins substantially above the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)
of the Food and Nutrition Board. The RDAs are the levels of intake of
essential nutrients considered to be adequate to meet the known
nutritional needs of all healthy persons.
Vitamins, like many other substances, may be toxic when taken in
large quantities. Large doses of nicotinic acid frequently cause
flushing and itching, liver damage, dermatoses, elevations of serum
glucose concentration and peptic ulceration may occur. Prolonged
excessive intake of vitamin D can cause anorexia, nausea, weakness,
weight loss, hypertension, anemia, hypercalcemia, irreversible renal
failure, and death. Vitamin E in large doses antagonises the action of
vitamin A and also causes headaches, nausea, fatigue, blurred vision,
inflammation of the mouth, chapping of the lips, gastrointestinal
disturbances, muscle weakness, low blood sugar, increased bleeding
tendency, and degenerative changes.
The comments that vitamin doses in excess of the RDA may produce
""optimal"" health are pure speculation, unsupported by any facts in
human metabolism, and contradicted by the toxicity of vitamin and
mineral doses in excess of the RDA. ""More is better"" is a slogan, not
science. More is sometimes better, sometimes worse, but always costlier.
Vitamin A (Retinol, Carotene)
Vitamin A is fat soluble, it is an antioxidant and occurs in two forms - retinol and carotene. The RDA [Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council - Recommended Dietaty Allowances. ] for adults is 1000 micrograms RE (Retinol Equivalents. 1 RE = 1 microgram retinol or 6 micrograms ?-carotene).
The allowances, expressed as average daily intakes over time, are
intended to provide for individual variations among most normal persons
as they live in the United States under usual environment stresses. The
RDA's given are the higher of adult males or females, for more precise
data refer to the RDA tables.
Because vitamin A and carotene exist in more than one chemical form,
and because they are not equally active, it is usual to give the name
retinol to the pure vitamin A. Thus the total vitamin A activity of a
food, its retinol equivalent, is determined by how much it contains of
retinol, chemicals very similar to retinol but not as active, and a
range of carotenes also of varying activity.
Vitamin A maintains the skin and mucous membranes. Promotes growth,
strong bones, healthy skin, hair, teeth and gums. Builds up resistance
to respiratory infections and shortens the duration of diseases. It
counteracts night blindness and aids in the treatment of many eye
disorders. Night blindness is an early symptom of a deficiency of
vitamin A.
In a dozen case-control and cohort studies, intakes of fruits and
vegetables containing carotenoids has been associated with a reduced
risk of lung cancer. In contrast little relationship has been found
between intake of preformed vitamin A (retinol) and this disease.
Available data thus strongly support the hypothesis that dietary
carotenoids reduce the risk of lung cancer, but the data also are
compatible with the possibility that some other factor in these foods
is responsible for the lower risk. The recommendation to eat a variety
of fruits and vegetables is reasonable, but leaves much to chance; if
?-carotene is the anticancer agent, intake of specific fruits and
vegetables should be advised. [Willett, W.C., Vitamin A and lung cancer , Nutrition Reviews, 48:201, 1990]
The best natural sources are green leafy vegetable tops, carrots,
red peppers, sweet potatoes, yellow fruits, apricots, fish-liver oil
and eggs.
Vitamin A is one of the few vitamins in which excess produces
definite and severe effects. Toxic symptoms can occur with intake
exceeding 100 000 IU's daily. Hypervitaminosis A leads to loss of
appetite, a dry, itchy skin often with peeling, intense headaches and
an enlarged liver. Recovery is fairly rapid when intake is reduced.
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)
Vitamin B1 is water soluble like all the B vitamins. It is easily lost and must be replaced daily. The RDA for adults is 1.5 milligrams.
Thiamine prevents and cures beriberi, a disease of the nervous
system. It aids growth, maintains normal carbohydrate metabolism and
nervous system functioning. It helps alleviate stress conditions,
anxiety and trauma.
The best natural sources are dried yeast, spirulina, whole wheat, oats, peanuts, soybeans, green vegetables and milk.
This vitamin is not toxic, it is easily excreted from the body and
not stored. It is destroyed by heat, caffeine, alcohol and cigarette
smoke.
Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)
Vitamin B2 is not stored and must be replaced daily. The RDA for adults is 1.7 milligrams.
Essential for normal cell growth, helps to metabolize carbohydrates,
fats and proteins. Benefits vision and eye fatigue, promotes healthy
skin, nails and hair. Eliminates sores in mouth, on lips and tongue.
The best natural sources are milk, yeast, cheese, sea vegetables, leafy green vegetables, mushrooms, fish and eggs.
There are no known toxic effects. It is destroyed by light, alcohol and sulfur drugs.
Vitamin B3 (Niacin, Nicotinic Acid)
Niacin is a component of an enzyme and can be produced by the
body, some of the amino acid tryptophane is converted into niacin. The
RDA for adults is 19 milligrams.
It is necessary for a wide variety of body processes, reduces high blood pressure,
lowers cholesterol levels and prevents pellagra. Without niacin, thiamine and riboflavin cannot function properly.
The best natural sources are lean meat, whole wheat, tuna, anchovy, yeast, eggs, peanuts and avocados.
Niacin is not toxic but people with peptic ulcers or diabetes should
consult a doctor before taking supplements greater than 100 milligrams.
Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)
Vitamin B5 is known in other forms - Calcium Pantothenate and Panthenol. The RDA for adults is 7 milligrams.
It is necessary for the utilization of other nutrients and
maintaining normal growth and development of the nervous system, as
well as for the metabolism of fat and sugars.
The best natural sources are fish, whole grains, wheat germ, green vegetables and brewers yeast.
There are few known toxic effects, but very large doses have been
known to produce lack of co-ordination in movement and impairment of
sensation. It is destroyed by heat, caffeine and alcohol.
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)
B6 has three metabolic forms pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. The RDA for adults is 2.0 milligrams.
It is essential in amino acid metabolism, is required for the absorption of B12 and for the production of antibodies and red blood cells.
The best natural sources are bananas, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, green and red peppers, nuts, molasses and eggs.
Intake should be increased with diets high in protein. Daily doses
of over 500 mg should be avoided. Doses over 2 g can lead to
neurological disorders. Food processing techniques, canning and alcohol
can deplete vitamin B6.
Vitamin B12 (Cyancobalimin, Cobalamin)
B12 contains mineral elements - cobalt. The RDA for adults is 2.0 micrograms.
Cobalamins are necessary for protein
and fatty acid metabolism and the production of red blood cells. It
maintains a healthy nervous system and improves concentration and
memory.
The best natural sources are clams, oysters, beef, eggs and dairy products.
It is not found in many plant products except certain soya products,
tempeh and sea vegetables. If you are a strict vegetarian you will need
to take B12 supplements. Although, people who have diets high in protein need more B12. A deficiency can cause pernicious anemia.
B12 is not easily absorbed and needs to be combined with
calcium for proper absorption. It is destroyed by sunlight, alcohol and
sleeping pills. There have been no reports of B12 toxicity.
Vitamin B15 (Pangamic Acid, Pangamate, Calcium Pangamate)
Pangamic acid has not had much research done on it in the USA, but
has been approved in Russia and used by athletes to enhance
performance. Pangamic acid is a label not a product. The pills contain
anything the seller chooses to put in them.
The Food and Drug Administration contend that ""B15"" is
essentially an untested food additive which is not generally recognized
by the scientific experts as safe for human consumption. Pangamate was
prohibited within Canada for almost two decades. Because of these
facts, any physician who prescribes it should first get informed
consent from his or her patients after informing them that it is not a
vitamin, has no known nutrient value, no known value in the long-term
treatment of any disease, that its safety has not been established, and
that it may be mutagenic (cancer causing).
The allegations that pangamic acid is an antioxidant, protects
against pollutants, increases the life span of cells, relieves symptoms
of asthma and lowers blood cholesterol levels, as well as that it stops
the craving for alcohol and protects the liver from cirrhosis are
anecdotal and testimonial stories rather than studies.
The authors often claim spectacular results from ""pangamic acid""
without identifying which of the many chemicals and chemical
combinations which go by that name they are using. Without
distinguishing drug effect from the placebo, and without reporting any
evaluation of patients for short-term or long-term toxic effects. [Herbert, J., (Chief Hematology & Nutr. Lab. Bronx VA Medical Center) : Nutrition Cultism - Facts & Fictions. 1981]
Vitamin B17 (Laetrile)
Laetrile is the trademark of a compound of two parts glucose and one part cyanide. There is no vitamin B17, ""B17""
is a tradename created for laetrile by a laetrile proponent. It is
naturally present in the kernels of apricot pits and a number of other
stone fruits and nuts. There is no RDA but doses vary from 0.25 g to
1.0 g a day.
It is believed to have cancer controlling and preventative
properties. Apparently normal cells can tolerate small quantities of
cyanide but cancer cells succumb to it.
Cyanide has no value in sustaining human life. In small amounts it
injures, in larger amounts it kills. No law prevents promoters from
trade-naming nutritionally worthless or poisonous substances.
Cyanide is rapidly absorbed from the intestine and diffuses
throughout the body, knocking out respiration in cells. Eating about 25
apricot kernels can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, a
sharp fall in blood pressure, breathing difficulties, coma and death.
There have been documented cases of people dying after taking as few
as five laetrile tablets. Not more than 1.0 gram should be taken at any
one time. [Herbert, J., (Chief Hematology & Nutr. Lab. Bronx VA Medical Center) : Nutrition Cultism - Facts & Fictions. 1981]
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
Ascorbic acid is water soluble and is easily lost from the body. The RDA for adults is 60 milligrams.
It is important for the growth and repair of body tissue cells,
bones, gums and teeth. It fights bacterial infections, protects Vitamin
A, some of the B vitamins and vitamin E from oxidation and is necessary
for the use of iron and oxygen in the body. People who lack this
vitamin may have sore gums and bleeding under the skin.
It helps to reduce blood cholesterol levels, aids in preventing bacterial and viral infections, and prevents and cures scurvy.
The best natural sources are citrus fruits, hot chili peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, green leafy vegetables, and sweet potatoes.
Vitamin C is non toxic but people with peptic ulcers, might
hemorrhage and should consult a doctor before taking supplements. It is
lost through water, destroyed by cooking, heat, light and smoking.
Vitamin D (Calciferol)
Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin and can be produced in the skin with
exposure to sunlight. The RDA for adults is 10 micrograms or 400 IU.
(as cholecalciferol. 10 micrograms cholecalciferol = 400 IU of vitamin
D.]
It regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism. Aids the assimilation
of vitamin A and helps the treatment of conjuctivites and rickets.
The best natural sources are sardines, herring and dairy products.
It is produced by interaction with sunlight and oils (cholesterol) in
the skin.
It can be toxic with doses of over 5000 IU daily. In smog conditions
or when activities reduce exposure to sunlight vitamin D intake should
be increased.
Vitamin E (Tocopherol)
Vitamin E is the term used for eight naturally occurring,
fat-soluble nutrients called tocopherols - alpha, beta, gamma, delta,
epsilon, zeta, eta and theta. Alpha-Tocopherol is essential, has the
highest biological activity, and predominates in many species. The RDA
for adults is 10 IU. (Designated according to its biological activity
in International Units (IU). With this vitamin 1 IU = 1 mg Alpha
Tocopherol Equivalents).
In human beings, vitamin E is the most important fat-soluble
antioxidant. It prevents the potentially harmful oxidation of fat
compounds and enhances the functioning of vitamin A. It is an
antipollutant for the lungs. It helps the healing of scar tissue when
taken internally and also when applied externally.
The best natural sources are wheat germ, whole grains, vegetable oils, soya beans, nuts, apples, apricots and green vegetables.
Vitamin E deficiency may cause anemia, as a result of red blood cell
destruction and neurological dysfunction, myopathies, and diminished
erythrocyte life span. New clinical evidence from heavy drinkers
suggests that alcohol may increase oxidation of Alpha-Tocopherol.
Increased demand has also been observed in premature infants and
patients with malabsorption.
It is generally non toxic but some evidence suggests that large
intakes may cause increased levels of blood cholesterol and lipids. It
can oxidize within a few months of being manufactured, so supplements
should not be stored for more than a few months. It is destroyed by
heat, freezing, food processing, chlorine and iron.
Vitamin K (Menadione)
Vitamin K is a fat soluble vitamin usually formed in the body by intestinal bacteria but also available from some plant and animal sources. The RDA for adult males is 80 micrograms.
Its primary function is to control the rate of blood clotting and prevent internal bleeding.
The best natural sources are all leafy green vegetables,
cauliflower, brussel sprouts, broccoli, soybean oil, kelp, cereal grain
products, fruits and yoghurt.
Vitamin K deficiency has been reported in patients treated with
antibiotics and placed on poor diets after surgery. A deficiency can
cause bleeding disorders. Doctors sometimes give women vitamin K before
childbirth to prevent bleeding in the newborn baby. Babies do not have
enough intestinal bacteria to produce adequate amounts of the vitamin
until they are about 2 weeks old.
No toxicity symptoms have been recorded from natural forms but
supplementation of synthetic vitamin K exceeding 500 mcg is not
recommended as it can cause anemia and kernicterus, a condition
characterized by jaundice.
Biotin
Biotin is a member of the B complex family and is water soluble. The RDA for adults is 100 micrograms.
It is essential for the metabolism of fats and the synthesis of
ascorbic acid. It maintains a healthy skin and helps prevent baldness
and hair from turning grey.
The best natural sources are soya beans, brown rice, nuts, fruit,
brewer's yeast and milk. It can be synthesized by intestinal bacteria.
It is not toxic. Avidin, a substance found in egg white prevents
biotin absorption. Sulfur drugs, food processing and alcohol destroy
biotin.
Choline
Choline is a cofactor of the B vitamins. There is no RDA but the
average adult diet contains between 500 milligrams to 900 milligrams a
day.
Choline exists in combination with phospholipids which make up part
of the brain and spinal cord tissue. These compounds are called
lecithins. It is essential for growth and is involved in fat transport
and in carbohydrate and protein metabolism. It participates in the
metabolism of fat and emulsifies cholesterol, helping to control the
build up in arteries. It aids in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
and helps to remove drugs and poisons from your system. It is also the
precursor of acetylcholine, which is involved in the transmission of
nerveimpulses. It is crucial for normal brain functioning and memory.
It goes directly into the brain cells and produces a chemical that aids
memory.
The best natural sources are soya lecithin, green leafy vegetables, yeast and wheat germ.
There is no known toxicity. It is destroyed by sulfur drugs, food processing and alcohol.
Folic Acid (Folate, Folacin)
Folic acid is a cofactor of the B complex vitamins. The RDA for adults is 200 micrograms.
Folate is essential for cell growth because of its involvement in
nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and for the formation of red blood
cells and protein metabolism. It protects the body against intestinal
parasites and food poisoning. Maintains a healthy skin and helps in the
treatment of anemia.
Megaloblastic anemia caused by folate deficiency is a major problem
in world health, especially among pregnant women and patients with
malabsorption or alcoholism.
The best natural sources are raw leafy vegetables, fruit, carrots,
torula yeast, avocados, beans and whole wheat. Consumption of fresh
fruit and green leafy vegetables daily will ensure against dietary
folate deficiency.
In doses of up to 5 mg a day there has been no sign of toxicity.
It is easily lost in boiling water, sunlight, food processing, heat
and by taking sulfur drugs. A heavy drinker also needs to increase
folic acid intake.
Inositol
Inositol is a cofactor of the B complex vitamins. There is no RDA but the average adult gets about 1 gram per day in their diet.
It works with choline in the metabolism of fat and cholesterol. It
is essential for the proper conduction of nerve impulses, lowers
cholesterol levels, promotes healthy hair and prevents balding.
The best natural sources are lecithin, brewer's yeast, lima beans,
peanuts, raisins, wheat germ, cabbage, cantaloupe, grapefruit and
molasses.
It is not toxic but is destroyed by sulfur drugs, food processing, alcohol and coffee.
PABA (Para-aminobenzoic Acid)
PABA is another member of the B complex family of vitamins. There is
no RDA but about 100 milligrams is usually included in B complex
supplements.
It helps in the assimilation of protein and pantothenic acid. It is
important for normal skin and hair growth. It can protect you against
sunburn, prevent wrinkles, reduce the pain of burns and restore grey
hair to its natural color.
The best natural sources are whole grains, wheat germ, brewer's yeast, rice and molasses.
Non toxic, but high doses over a long period of time may cause nausea and vomiting.

Vitamin B17 As a
Preventative
Vitamin B-17 is one
of the main sources of food in cultures such as the Eskimos, the Hunzas, the
Abkasians and many more. Did you know that within these tribes there has never
been a reported case of cancer? According to Dr. Krebs, we need a minimum
of 100 mg of vitamin B-17 (the equivalent of about seven apricots seeds) too
nearly guarantee a cancer free life. Foods that contain vitamin B-17 are as
follows:
KERNELS OR SEEDS
OF FRUIT: The highest concentration of vitamin B-17 to be found in nature,
aside from bitter almonds. Apple, apricot, cherry, nectarine, peach, pear,
plum, prune.
BEANS: broad (Vicia
faba), burma, chickpeas, lentils (sprouted), lima, mung (sprouted), Rangoon,
scarlet runner.
NUTS: Bitter almond,
macadamia, cashew.
BERRIES: Almost
all wild berries. Blackberry, chokeberry, Christmas berry, cranberry, elderberry,
raspberry, strawberry.
SEEDS: Chia, flax,
sesame.
GRASSES: Acacia,
alfalfa (sprouted), aquatic, Johnson, milkweed, Sudan, minus, wheat grass,
white dover.
GRAINS: oat groats,
barley, brown rice, buckwheat groats, chia, flax, millet, rye, vetch, wheat
berries.
MISCELLANEOUS: bamboo
shoots, fuschia plant, sorghum, wild hydrangea, yew tree (needles, fresh
leaves).
Two rules of thumb:
According to Dr. Krebs, the basic concept is that sufficient daily B-17 may
be obtained by following either of two suggestions:
First, eating all
the B-17-containing fruits whole (seeds included), but not eating more of
the seeds by themselves than you would be eating if you ate them in the whole
fruit. Example: if you eat three apples a day, the seeds in the three apples
are sufficient B-17. You would not eat a pound of apple seeds.
Second, one peach
or apricot kernel per 10 lbs of body weight is believed to be more than sufficient
as a normal safeguard in cancer prevention, although precise numbers may vary
from person to person in accordance with individual metabolism and dietary
habits. A 170-lb man, for example, might consume 17 apricot or peach kernels
per day and receive a biologically reasonable amount of Vitamin B-17.
And two important
notes: Certainly, you can consume too much of anything. Too many kernels or
seeds, for example, can be expected to produce unpleasant side effects. These
natural foods should be consumed in biologically rational amounts (no more
than 30 to 35 kernels per day).
High concentrations
of B-17 are obtained by eating the natural foods in their raw or sprouting
stage. This does not mean that moderate cooking and other tampering will destroy
the B-17 content. Foods cooked at a temperature sufficient for a Chinese dinner,
for example, will not lose their B-17 content.

Herbal Medicine and Cancer
By Ming-Yee Pang
9/18/2006
Cancer is the second most
common cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS)
estimates that half the men and one-third of the women in the United States will develop cancer in their lifetimes. The ACS also estimates that about 1.4
million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2006, and about 565,000 people
will die of the disease. (http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2006PWSecured.pdf)
Of these new patients, more than 50% will participate in some forms of
alternative therapy. One of the most common alternative therapies for cancer is
herbal medicine. A national survey found that 14% of all people in the United States are using herbal medicine, yet more than 70% of these people do not tell
their physicians about what they are taking. (http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/diet/fs53.herbal.cfm)
This figure is worrisome because the safety and effectiveness of herbal
medicine is still not fully understood.
Origins of
Herbal Medicine
Herbal medicine is
extracted from plants for use in the treatment of disease and certain
medical conditions. It is the world�s most ancient form of medicine. Its
use of plants for healing purposes dates all the way back to ancient
times. For example, Chinese herbs have been used for centuries. Despite
its long history, more than 80% of the world�s population today,
especially those in developing countries, still rely on herbal medicine. (http://www.surgerydoor.co.uk/level2/complementarymedicine_herbalmedicine.shtml)
Many conventional drugs that are available today also originate from plant
sources. For example, aspirin is derived from willow bark (Vickers, &
Zollman, 1999). �����������������������������������������������������������
How Does Herbal
Medicine Work?
Herbal medicine treats
the whole person rather than individual symptoms. Herbal practitioners
often see the underlying cause of an illness in terms of balance. For
example, Chinese herbal medicine is based on the concepts of yin and yang.
A person�s illness indicates the body�s imbalance of yin and yang forces.
Hence, targeted at excess or deficiency in either yin or yang in an
individual, Chinese herbs are used, often in combination, to restore the
balance of these two life forces. (http://www.tcmbasics.com/basics_yinyang.htm)
Thus, herbal medicine is intended to reestablish harmony and balance in a
person�s body because an imbalance in the body could lead to many
illnesses. As a treatment for cancer, herbal medicine aims to bring the
body back to a balanced state by strengthening its immune system. When the
body is strong, it can fight against cancer, and thereby heal itself. This
is different from traditional medicine which targets at removing the tumor
through surgical procedures, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. (http://www.acupuncture.com/herbs/cancerherb.htm)
Herbal medicine also
emphasizes on the principle of synergy, which is the idea that combining
two or more herbs together can produce a greater effect than using only
one single herb. In addition, while one herb can help another work better,
it can also reduce or eliminate side effects of another herb. Such
property is known as the �buffering� effect. As a result, unlike
conventional drugs that only contain a single active chemical, herbal
remedies often contain many different ingredients. Below are some of the
Chinese herbs that are often used in combination as a treatment for cancer
listed on a world-wide web - http://www.herbsforcancer.com/herbs.html:

In addition, herbs may be used
as an adjunctive treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are
the two most common treatments for cancer in conventional medicine.
Chemotherapy is treatment of cancer with drugs that destroy cancer cells.
However, since chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not
specific for cancer cells, they can harm healthy tissue as well. There are also
many side effects when undergoing chemotherapy, including nausea, fatigue, hair
loss, etc. Thus, chemotherapy could be very harsh on the patient�s body. Likewise,
radiation therapy is hard on the body as well. Using radiation to kill cancer
cells, radiation sometimes also damages normal cells. Moreover, patients who
are undergoing radiation therapy suffer from tremendous hair loss and other side
effects. As a result, herbs may be used as a supplemental treatment to offset
the damaging side-effects of conventional cancer treatments. They may also be
used to strengthen the patient�s immune system which is often weaken by the ongoing
and invasive radiation therapy and chemotherapy. (http://www.acupuncture.com/herbs/cancerherb.htm)
Common
Types of Herbal Medicine
Herbs can be used fresh,
dried, or as alcohol or water extracts. The most common forms available include
teas, tinctures, extracts, capsules/tablets, powders, and ointments.
�
Teas ���������������������������������������������������������
Herbal medicine is
traditionally taken in tea form. It is thought that human body absorbs tea
easily and quickly so it is the most commonly used method. Teas are generally
prepared by boiling the leaves, roots, and flowers of a medicinal plant in hot
water.
�
Tinctures
In a tincture,
alcohol is used to extract the active ingredients of an herb. Alcohol is also a
very effective natural preservative. Thus, tincture can be stored for a long
period of time. Tinctures are concentrated and cost-effective.
�
Extracts
Extracts usually
come in a liquid form, but solid extracts are also available. They can be made
with either alcohol or water. They are the most concentrated form of herbal
treatment, but have a stronger herbal taste.
�
Capsules and Tablets������������
����������������������������������������������������
Herbs are dried
and grinded into powders. Then, powders are compressed or put in an empty pill
coating to form capsules and tablets. They tend to be less strong and potent
than tinctures and extracts. However, they often contain a standard level of
active components.
�
Ointments
Herbs
can also be made into ointments for topical use.
Why Do People Take Herbal
Medicine?
�
People who take herbal medicine
generally believe that herbs are natural; therefore they must be harmless
(Brigden, 1995).
�
Another myth is that chemicals
produced in nature are better than the same products synthesized in chemical
laboratories (Brigden, 1995).
�
Herbal medicine has a much lower
cost than conventional drugs and other medical procedures. Therefore, herbal
medicine attracts patients with poor medical insurance coverage
(Spaulding-Albright, 1997).
�
People with terminal diseases
are also more willing to take herbal medicine or engage in other alternative
treatments that can provide them with a possibility of improving quality and
quantity of life (Spaulding-Albright, 1997).
�
There is a growing distrust in
traditional medicine and physicians. In conventional medicine, physicians
generally focus on treating the symptoms of illnesses Such approach often makes
patients feel that they are being treated as a non-person, and that they do not
have control over their health conditions. Some patients might thereby look for
a more holistic approach, such as herbal medicine, which treats patients as a
whole person. It also provides patients with a sense of control over their
disease processes (Spaulding-Albright, 1997).
Evidences
on Some of the Herbal Treatments for Cancer:
�
PC-SPES
Claim:
To treat prostate cancer
Research evidence:
PC-SPES
is a recently developed herbal supplement for the treatment for prostate
cancer. It consists of eight different plant extract. A number of Phase II
studies have been conducted on PC-SPES. The largest and most
carefully-controlled study to date is a Phase II trial of PC-SPES in 70
patients with advanced prostate cancer: 33 patients with androgen-dependent
prostate cancer and 37 patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (Small,
E. J., Frohlich, M. W., Bok, R., Shinohara, K., Grossfield, G., Rozenblat, Z.,
Kelly, W. K., Corry, M., & Reese, D. M., 2000). All participants were not
allowed to receive any new therapy within 30 days of study entry, including the
use of chemotherapy, hormonal agents, therapeutic agents, and herbal
supplements. Patients first received 320-mg capsules for one week. Of there
were no adverse reactions to the capsules, the dose was increased to 640-mg for
a week, and then to the maximum dose of 960-mg, which was equivalent to 9
capsules daily. The goals of this study were to examine the effect of PC-SPES
on Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in cancer patients, as well as the
toxicity of PC-SPES. Clinical outcome was assessed with PSA level measurement
and imaging studies. A response was defined as a reduction PSA levels greater
than 50% from baseline. All 32 patients with androgen-dependent prostate cancer
experienced PSA declines of greater than 80%; no patient had developed PSA
progression 64 weeks after treatment. Over half of the patients with
androgen-independent prostate cancer had a PSA decline of greater than 50%;
they developed PSA progression in a median time of 16 weeks. Although drop in
PSA levels was a good sign, imaging studies (positive bone scans) showed that
only 2 patients had tumor shrinkage. This indicated that PC-SPES was not an
effective cancer treatment. In addition, Small and his colleagues (2000) found
that PC-SPES was associated with a number of endocrine-side effects. All
patients reported a decrease in sex drive on therapy. 15 patients who could
achieve erection before therapy lost the ability to do so. PC-SPES also led to
the abnormal enlargement of breasts in all patients and hot flashes in about
one-third of patients.
Although
several clinical trials showed that PC-SPES could lower PSA levels, none showed
that it could shrink prostate tumors or prolong survival in men with prostate
cancer. In addition, PC-SPES was taken off the market because of
contamination in 2002. (http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Herbal_Prostate_Cancer_Treatment_PC-SPES_Not_All_Natural.asp)

Huanglian������
Some
of it claims:
o
To treat cancer
o
To treat bacterial and viral
infections
o
To treat respiratory and ear
infections
o
To treat gastrointestinal
problems
Research
evidence on its efficacy as a cancer treatment:
Huanglian,
also known as Coptis chinensis, is an herb that is widely used in China for inflammatory conditions and gastroenteritis. Its anti-cancer activity has been
demonstrated in previous studies. To further examine its role as an anti-cancer
agent, Li, X-K., Motwani, M., Tong, W., Bornmann, W., & Schwartz, G. K.
(2000) conducted an in-vitro study on Huanglian�s effects on tumor cell growth.
In this study, human gastric cancer cell lines, breast cancer cell lines, as
well as colon cancer cell lines were cultured using standard protocol. Cell
cultures were randomly plated onto 6-well plates and treated with drug free
media (control), or media containing 1, 10, or 100ug.ml of huanglian for five
days. Cell density was measured at day 0 (without huanglian) and at each of the
following five days. Li et al. (2000) found that huanglian completely inhibited
the growth of gastric, breast, and colon cancer cell lines after 3 consecutive
days of exposure of 10ug/ml of huanglian. The effect of hunaglian on tumor cell
growth was associated with selective suppression of cyclin B1 protein, which
resulted in the inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity � a target for cancer
chemotherapy (Li, Motwani, Tong, Bornmann, & Schwartz, 2000).
Despite
encouraging results, in-vitro could not accurately reflect the safety and
efficacy of herbal medicine in human bodies. Hence, a well-controlled clinical
trial is required to study the effects of huanglian on human body, as well as
any adverse effect associated with the use of huanglian. In fact, a Phase I of
huanglian on tumor is currently underway at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/69259.cfm).
Baikal Skullcap
Some
of its claims:
To
treat cancer
To
treat other medical conditions, including atherosclerosis, epilepsy,
hepatitis, infections, inflammation, and insomnia
Research
evidence on its efficacy as a cancer treatment:
Baikal skullcap, also known as Scutellaria
Baicalensis, is derived from the root of the plant. The herb has been used in
traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of conditions. The flavonoid
components of Baikal skullcap are thought responsible for its anti-cancer
activity. An in-vitro study was conducted by Scheck, Perry, Hank, & Clark (2006) to study the anti-cancer effects of Baikal skullcap. In this study, cell lines
grown from primary and recurrent brain tumors from three patients were
cultured. Cells that were resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent 1,3-bis
(2-chloroethyl)-1 nitrosourea (BCNU) were used to identify effects of Baikal
skullcap when used alone and in conjunction with BCNU: They were treated with
either 2.5 ug/ml of BCNU alone, 50ug/ml of Baikal skullcap alone, or a
combination of both. Cells were treated for 3 consecutive days. Results were
compared to control (untreated) cells. The results of this study showed that the
anticancer activity of Baikal skullcap was evident as it inhibited cell growth
in all brain tumor cell lines; it also increased its inhibitory effect when
used in conjunction with BCNU. �Hence, results of this study support the
efficacy of Baikal skullcap as an anticancer agent for brain tumors, and also
as a potential supplementary treatment to current chemotherapeutic drugs, such
as BCNU, in treating brain tumors (Scheck, Perry, Hank, & Clark, 2006).
Nonetheless,
Baikal skullcap has not been studied in clinical trials as a single agent.
Thus, it must be used with caution.
Astragalus
Some
of its claims:
To stimulate immune
system
To reduce the severity
of chemotherapy side effects, including immune suppression
To fight bacterial
infections
To prevent and treat
heart disease
To treat other medical
conditions, including common cold, diabetes, as well as HIV and AIDS.
Research
evidence on its efficacy as a cancer treatment:
Astragalus,
also known as Huang chi, has been widely used in China to stimulate the immune
system. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Center conducted an
in-vitro study in which they found that Astragalus improved the immune system
in 13 cancer patients by 260% compared with untreated cells and by 160%
compared with cells from healthy controls. In spite of this promising result,
other studies showed that Astragalus could cause low blood pressures,
dizziness, and fatigue; overdoses could even damage the immune system (Chu,
Wong, & Mavlight, 1988, cited in Spaulding-Albright, 1997).
In
a clinical trial that was designed to test whether Astragalus had an effect on
human immune system, 31 patients with end-stage kidney diseases were randomized
into two groups: the treatment group received Astragalus extract for two months,
and the other group received a placebo for two months. Compared to the placebo
group, the Astragalus group had significantly higher levels of IL-2, a
substance that stimulates the growth of immune cells and their response to
disease. However, this study did not address whether Astragalus helped patients
to fight off cancer or prolonged patients� lives (Qun, Luo, Zhang, Chen, Zhang,
Lin, 1999)
Essiac
Some of its claims:
To treat cancer
To stimulate the immune
system
To treat HIV and AIDS
Research
evidence of its efficacy as a cancer treatment:
Herbal
tea Essiac has been promoted as a cure for all cancers since 1992, but there is
very little evidence to support its efficacy as a cancer treatment. In
laboratory experiments, rhubarb, one of the constituents in Essiac, was
demonstrated to cause tumor death in mice, but these effects have not been
shown in humans in the United States, In a Canadian study of 77 cancer patients
taking the herbal treatment, only eight improved their conditions; 17 died; 47
showed no effects. On the follow-up of the eight patients who showed improved
conditions, three of them developed tumor progression, two of them died, and
three remained stable. (US Government Printing Office, 1990, cited in
Spaulding-Albright, 1997)
Laetrile
Claim:
To treat cancer
Research
Evidence:
Found
in the seeds of apricots, peaches, and plums, Laetrile gained its popularity as
an alternative cancer treatment. Nonetheless, in a clinical trial, 178 cancer
patients were treated with amygdalin (Laetrile). None of the patients were in
preterminal condition before the study, and one-third of them had not received
any prior treatment. Patients were received amygdalin treatment three times a
day for 21 days. In addition, patients were placed on a metabolic therapy
consisting of diet, vitamins, minerals, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation.
Of all patients, there was only one partial response, 79% developed cancer
progression after two months and 91% by three months. Median survival was 4.8
months from initiation of therapy. In fact, 85% of the participants died within
8 months from the start of the study. Many adverse effects were also detected,
including cyanide toxicity, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and mental
obtundation. The results suggest that amygdalin is ineffective in the treatment
of cancer. (Moertel, Fleming, Rubin,
Kvols, Sarna, Koch, Currie, Young, Jones, & Davignon, 1982)
Mistletoe
Some of its claims:
To treat cancer
To stimulate immune
system
To lower high blood
pressure
To treat arthritis,
hepatitis, HIV and AIDS
Research
evidence on its efficacy as a cancer treatment:
There
has been a fair amount of randomized clinical trials done on mistletoe in Europe. In order to investigate whether or not these clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy
of mistletoe as a cancer therapy, Ernst, Schmidt, & Steuer-Vogt (2003)
conducted a systematic review of these trials. In reviewing ten controlled
clinical trials, researchers found that most of them were poorly designed.
While some of the weaker studies reported benefits of mistletoe in treating
cancer, all of the rigorous studies with stronger methodology and designs
failed to demonstrate efficacy of mistletoe therapy.
For
example, in one of the clinical trials reviewed, Douwes and colleagues (1986)
randomized 60 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma into three groups:
Group A was treated with chemotherapy only; Group B was treated with both
chemotherapy and mistletoe extracts; Group C was treated with chemotherapy and
xenogenic peptides (cited in Ernst, Schmidt, & Steuer-Vogt, 2003).
Researchers found that the mean survival time in groups A and B were about
twice that of group C. However, this trial was not patient-blinded. In
addition, the amount of xenogenic peptides injected, as well as the number of
chemotherapy cycles given to each group, were not reported. Hence, no sound
conclusion could be drawn from this study.
In
another clinical trial, Salzer et al. (1991) randomized 218 patients with
bronchial cancer into two groups: Group A received mistletoe extracts and group
B received no extracts (cited in Ernst, Schmidt, & Steuer-Vogt, 2003). Both
groups received conventional treatments. Although the author stated that
efficacy of Mistletoe in treatment of cancer was clinically significant,
results from this study was not statistically significant. In addition, this
report provided little details on the methods used in this study.
In
a more rigorous trial, Steuer-Vogt and colleagues (2001) studied a total of 477
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Patients in the
experimental group received injections of a mistletoe extract twice a week for
12 weeks, and then patients received no mistletoe for 4 weeks (cited in Ernst,
Schmidt, & Steuer-Vogt, 2003). Three of the same cycles were given in
total. Researchers found that the use of mistletoe had no effect in the
treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Ernst, Schmidt, &
Steuer-Vogt (2003) stated that this was the most rigorous study evaluated in
this systematic review. Nonetheless, it was neither placebo-controlled nor
double-blind.
Overall,
most of the clinical trials studying the effectiveness of mistletoe as a cancer
treatment have been poorly designed or lack a placebo group. Therefore, it is
still uncertain whether mistletoe works.
Are Herbal
Medicine Safe?
As mentioned before, many
people perceive herbal medicine as safe because of its natural appeal.
Nevertheless, that is just a myth. Almost all herbal medicines used in the United States are classified as �dietary supplements�. Hence, there is no strict regulation
on herbal medicine. For instance, manufacturers are not required to demonstrate
either the effectiveness or the safety of herbal medicines before they are
sold. If an herbal medicine is unsafe, it is the job of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to prove this claim. Therefore, herbal medicine is less
regulated than conventional medicine (Spaulding-Albright, 1997)
Problems with herbal
medicine include:
1. Since herbal
preparations are not strictly regulated, the quality and quantity of active
ingredients in an herbal product might vary between manufacturers.
2. Herbal medicine maybe
contaminated or adulterated. In Belgium, Aristolochia fangchi was misidentified
as Stephania tetrandra. Patients who were given Aristolochia fangchi as a
weight loss supplement developed severe kidney failure (Gottlieb, 2000).
3. Herbal remedies can
interact with other pharmaceutical products, such as anticancer drugs. They can
also hinder or interfere with the effects of other conventional treatments.
4. Life-threatening side
effects are occasionally associated with used of herbs. For example, Ephedra,
also known as Ma huang, was banned by the FDA due to reports of severe adverse
effects, including stroke and death (http://nccam.nih.gov/health/alerts/ephedra/consumeradvisory.htm).
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the effectiveness of herbal medicine as
a treatment for cancer is not well-understood yet. Although many world-wide
websites claim the efficacy of herbal medicine as a cancer treatment, there is
a lack of strong evidence from clinical trials. Without consistent evidences that
come from well-designed, carefully-controlled, randomized, double-blind,
clinical trials, it is very difficult to assess the safety and efficacy of
herbal medicine. Therefore, cancer patients should be careful when they choose
to use herbal medicine. They should also inform their health care providers
about all of the herbal medicines they are taking in case these medicines might
interact with other cancer treatments. Meanwhile, researchers should continue
to conduct properly controlled clinical trial to examine the safety and
efficacy of herbal medicine as a potential cancer therapy.

Have you ever wondered why 100 years ago cancer was a rare disease but today, There are many kinds of cancer and it is estimated 1 out of 4 people will get cancer in their life! The answers for all cancer are here on this site! This is not just someone's opinion about cancer but, facts that have been proven in scientific labs, by doctors and, the most important test is from the people that have cured cancer from their own bodies !!! The answer to cancer has been known for many years! Vitamin B17 was the subject of great controversy over 20 years ago when some of the world's top scientists claimed that when consumed, the components of certain raw fruit seeds make it 100% impossible to develop cancer and will kill existing cancer in most cases. The pharmaceutical companies pounced on this claim immediately and demanded that FDA studies be conducted. The results of these studies are found on this site and in a book called ""World Without Cancer"", by G. Edward Griffin. To order the book, please visit our Recommended Books page. Vitamin B17, also known as Laetrile and Amygdalin is found in most fruit seeds, namely apricot seeds. The apricot seed was claimed as the cure for all cancers over 35 years ago. It was even more strongly claimed that when one eats about 7 apricot seeds per day they can never develop cancer, just as one can never get scurvy if they have an orange every day, or pellagra if they have some B vitamins every day. The pharmaceuticals companies together with the medical establishment pushed the FDA into making it illegal to sell ""raw"" apricot seeds or vitamin B17 with information about its effects on cancer. Even to this day, you can't get raw apricot seeds in your health food store, only the sun dried ones which have all the important enzymes killed off. Pharmaceutical companies only conduct studies on patented chemicals they invent so that at the end of their study, if the drug gets approved, they have sole rights on its sale. (They make back tons more than the mere 250 million that they invested) They never do studies on foods that can't be patented and that can be sold by any supermarket. The information on this site is not just for preventing cancer, it is for those that have cancer now and are on chemo or radiation at this moment, as well as for those who have cancer but haven't started any conventional methods yet. Most of the people that already have cancer clusters in their body, who eat the apricot seeds and/or take the vitamin b17 in tablet form show near to complete tumor regression. Although cancer patients may get rid of their cancer, they also have the problem of the organ damage that the cancer has caused. This is another issue where other herbs and remedies are necessary for proper organ regeneration. Of course when a person's body is completely eaten up by cancer, the raw apricot seeds and its extract (laetrile and vitamin b17) would only prolong their life many times longer than chemotherapy and might not completely save them. However in many cases high levels of the injectable vitamin B17 ""laetrile"" will help a great deal with the pain.

About Our Research
Proteomics research in the Fenselau lab has been supported by the NIH since 2000. She has pioneered the use of O-18 labels, solution isoelectric focusing, microwave-supported acid cleavage and nanoparticle membrane pellicles in proteomic workflows. Her major interest is to understand at the protein level the mechanisms by which drug resistance and immunosuppression occur in cancer. She has collaborated successfully for several decades with cell biologists and microbiologists. She collaborates with cell biologists in the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, and with bioinformaticists at Georgetown Medical Center.
Another area of research addresses mass spectrometry-based methods for the rapid (<5 min) analysis of airborne microorganisms. For this challenge our laboratory has introduced the use of proteomic strategies to deduce the identities of bacteria, spores, viruses and protein toxins from MALDI mass spectra. Collaborators include the researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the Johns Hopkins Medical School and local industries.
Research in the Fenselau lab is strongly cross-disciplinary, and Dr. Fenselau welcomes graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from analytical chemistry, biochemistry, cell and molecular biology and bioengineering.
As one of the first trained mass spectroscopists to take a faculty position in a U.S. medical school (Johns Hopkins), Catherine Fenselau has led the application of mass spectrometry in many aspects of biomedical research. She has a record of working successfully with difficult samples. For example, she first identified the active metabolite of the widely used oncostatic cyclophosphamide, proved that the false anticancer agent Laetrile is actually a glucuronide conjugate, and demonstrated that allosteric hexamers of insulin held together by two zinc ions also complex six water molecules.
Instrumentation
All instrumentation required for protein biochemistry is available in the Fenselau Lab or in the Department. Laboratory facilities support 2D gel electrophoresis, capillary HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Both OffGel and GelFree devices are available for solution electrophoresis. High throughput proteomics analysis is carried out in the College Proteomics Facility using a state-of-the-art capLC-LTQ-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry system. Bioinformatics is supported by ProSightPC, MASCOT, PepArMl and a full line of Thermo software.

How Laetrile and Vitamin C Help Kill Cancer
Posted by Marie on August 31st, 2011
Laetrile and Vitamin C are two lesser-known cancer treatments that can make a huge impact on the spread of this disease. Used in conjunction with DMSO as an alternative cancer treatment program, these two vitamins offer an extremely effective cancer treatment with fewer side effects and far less stress to the patient.
What is Laetrile?
Also known as amygdalin or vitamin B17, laetrile is a substance that works to target and kill cancer cells using its own natural offenses. A laetrile molecule consists of three substances:
Glucose (a simple sugar)
Hydrogen cyanide
Benzaldehyde
A cancer cell contains many sugar transporters which grab sugar from the bloodstream and draw it into the cell to provide energy. As the laetrile molecule approaches, the cancer cell drags it inside and attempts to metabolize it. However, once inside, the laetrile molecule releases toxic cyanide and benzaldehyde and kills the cell. Due to this release of a toxic substance, there has been much controversy over the use of laetrile in the medical field, but it is now known that this metabolism pattern does not occur in normal cells and the laetrile affects only cancerous tissue.
How Does Vitamin C Help Fight Cancer?
Laetrile is often used in conjunction with therapeutic doses of vitamin C. It’s widely known that a diet rich in vitamins is an excellent way to prevent cancer, but vitamin C can also help fight cancer once it has already developed.
Vitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning that it scavenges damaging free radicals from the body and helps prevent cancer long-term. These free radicals, or molecules with unpaired electrons, can cause DNA damage to cells in the body. Since damaged DNA is what causes cells to mutate into cancer cells, vitamin C supplementation can help prevent the formation and spread of cancer. It’s also essential for maintaining good health and a strong immune system, so supplementation during cancer treatment has additional benefits on top of killing cancer cells.
An alternative cancer treatment clinics consult can help determine the best course of action for treatment. Used in conjunction with DMSO, laetrile and vitamin C have the potential to kill cancer cells and bring patients into remission.

World without Cancer – 6 of 6
Written on April 21, 2012 at 7:48 pm, by admin
The Story of Vitamin B17 (Laetrile) Written and Narrated by G. Edward Griffin. This is a video adaptation of a documentary filmstrip which explains the scientific rationale for Laetrile therapy. It presents evidence that cancer, like scurvy or pellagra, is a deficiency disease. It is not caused by the presence of some mysterious virus or X- factor, but by the lack of an essential food factor which, increasingly, is deleted from the menus of modern man. The native diets of those cultures where cancer is rare is examined and found to be 200 times more rich in this substance than the diet of industrialized society. The missing food factor is called amygdalin or vitamin B17, but in its concentrated and purified form developed specifically for cancer therapy, it is known as Laetrile. A theoretical model for the biological action of Laetrile is presented. Included are dramatic case histories of terminal cancer patients who have recovered using Laetrile therapy. Based upon the book of the same name. 60-min. video.

A peach pit is a hard nut to crack, but the seed looks a bit like an almond, and tastes a bit like one too, but just has less flavor.
If a peach seed will prevent cancer, then why not eat one?
My grandfather maintained that apple seeds are an important﻿ part of the diet for old men, he ate them.

Nice conclusion to the﻿ documentary. I only wished two years ago my father would’ve heard this information and be saved he will still be alive. But instead he went to the hospital to get “chemotherapy”, however, poisoned by chemicals and got radiation treatment and died 21 days later.
Now that I have it will share it with my friends and family the day they tell “I have cancer” and right away tell there is a cure and that cure is Laetrile.

Better stop Codex Alimentarius. They are trying to do away with any alternative cures , destroy our foods with GMO’s and make vitamins virtually useless. All in the name of big pharma. Look at DR. Rima’s vids here on Codex﻿ Alimentarius. They are in session. Because of Mr. Griffin’s book my daugther is alive. Ever so Grateful.

Cancer Treatment - The Role of Laetrile [B-17]
Laetrile is a cancer treatment produced from a common food enzyme,
B-17 derived from apricot seeds and almonds.
Laetrile was heralded as the major breakthrough in the treatment
of cancer. In this series of videos we look at the controversy around
the use of laetrile, the research and media reports, and how laetrile
is designed to work.
Cure Your Cancer - Undisclosed Research
How research was suppressed by medical authorities, refusing to
believe that a simple enzyme B-17 could have success in treating
cancer.
Cure Your Cancer - B17/Cycle of Tumors
Note: Laetrile is produced from amygdalin. Amydgalin is derived
from apricot seeds.
Cure Your Cancer - The Role of Laetrile
New anticancer discovery by scientists in Canada: DCA(dichloroacetate)
corrects a well documented metabolic dysfunction within cancer cells
known as glycolysis by reactivating dormant mitochondria. The mitochondria
then initiate apoptosis (or cell death).
DCA corrects a well documented metabolic dysfunction within cancer
cells, known as glycolysis, by reactivating dormant mitochondria.
The mitochondria then initiate apoptosis (or cell death).
DCA, is inexpensive due to the fact it cannot be patented as it
has been used for ~30 years to treat a metabolic syndrome in children.
It has a low toxicity level of roughly 600 mg/kg of body weight.
Cure Your Cancer - Dosage & Case Studies
Spreading The Word
Bitter almonds or other natural sources of B17 alone will not cure
cancer. You also need a doctor to administer injections of B17.
Sadly, most people try it when their bodies are beyond help and/or
have been severely poisoned by chemo. Scientists in London determined
that for B17 to work, its effectiveness would have to be increased
by 36-fold. To achieve this without ill effects, they administered
modified tumor antibodies that release cyanide right on the cancer
cells.
If injected intravenously, Laetrile might work on some early cancers,
but only if administered in high doses for brief periods (some also
suggest taking zinc to aid in rapid absorption). Eating bitter almonds
will aid slightly in preventing some forms of cancers, but consuming
large quantities at once or even in small amounts for prolonged
periods may cause severe poisoning in most people. Again, the exact
amount varies.
B17 is dangerous in small-continuous doses, because the cyanide
content will build up in ones system over time. From my understanding,
B17's toxicity levels have never been established, and they vary
enormously from person to person. To be honest, I wanted to remove
this video but several folks asked me not to--so here we are.

6,clueweb12-1906wb-16-17091,1,1,0,amygdalin laetrile cancer,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,unhelpful,"Part One -- The Science of Cancer Therapy
We at VitaminB17.org are deeply concerned that information about vitamin therapy to prevent and treat cancer be available to the public. To that end, the book WORLD WITHOUT CANCER � The Story of Vitamin B17
by G. Edward Griffin (Westlake Village, California: American Media, 1997. ISBN 0-912986-19-0) is available for sale through this site. However, we realize that many interested people may not have time or resources to read the book in its entirety, which we highly recommend. Therefore, we are quoting the brief synopsis printed at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, we are summarizing key points from the chapters, including succinct quotes from Griffin.
The book is divided into two parts:
Part One � The Science of Cancer Therapy
Part Two �The Politics of Cancer Therapy
PART ONE � THE SCIENCE OF CANCER THERAPY
CHAPTER ONE � THE WATERGATE SYNDROME
""Examples of dishonesty and corruption in the field of drug research; a close look at the first major study which declared Laetrile (vitamin B17) �of no value;� proof that the study was fraudulent; the FDA�s ruling against the use of Laetrile because it had not been tested; and the refusal then to allow anyone (except its opponents) to test it"" (p. 21).
In Chapter One Griffin describes how a report issued by the Cancer Commission of the California Medical Association in the April 1953 issue of California Medicine concluded, ""No satisfactory evidence has been produced to indicate any significant cytotoxic effect of Laetrile on the cancer cell"" (p. 27). While this conclusion has largely formed the basis of medical opinion throughout the U.S. since that time, Griffin shows that the conclusion was contrary to the raw findings in the research. The conclusion is a lie. In addition, the report had to admit that ""all of the physicians whose patients were reviewed spoke of increase in the sense of well-being and appetite, gain in weight, and decrease in pain"" (p. 33). All of this was dismissed as insignificant in the report.
Alluding to the questionable scientific integrity of the drafters of the report, Griffin notes that one drafter, Dr. Ian MacDonald, Chairman of the California Cancer Commission, ""had made national headlines claiming that there was no connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer"" (p. 29). MacDonald later died after being burned in bed by a cigarette-started fire. His associate on the report, Dr. Henry Garland, who had boasted that cigarettes are harmless, himself died of lung cancer. These are the so-called experts whose conclusions the medical profession continues to hold as the standard to this day.
Another fault of the study was that the doses of Laetrile given to patients were so weak that they could not give as much benefit as is possible. Patients were given fifty to one-hundred mg. per dose. By 1974, it was found that intravenous levels of six to nine thousand mg. daily were helpful and not at all harmful.
Proponents of Laetrile have repeatedly been denied the right to test it. The assumption from opponents that Laetrile is toxic is ""absurd inasmuch as all of the drugs approved by the FDA and currently used in orthodox cancer therapy are extremely toxic. To deny the testing of Laetrile on the grounds that it might be toxic is the height of sophistry"" (p. 35), says Griffin. (emphasis his.)
CHAPTER TWO � GENOCIDE IN MANHATTAN
""Continued attempts by the cancer industry to prove that Laetrile is worthless; the suppressed lab reports from the Sloan-Kettering Institute which proved that Laetrile works; the Rockefeller connection to the pharmaceutical industry; the story of how a group of employees at Sloan-Kettering leaked the truth to the outside world"" (p. 37).
Several paragraphs from this chapter deserve quoting:
How does one evaluate the success of a cancer treatment? Is it the length of life? The quality of life? The feeling of well-being and absence of pain? The ability to function normally on a daily basis? All of these are the criteria used by doctors who apply nutritional therapy. They are not concerned with the size of a tumor because, as stated previously, they know most tumors are a mixture of malignant and benign cells, and that most tumors have only a small percentage of cancer cells. If Laetrile succeeds in removing 100% of a patient�s cancer, his tumor may only decrease of 5% or 10%. But who cares? The patient is back among the living again. The tumor is not the disease, it is merely the symptom of the disease.
Orthodox medicine, on the other hand, is totally focused on the tumor. To most oncologists, the tumor is the cancer. If they remove it surgically or burn it away, they happily announce to the patient: ""Good news. We got it all!"" They may have all of the tumor, but did they get what caused the tumor? And, in the process, did they dislodge some of those malignant cells, causing them to migrate through the circulatory system only to find new homes elsewhere in the body? Is that the reason so many cancer patients die of metastasized cancer to multiple locations only a few months after hearing those ludicrous words: ""We got it all""?
In any event, Laetrile practitioners have always warned that reduction in tumor size is the least meaningful of all the measures of success�.A living and healthy patient with a tumor reduced by only 15% would be classified as a failure [by orthodox medicine]. A sick and dying patient with a tumor reduced 60% would be a success (p. 39).
CHAPTER THREE � AN APPLE A DAY
""A review of entrenched scientific error in history; the vitamin-deficiency concept of cancer as advanced in 1952 by Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr.; and a survey of the evidence both in nature and in history to support that concept"" (p. 53).
""The history of science is the history of struggle against entrenched error. Many of the world�s greatest discoveries initially were rejected by the scientific community. And those who pioneered those discoveries often were ridiculed and condemned as quacks and charlatans"" (p. 53). For example, it took many years after someone discovered that the killer scurvy could be prevented by eating fresh citrus before the prevention became acceptable to the medical community. The same is true with pellagra. Thirty years after it was discovered that eating liver or yeast could prevent the disease the medical profession accepted that the cause was a vitamin B deficiency. Griffin writes
By 1952, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr., a biochemist in San Francisco, had advanced the theory that cancer, like scurvy and pellagra, is not caused by some kind of mysterious bacterium, virus, or toxin, but is merely a deficiency disease aggravated by the lack of an essential food compound in modern-man�s diet. He identified this compound as part of the nitriloside family which occurs abundantly in nature in over twelve-hundred edible plants and found virtually in every part of the world. It is particularly prevalent in the seed of these fruits in the Prunus Rosacea family (bitter almond, apricot, blackthorn, cherry, nectarine, peach, and plum), but also contained in grasses, maize, sorghum, millet, cassava, linseed, apple seeds, and many other foods that, generally, have been deleted from the menus of modern civilization.
It is difficult to establish a clear-cut classification for a nitriloside. Since it does not occur entirely by itself but rather is found in foods, it probably should not be classified as a food. Like sugar, it is a food component or a food factor. Nor can it be classified as a drug inasmuch as it is a natural, non-toxic, water-soluble substance entirely normal to and compatible with human metabolism. The proper name for a food factor that contains these properties is vitamin. Since this vitamin normally is found with the B-complex, and since it was the seventeenth such substance to be isolated within this complex, Dr. Krebs identified it as vitamin B17 (p. 56).
Griffin further adds, ""A chronic disease is one which usually does not pass away of its own accord. A metabolic disease is one which occurs within the body and is not transmittable to another person. Cancer, therefore, being all of these, is a chronic, metabolic disease"" (p. 56). He adds
Dr. Krebs has pointed out that, in the entire history of medical science, there has not been one chronic, metabolic disease that was ever cured or prevented by drugs, surgery, or mechanical manipulation of the body. In every case � whether it be scurvy, pellagra, rickets, beri-beri, night blindness, pernicious anemia, or any of the others � the ultimate solution was found only in factors relating to adequate nutrition (p. 57).
CHAPTER FOUR � THE ULTIMATE TEST
""A look at the many cultures around the world that are, or have been, free from cancer; and an analysis of their native foods"" (p. 63).
Chapter Three takes a look at several cultures whose diet is rich in nitriloside foods. In each case the people are cancer-free. One is the Hunza tribe in the Himalaya Mountains. ""Their diet contains over two-hundred times more nitrilosides than the average American diet"" (p. 63). The most highly prized food is the apricot seed, which is very high in nitrilocides. Apricots, their seeds, and oil from the seeds are used much like rice and rice products would be used in other eastern cultures. In addition, their diet contains other vegetation rich in Vitamin B17. The life expectancy of the Hunzas is eighty-five years.
Eskimos have also been free of cancer when they eat their traditional diet. They don�t have access to apricot seeds or other vegetation of importance, yet their diet is rich in nitrilosides from the flesh of caribou and other grazing animals that do eat nitrilosides. Eskimos eat the vegetative stomach contents of freshly killed game that has just been grazing on grasses full of B17.
Griffin notes that even populations in the U.S. who are predominately vegetarian, such as Seven Day Adventists and Mormons, have lower cancer incidents. Indigenous people like Eskimos, when introduced to ""civilized"" foods, do begin to develop cases of cancer.
CHAPTER FIVE � CANCER: THE ONRUSH OF LIFE
""An explanation of the trophoblast thesis of cancer; a description of a simple urine test for cancer; an appraisal of BCG vaccine as an anti-cancer agent; and a review of the vital role played by the pancreas in the control of cancer"" (p. 75).
Griffin writes
In 1902, John Beard, a professor of embryology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, authored a paper published in the British medical journal Lancet in which he stated there were no differences between cancer cells and certain pre-embryonic cells that were normal to the early stages of pregnancy. In technical terms, these normal cells are called trophoblasts. Extensive research had led Professor Beard to the conclusion that cancer and trophoblast are, in fact, one and the same. His theory, therefore, is known as the trophoblast thesis of cancer (p. 75).
Apparently, when a trophoblast cell develops in the body without the controlling forces in pregnancy, its behavior pattern is to grow, spread, and multiply, becoming cancer.
Griffin explains: ""Before we can hope to conquer cancer, first we must understand how nature conquers cancer � how nature protects the body and controls the growth of trophoblast cells. One would suppose that this would be the primary question that determines the direction of cancer research today. Unfortunately, it is not. Most research projects are preoccupied with exotic and toxic drugs or machines that deliver death rays to selected parts of the body"" (p. 79).
One would assume that white blood cells, which attack harmful cells that cause infections, ought to attack cancer cells. Why don�t they? There is a protein coating with a negative electrostatic charge surrounding trophoblast cells; white blood cells also have a negative charge. Therefore, they repel each other.
How does nature destroy trophoblast cells? Pancreatic enzymes, when in the small intestine, dissolve the protein coating, allowing white blood cells to kill the trophoblast cells.
Griffin explains that a false assumption is that cancer cells are foreign entities and should all be destroyed. He declares that in the right balance trophoblast cells are a natural part of pregnancy and healing. Cancer occurs when an imbalance is present in the process.
CHAPTER SIX � THE TOTAL MECHANISM
""The nutritional factor as a back-up mechanism to the enzyme factor; a biographical sketch of Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr., and his development of Laetrile; the beneficial effects of vitamin B17 on a wide range of human disorders; and an appraisal of the complexity of nature�s total anti-cancer mechanism"" (p. 85).
What happens when this first line of defense is inadequate due to a diet that requires all the pancreatic enzymes for digestion, leaving nothing to battle cancer cells? Or what if the person�s body is subject to damage, such as from smoking cigarettes? Griffin says that nature has provided a second line of defense found in foods rich in nitrilosides. He writes
The chemical compound in question is vitamin B17, which is found in those natural foods containing nitriloside. It is known also as amygdalin and, as such, has been used and studied extensively for well over a hundred years. But, in its concentrated and purified form developed by Dr. [Ernst] Krebs specifically for cancer therapy, it is known as Laetrile (p. 86).
Griffin introduces the work of Krebs.
By 1950 he had identified the specific composition of this substance, had isolated it into crystalline form, had given it the name Laetrile, and had tested it on animals to make sure it was not toxic. The next step was to prove that it was not harmful to humans. There was only one way to do that. So he rolled up his sleeve and injected it into his own bloodstream�.
The B17 molecule contains two units of glucose (sugar), one of banzaldehyde, and one of cyanide, all tightly locked together within it. As everyone knows, cyanide can be highly toxic and even fatal if taken in sufficient quantity. However, locked as it is in this natural state, it is chemically inert and has absolutely no effect on living tissue�.
There is only one substance that can unlock the B17 molecule and release the cyanide. That substance is an enzyme called beta-glucosidase, which we shall call the ""unlocking enzyme."" When B17 comes in contact with the enzyme in the presence of water, not only is the cyanide released, but also the benzaldehyde, which is highly toxic by itself�.
Fortunately, the unlocking enzyme is not found to any dangerous degree anywhere in the body except at the cancer cell, where it always is present in great quantity, sometimes at levels in excess of one-hundred times that of the surrounding normal cells. The result is that vitamin B17 is unlocked at the cancer cell, releases its poisons to the cancer cell, and only to the cancer cell.
There is another important enzyme called rhodanese, which we shall identify as the ""protecting enzyme."" The reason is that it has the ability to neutralize cyanide by converting it instantly into by-products that actually are beneficial and essential to health. This enzyme is found in great quantities in every part of the body except the cancer cell which, consequently, is not protected (p. 88-89). (emphasis his.)
CHAPTER SEVEN � THE CYANIDE SCARE
""A newspaper account of a couple who reportedly were poisoned by eating apricot kernels; a close look at the real facts in this case; an evaluation of the toxic potential of seeds containing B17; and proof that Laetrile is less toxic than sugar"" (p. 95).
Griffin tells us that laboratory forms of B17 (amygdalin, Laetrile) have been described as non-toxic in pharmacology books for over one hundred years. He compares this to common aspirin, which is ""twenty times more toxic than the equivalent amount of Laetrile. The toxicity of aspirin is cumulative and can build up for days or even months. The chemical action of B17, however, is completed usually within a few hours leaving behind absolutely no build-up"" (p. 102).
CHAPTER EIGHT � THE LAETRILE ""QUACKS""
""The names, professional standings, medical achievements, and clinical findings of some of the more prominent doctors who endorse Laetrile; the beneficial side-effects produced by its use; a suggested anti-cancer diet; and a brief description of vitamin B15"" (p. 105).
This graph was reproduced from
information found on page 110 of World Without Cancer. It was
originally reproduced from Alive and Well: One Doctor�s Experience with Nutrition in the Treatment of Cancer Patients, by Philip E. Binzel, M.D. (Westlake Village, California: American Media, 1997, p. 113.)
The best results in treating cancer with Laetrile come when it is combined with supplemental vitamin therapy as well. The chapter gives an overview of such therapy.
CHAPTER NINE � ""UNPROVEN"" CANCER CURES
""Clinical evidence in support of the trophoblast thesis; laboratory experiments showing that Laetrile kills cancer cells; and case histories of terminal cancer patients who attribute their recovery to the effect of Laetrile"" (p. 115).
Griffin writes
The cyanide scare mentioned previously was but one small salvo in the continuing barrage of officialdom�s attacks against Laetrile. The total weaponry runs the gamut from scare tactics to outright falsehoods. But mostly they take the form of scholarly pronouncements, cloaked in the cloth of apparent concern for the public welfare, that vitamin therapy may sound good in theory, but in practice, it simply dos not work (p. 115).
Thousands of case histories have been documented showing that Laetrile successfully has treated cancer. However, orthodox medicine still claims that there is no proof. To contradict documented cases of cancers being successfully treated with Laetrile, doctors often claim that the patient went into spontaneous remission or that the patient never had cancer to begin with.
CHAPTER TEN � ""PROVEN"" CANCER CURES
""The effects of surgery and radiation in the treatment of cancer; a comparison showing that those who receive no treatment at all live just as long, if not longer, than those who are treated"" (p. 137).
Griffin notes that proponents of Laetrile treatment approach cancer from the belief that it is a ""deficiency disease""; therefore, it cannot be ""cured,"" rather prevented and treated. He shows that representatives of the cancer industry claim to have cures. Chapter Ten explores the first two of three ""cures"": surgery, radiation, and drugs.
Surgery can indeed save lives, and has the advantage of removing the tumor. Hope springs forth in the patient and his family, but often cancer shows up somewhere else in the body because the underlying cause has not been addressed. However, surgery poses two complications. ""First, it causes physical trauma to the area. This triggers off the healing process which, in turn, brings more trophoblast cells into being as a by-product of that process�The other effect is that, if not all the malignant tissue is removed, what remains tends to be encased in scar tissue �the cancer tends to become insulated from the action of the pancreatic trophoblast cells to the surveillant action of the white blood cells�there is no sold evidence that patients who submit to surgery have any greater life expectancy, on the average, than those who do not"" (p. 139).
Statistics show that the ""rate of long-term survival after surgery is, on the average at best, only ten or fifteen percent. And once the cancer has metastisized to a second location, surgery has almost no survival value"" (p. 141). (emphasis his.)
The purpose of X-ray therapy, the second orthodox treatment, is to burn away the tumor. Because tumors are comprised of both cancer and noncancer cells, and X-rays are more effective in destroying noncancer cells than cancer, the effect is to ""increase the percentage of malignancy"" (p. 142). This treatment seems to increase the probability that cancer will appear in another part of the body given time because it damages the body, causing a production of trophoblast cells that are trying to bring healing and because it lessens the production of white blood cells. Statistics do not show that X-ray treatment improves the chance for survival.
Griffin next explains how the American Cancer Society arrives at its positive sounding statistics for orthodox treatment.
CHAPTER ELEVEN � A NEW DIMENSION OF MURDER
""Anti-cancer drugs shown to be ineffective and cancer-causing; FDA-approved experiments on humans resulting in death from drugs rather than from cancer"" (p. 151).
Drugs used in chemotherapy are selected because their primary function is as a poison. They are supposed to differentiate, not between cancer and noncancer cells, but between slow-growing and fast-growing. Consequently, many healthy cells are destroyed. The immune system is weakened. The patient suffers effects of poisoning, such as, ""nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, cramps, and progressive weakness"" (p. 152). His hair falls out because hair cells are targeted as ""fast-growing."" While his family stands by as sorrowful witnesses, the patient goes through agony of body and mind, only to find that his chances of long-term survival are minimal.
CHAPTER TWELVE � A STATISTICAL COMPARISON
""The inherent weaknesses of all cancer statistics; the need for statistical comparisons in spite of those weaknesses; a comparison of the results obtained by orthodox and Laetrile physicians; and the consequences of consensus medicine"" (p. 165).
Best results from Laetrile therapy, of course, are obtained when the body has not been severely damaged by surgery, X-rays, or chemotherapy, in other words, ""virgin"" cases.
Griffin explains in Chapter Eleven that consensus medicine occurs when ""�the physician cannot follow his own judgement or his conscience. He gets into far more trouble by prescribing a few non-toxic vitamins than by prescribing the most radical surgery or violent chemical poisons. All but the very brave toe the line"" (p. 172).
Dr. Krebs, developer of Laetrile, has noted that cancer is ""one of the last outposts of mysticism in medical science."" Someday the brutal treatments of today will be classified with old treatments like bloodletting.

Melatonin Information
Melatonin Side Effects
The most common Melatonin side-effect is headache and/or an altered sleep pattern. Mental or mood changes may also occur as well as itching, fast heartbeat or heavy headedness. Melatonin may cause lowering of the body temperature. Vivid dream is also associated with melatonin use. Melatonin side-effects are usually temporary and can be relieved by reducing the melatonin dosage. About 8% of people taking 5 mg of melatonin or less per day will feel sleepy during the day. For a complete list of melatonin side effects pls. visit this link:http://www.melatoninfaq.com/melatonin-side-effects/ . It is very important to note that the long term side effects of Melatonin are still unknown. There is a need for more research to know what are the side effects of melatonin if it is used for a very long time.
What is Melatonin ?
Melatonin is also known as 5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine. This is a hormone that is found in all biological organisms. The level of melatonin inside an organism varies in a predefined cycle and is affected by the amount of light the body receives. Melatonin on humans is produced by the pineal gland from the amino acid Tryptophan. It helps the body know when it’s time to sleep or when it’s time to wake up. Melatonin is released at night or in the dark and sort of instructs the body that it is time to sleep.Young and middle-aged adults usually produce about 5 to 25 micrograms of melatonin per night. This level declines as a person ages and this is reported to be the reason why older persons have difficulty sleeping. Two forms of melatonin exist on the market, the natural form which comes from the pineal gland of animals and the synthetic form which is made from reacting certain chemical compounds. Natural melatonin may pose a risk to humans because it can be contaminated with animal viruses. Synthetic melatonin is safer to use because it is free from biological contaminants.
Melatonin For Sleep
Melatonin maintains the Circadian Rhythm of our body. The Circadian Rhythm is the built-in 24-Hour “clock” inside our body which plays an important role when we should wake up and when we should fall asleep. When your surrounding is dark, the body produces more melatonin; When your surrounding is bright, the production of melatonin is reduced. Without an increase in melatonin production in the evening, it will be difficult to fall asleep. Melatonin production rise when the sun goes down and appears to peak at 2:00 AM. When you are exposed to bright lights in the evening or you have very little light during daytime, the normal melatonin cycle of the body can be disrupted. Jet lag, Night Shift Work and Poor vision are some of the things that can disrupt normal melatonin cycles. Taking melatonin tablets before going to sleep can supplement the melatonin levels of the body, which makes sleeping come easily and consistently.
Uses of Melatonin – Melatonin Benefits
Although melatonin is very popular as a Sleep Remedy or Sleep Aid and as a natural treatment for Insomnia. Melatonin has other uses aside from improving sleep. Studies show that it can be used as an antioxidant, cancer protective agent, skin protective agent, contraceptive and as a treatment for Seasonal affective depression. As you can see, Melatonin is a multi-functional hormone that is produced naturally by the human body. There are other uses for melatonin which are still being studied today. We have listed the more common use of melatonin below.
1. Melatonin Sleep Aid/Melatonin as a Natural Sleeping Pills – Melatonin is a natural sleeping aid. During daytime, the blood level of melatonin is low and increases at night. Melatonin supplements that are given during the day makes anyone feel sleepy. Natural melatonin production in the brain is highest between 2am and 4am and declines as a person ages. Users of melatonin reported an increase in the vividness and frequency of their dreams.
2. Melatonin as an Antioxidant – Melatonin is an antioxidant which is both active in water and oil phase. Vitamin-C and Glutathione are only active in water phase while Vitamin E and Vitamin A are only active in oil phase.
3. Cancer protection (Possible anti-tumor properties) - Women with breast cancer have lower levels of melatonin compared to cancer free individuals. Melatonin also inhibits the growth of certain types of breast cancer cells. Preliminary experiments suggest that melatonin may enhance the effectiveness of some chemotherapy drugs. Men with prostate cancer also have lower levels of melatonin compared to normal individuals. One study reported that the addition of melatonin to conventional anti-cancer drugs enhanced the survivable rates of men with metastatic prostate cancer.
4. Oral contraceptive – Melatonin also plays a role in the endocrine-reproductive system and it reduces the circulation of Leutenizing Hormone. Melatonin may inhibit ovulation in women and it had been suggested for use in combination with other contraceptives. Some studies suggest that melatonin actually stimulates reproduction. It is noted that when men take high doses of melatonin, there is an associated decrease in sperm mobility and sex drive.
5. Skin protection from ultraviolet light – Topical melatonin when combined with vitamins C and E exhibits photo protective property. Melatonin can be used as a natural sunscreen.
6. Insomnia – Several studies suggest that melatonin taken by mouth before going to sleep helps a person fall asleep faster. It is best to take it 1 or 1 and a half hours before going to sleep.
7. Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder - Some studies show that people which suffers from major depression or panic disorder have low blood levels of melatonin. There are experimental studies showing that melatonin increases serotonin levels which helps reduce the symptoms of depressive illness.
8. Jet Lag and Work Shifts – Melatonin reduces the time it takes to establish normal sleep pattern and reduces the time it takes to fall asleep and reduces daytime tiredness. Working at night shifts or staying up all night upsets the biological clock of the body. This causes fatigue, dizziness and disability to have clear thinking. Using melatonin before bedtime helps restore the biological clock function and relieves those symptoms.
9. Melatonin for Alzheimer’s Disease Patients - Melatonin has some positive effects on patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. It can improve their sleep and possibly slow down cognitive impairment.
Reference: The use of melatonin in Alzheimer’s disease. Neuro Endocrinol Lett. 2002 Apr;23 Suppl 1:20-3.
- Melatonin improved sleep and suppressed sundowning, an effect seen regardless of the concomitant medication employed to treat cognitive or behavioral signs of AD. Melatonin treatment seems to constitute a selection therapy to ameliorate sundowning and to slow evolution of cognitive impairment in AD patients.
10. Anti-Aging / Longevity – The positive effects of melatonin on deep restorative sleep could also account for a longer life span. The University of Rajasthan in India tested the influence of chronic administration of low dose melatonin against age-induced oxidative stress on the tissue of mice. The result of the study satates that Melatonin is able to reduce age-induced decline in the body’s natural antioxidant system. The study also indicates that melatonin is also acting as a free radical scavenger and an anti-aging agent.
11. Irritable Bowel Syndrome – Melatonin can improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in patients who are suffering from sleep disturbances. The use of 3mg Melatonin for two weeks have significantly reduced abdominal pain and bloating, while also reducing the sensitivity of the rectum.
12. Migraine headache reduction – Additional research is needed to see if melatonin is effective for treating migraine. Studies show that there is a relationship between Melatonin and Headache. A research of Dr. Mario Peres, of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, in Sao Paulo, Brazil showed that there is at least 50 percent reduction in the frequency of headache after three months of Melatonin treatment (3 milligrams of melatonin 30 minutes before bedtime).
13. Dream Enhancement (Vivid Dreams) - The use of melatonin can lead to vivid, memorable and enjoyable dreams but it can also lead to vivid nightmares. Melatonin improves REM sleep. Any dose of Melatonin that is higher than 1 mg is likely to make dreams very intense. People have reported encountering nightmares on high doses ( typically 2 to 5 mg ).
14. Immune system booster – Animals research shows that melatonin can provide a short term enhancement or stimulation of the immune system. Human studies are not yet established.
15. Diabetes (Adjunct Therapy) - Melatonin used together with Zinc may improve glycemic control in patients that are not responding well to Metformin.
16. Menopause – Melatonin have been reported to have some beneficial effects in treating the symptoms associated with Menopause. However, more research is needed to support these claims.
17. Anti-Inflammatory – A limited research shows that melatonin may posses anti-inflammatory actions.
18. Anti-Anxiety – Melatonin can also be used as an anti-anxiety agent.
Age related anxiety is common in the elderly. Elders experience more anxiety compared to younger persons. An experiment conducted by C. Garzon and associates (February 2009 issue of “Aging Clinical and Experimental Research”) shows that melatonin decreased age related anxiety compared to placebo.
Surgical Anxiety – It is very common for people to experience anxiety before surgery. This is of course a problem for people needing surgical procedures. Having anxiety before an operation can delay or affect the immediate outcome of a surgical procedure. Sedatives can relieve the surgical anxiety of a person but it may have negative side effects. A study by Salah A. Ismail and colleagues April 2009 edition of “Anesthesia & Analgesia”) shows that patients who have been given melatonin experienced less anxiety and pain during an eye surgery.
Melatonin Dosage and Melatonin Overdose
The recommended dosage for melatonin is 1 mg to 5 mg. This is considered to be a safe and effective dosage. It would be a good idea to start first at the lowest melatonin dosage ( 0.3 mg ) and then gradually increase your dosage until you find the most effective dosage for you.
Melatonin Supplement
Melatonin supplements are available over the counter. It is sold as a food supplement and not as a drug. Melatonin supplements com in tablets, capsules and liquid form.
Melatonin For Children
Current research shows that short term use of Melatonin on children over 12 years of age is safe. The long term safety of Melatonin on children has not been established. Long term use of melatonin on kids is not recommended.
Melatonin For Dogs
Melatonin can also be used on dogs to help them sleep better or to have a mild sedative effect.

What are the precautions when using Melatonin?
If you have immune system disorder, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, stroke or depression you should consult first your doctor before taking melatonin supplements. You should limit alcohol consumption because it may aggravate some of the side effects of this medicine. Extra caution is advised when you are performing tasks that require alertness such as driving. It is not recommended to take melatonin if you are planning to have pregnancy. Melatonin is not recommended for persons under 20 years old.
Is Melatonin Safe – Melatonin Safety

Melatonin is produced naturally in the brain by sun exposure during the day. 30 minutes to 2 hours of sun a day is ideal to produce melatonin at night and serotonin in the day. It works best by going outside in the AM. Take the paper and coffee and sit outside for 10 minutes or more in the AM. Take breakfast out there, if you can. Sit outside when you can for breaks or lunch. Maybe spend 10-15 minutes minutes outside when you get home.

my mom gave me a bottle of melatonin tabs that she had bought to help with jet lagg but had never opened it. i have always struggled with going to bed at a decent hour so started taking half a tablet….i have never slept so well and i dont feel groggy in the mornings and function great in the day as i am sleeping very well. i also suffer from depression and take prosac 20mg. i didnt know that melatonin could be used to treat depression til i read this but it certainly hasnt had any negative effects. i highly reccommend this as a sleep aid

I know someone that gives their infant child melitonin everynight to sleep through the night along with benidryll and tylenol. Do you think this is a worthy cause to call CPS?

Don’t rush to judgement. How old is the child? Are there sleep disturbances that are being treated? Low dose Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen) have been safely used for years to treat insomnia in children. Melatonin as an adjunct helps establish the sleep rhythm. Do a bit more research before you destroy a family. BUT, if this is an infant and the doses are adult dosage then get on the phone now.

Yes! It’s a big reason for concern. Tylenol is known to cause liver damage when given for lengthy periods of time. And Benadryl is not to be given to kids under 6 years of age now due to the effects it causes on the child’s breathing system.

A close friend of mine recently suddenly died. It has not yet been
determined what was the cause of death. She was 60 yrs. old.
She just went through a divorce and was understandably depressed.
I don’t know the dosage but I believe she started taking melatonin
to help her sleep. She was also drinking wine, heavily at certain
times. Could this have been a deadly concoction that caused her
untimely death?

No. Melatonin is a natural chemical of the brain, it wouldn’t react with alcohol in any way.

It says on the bottle not to consume alcoholic beverages , operate heavy machinery and use caution while driving. Alcohol can cause a side effect with any mediation due to the fact that alcohol changes chemical balances in our body as well. As a precaution most medications state not to consume alcohol or limit intake due to possible side effects that can come from alcohol consumption.

One of my friends gave me a couple melatonin pills – I’ve been kinda chicken about trying it as well. I have anxiety and depression. I also have trouble waking up – I feel groggy after a full night of rest. – I’ve been taking Valium 10mg for my anxiety. Looking to go more natural. Will melatonin really help with anxiety/depression and regular lethargy for half the day after waking up?

For restlessness, use Melatonin. Start the first night with a dose between 2-5mg. Take it an hour and a half before attempting sleep and don’t eat 30 mins before that so that the melatonin can be utilized quickly. The next night if all goes well (you may have vivid dreams like I do, all great so far! Vivid nightmares can happen too, but that just adds to experience.), try out 2-3mg. The next night do 1-2, and every night after switch to 1. After a while, your body might pick up on the trend and not need as much or any.
Now, for depression/anxiety, try out 5HTP. 5HTP comes a bit in melatonin, but that’s because melatonin develops into seratonin. 5HTP does a better job at bring up your seratonin levels. Start with 20mg a day. If nothing works after a week, jump it to 50. Try that for a few days, and if you’re still not feeling it, 100mg is usually the max. (Although certain studies have attempted 300mg a day, but that isn’t recommended or safe.) reply here if you have any success or questions!

I have always had problems sleeping (as long as I can remember), but recently with my 2nd daughter born, I started taking Unisom sleep melt + Melatonin…
However I keep reading that I shouldn’t take it for more than 3 months. I have never slept that well and easily as on those 2.
But now I am trying to stop for a while to not go over 3 months and replacec it for Valerian root and I am back staying up in the morning hours ….
So my question how long do I have to be off of it to be able to get back on it without problems…
I have never been able to fall asleep that well, if I have to take those 2 forever, I will gladly ax long as it’s not too unhealthy.

No, it wont. You need to revsisit your psychiatrist. The 10mg of vailum is probably what is making you feel groggy and lethargic. I think if you adjust psych meds, that will help you overall.

If I were you, I would be very reluctant to add melatonin to your mix. You are already taking a tremendously powerful drug, and any self-medication added on to that — especially where depression and anxiety are involved — is Russian Roulette. Most supplements are little more than placebos for most people, but melatonin is a potent hormone that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier when taken as an oral supplement. It has an impact — for good or bad — on virtually everyone who takes it. The problem is that a wide variety of results are reported. Lots of people who already suffer from depression report that it makes their symptoms much worse. For people who do not suffer from depression but can’t regulate their sleep cycles, melatonin is like a miracle drug. It has many other beneficial side-effects that have been documented from many year’s worth of controlled studies. Melatonin is at the end of the Trypophan->Seritonin->Melatonin cycle, and, as such should not have an effect on depression. But, widely reported experience says otherwise. My personal reaction to it was that it has a “dulling” effect on my emotions — making me feel neither better nor much worse. I seemed to have less of every emotion; that is better than depression — but not much better. This is, strangely, the same reaction that many people have to SRIs like Prozac. In your case, already having trouble with depression and lethargy leads me to think that melatonin is probably the last thing you should be taking. I’d suggest you look into taking 5-HTP, which is the intermediate amino acid in the Tryptophan->Seritonin part of the equation. In theory, 5-HTP supplementation increases Seritonin production which, in turn, tends to ameliorate symptoms of depression. 5-HTP supplements are not proven to help with depression, but, at least, no one ever complains that it makes them feel worse.

Little Sleep Benefit From Melatonin, Study Shows
A US government review of more than 50 studies on the effect of melatonin on sleep has found little evidence that the supplement helps people drift off.
While melatonin does aid sleep in a certain group of people whose biological clocks are out of kilter, researchers found it does not promote sleep among the most common users of the supplement - those suffering from jet lag or weary shift workers.
""A lot of people take melatonin for jet lag and shift work, but we found no good evidence to justify the use of melatonin in this context,"" says study author Dr. Terry Klassen, director of the Evidence-Based Practice Center at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.
Insomnia a Major Problem for Americans
According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 40 million Americans suffer from chronic, long-term sleep disorders each year, and an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems. Insomnia tends to increase with age and affects about 40 percent of women and 30 percent of men.
The most common sleep disorders are insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome (particularly among elderly people), and narcolepsy, a condition in which people suddenly fall asleep for short periods of time even if they are well-rested.
Melatonin is a hormone found in the brain that helps the body's sleeping and waking schedule. Typically, melatonin levels rise in the evening, causing sleepiness, and are lower in the morning to induce waking.
The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, was published online by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).
The report is the most comprehensive look at the science behind the claims that melatonin is a beneficial sleep aid, Dr. Klassen says.
""There has been a lot of emphasis on individual studies rather than the overall picture, but when you put it all together, it tells a more compelling story,"" he explains.
The researchers found the quality of the studies varied, with those that looked at the effects of melatonin on normal sleepers generally of lower quality than those studies that looked at people with sleep problems.
Further, Dr. Klassen notes, all the studies tended to be small and of short duration, with an average length of a few months, so that the long-term effects of melatonin could not be assessed.
Debate Over Melatonin Benefit Continues
The authors also noted that in the studies assessing the benefits of melatonin for normal sleepers, ""there was considerable evidence of possible publication bias in the selection of the studies analyzed,"" they write. ""We found a greater number of studies reporting positive results compared to negative results.""
The one area where melatonin did seem to work was with a group of people with a condition called ""delayed sleep phase syndrome,"" which means that otherwise healthy people have a biological quirk that prevents a normal sleep cycle. For these people, Dr. Klassen says, taking melatonin appeared to improve their sleep.
""Melatonin helped to reset their biological clock,"" he says, so that on average it reduced the time it took them to fall asleep by about a half-hour.
Dr. Klassen says that although many people swear that melatonin works for them when they are suffering from jet lag, the science simply does not back up these claims.
""It could be a placebo [inactive substance] effect, or the fact that sleep disorders vary, and that someone would get better anyway,"" he says.
""When people go into stores, if a bottle of melatonin has the word 'sleep' on it, there is an implied medical claim that they're going to sleep better, and this report doesn't support these implied benefits,"" says Dr. Meir Kryger, author of A Woman's Guide to Sleep Disorders. ""It's a very good study.""
This is exactly why evidence-based studies are so important, Dr. Klassen says.
""This is a huge issue, and an area where we should be spending money to fund rigorous testing of these claims,"" he says.

Insomnia Defined
According to the National Sleep Foundation, it is not unusual to have sleep troubles from time to time. But, if you feel that you do not get enough sleep or satisfying sleep, you may have insomnia, a sleep disorder.
People with insomnia have one or more of the following:
difficulty falling asleep
waking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep
waking up too early in the morning
unrefreshing sleep
Insomnia can cause problems during the day, such as sleepiness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. A person with insomnia may also have another sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and restless legs syndrome.
Insomnia is not defined by the number of hours you sleep every night. The amount of sleep a person needs varies. While most people need between seven and eight hours of sleep a night, some people do well with less, and some need more.
Acute, or short-term insomnia may not require treatment. But if your insomnia makes it hard to function during the day because you are sleepy and tired, your health care provider may prescribe sleeping pills for a limited time.
The rapid onset, short-acting medications now available avoid many of the earlier problems with continuing effects (like feeling drowsy or groggy) the following day.
Some medications may be less effective after several weeks of nightly use, however, and long-term safety and effectiveness has not yet been established.
Side effects of sleeping pills (and over-the-counter sleep medicines) can be a problem, too. Mild insomnia often can be prevented or cured by practicing good sleep habits.
Treatment for chronic (long-term) insomnia includes first treating any underlying conditions or health problems that are causing the insomnia.
If insomnia continues, your health care provider may suggest behavioral therapy or medication. Most medicines that are used for sleep have side effects and must be used with caution.
It is not recommended to use over-the-counter sleeping pills for insomnia. Behavioral approaches to treatment focus on changing behaviors that may worsen insomnia and learning new behaviors to promote sleep.
Techniques such as relaxation exercises, sleep restriction therapy, and reconditioning may be useful.
Always consult your physician for more information.

Growing induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) without Animal Products:Ideally, stem cells used to treat human beings will be grown without exposure to animal products such as the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or bovine serum used in standard stem cell culture. Previously, scientists developed xeno-free (animal-free) culture systems for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by using serum replacement with fibronectin matrix or human fibroblast feeder layers. Building on this knowledge, privately-funded scientists have now developed a xeno-free derivation and culture system for human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The scientists eliminated animal products from each step of the process, including the viral particles used for reprogramming. iPSCs generated and grown under these xeno-free conditions demonstrate expected characteristics of pluripotent cells, including the ability to form teratomas and generate cells characteristic of all three germ layers. This work may one day help scientists develop standardized animal-free human stem cell therapies. Stem Cells Dev. Epub ahead of print; laboratory of J.B. Cibelli. 2009 Dec 23.
Lack of diversity in most commonly-used hESC lines: Privately-funded researchers examined the genetic ancestry of the most commonly-used hESC lines by comparing the genotypes of hESC lines to reference datasets from the HapMap and Human Genome Diversity Projects. They found that the majority of the hESC lines cluster with (or are most similar to) individuals of European and Middle Eastern origin. Two of the lines clustered with data from East Asians, and none clustered with data from individuals of African ancestry. If hESC studies are to improve human health, it is important that they accurately represent the genetic variations common to the population. Accordingly, the authors propose that derivation of new hESC lines should emphasize underrepresented populations, N Engl J Med 362(2):183-185, 2010. Epub 2009 Dec.; laboratory of S.J. Morrison.
New hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant protocol reverses sickle cell anemia in adults:Individuals with sickle cell disease, also known as sickle cell anemia, carry an abnormal gene for the oxygen-carrying protein called hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). The abnormal hemoglobin causes RBCs to collapse into a sickle, or C-shape, and become stiff and sticky. Clumps of these abnormal RBCs block blood flow and can cause severe pain, organ damage from lack of oxygen, and stroke. Individuals with sickle cell disease often develop anemia because sickle cells die off quickly and bone marrow does not make new RBCs fast enough. Scientists have been able to cure children with severe sickle cell disease by using myeloablative conditioning, which destroys the child’s own diseased bone marrow, combined with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC, found in bone marrow) transplantation. However, scientists have not been able to cure adults with severe sickle cell disease because adults cannot tolerate the toxicity of myeloablative conditioning plus the HSC transplant procedure. Attempts to cure adults using less toxic non-myeloablative conditioning plus HSC transplant have not been successful – adults either destroy the transplanted bone marrow stem cells or develop severe graft versus host disease (GVHD). NIH intramural researchers tested a new protocol using a drug, sirolimus, to attempt to induce immune system tolerance of transplanted HSCs under non-myeloablative conditions. Ten adults with severe sickle cell disease were transplanted under the new protocol. All of the treated individuals survived, and the treatment reversed the disease in 9 of them. If these results can be repeated on a larger scale, this new method of inducing tolerance to transplants may one day be available to cure adults with severe sickle cell disease. Hsieh et al, NEJM 361: 2309-2317; laboratories of G.P. Rodgers, J.D. Powell, and J.F. Tisdale. 2009 Dec 10.
Adult stem cells may provide a new weapon against AIDS:Although anti-viral drugs help individuals with HIV to manage their symptoms, new options are needed. Privately-funded scientists have reprogrammed bone marrow stem cells into ""killer"" T-cells with anti-HIV receptors. The new HIV-specific ""killer"" T-cells recognized and killed cells that had gobbled up HIV and displayed the HIV proteins on their surfaces (HIV antigen-presenting cells) in a humanized mouse model of HIV (an immune-compromised mouse with human fetal thymus and liver). This strategy may help scientists find a way to re-establish immune control of HIV and other diseases that outwit the human immune system. PLoS One. 4(12): e8208, 2009; laboratory of J.A. Zack. 2009 Dec 7.
iPSCs may help treat human age-related macular degeneration:Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a supporting cell layer critical to the survival and function of rods and cones in the retina of the eye. Scientists have previously demonstrated that RPE cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) improve vision when transplanted to a rat model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Now scientists supported by the United Kingdom have tested whether RPE cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the same capabilities. When iPSC-derived RPEs were transplanted into the same rat AMD model, they preserved retinal integrity and vision if given before degeneration began. However, iPSC-derived RPE cells don’t survive as long as hESC-derived RPE cells. The scientists propose that the noted improvements in vision may result from either:
The transplanted cells' ability to attract the host inflammatory response; the host phagocytes may help replace the debris-removing function of lost RPE cells.
The transplanted cells may have a neuroprotective effect on host RPE cells. Thus, even if human iPSC-derived RPE cells don't survive long term, these cells may still prove to be a useful therapy for human RPE. Carr et al. PLoS One. 4(12): e-8152, 2009; laboratory of P.J. Coffey. 2009 Dec 3.
New techniques improve utility of iPSCs:
In the original technique for generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the reprogramming factors are carried into the adult cells using inactivated viruses that integrate at random into the host DNA. This is dangerous because of the possibility that the virus will interrupt or otherwise damage the normal function of a critical gene in the host cell. NIH-supported scientists report progress towards using a single virus to introduce the reprogramming genes (thus reducing the number of insertions) and the ability to control where the virus actually inserts. These changes move us a bit further toward improving the utility of iPSCs for treating humans. Carey et al. Nature Methods Advance Online Publication; Stadtfeld et al. Nature Methods Advance Online Publication; laboratories of R. Jaenisch and K. Hochedlinger. 2009 Dec 13.
It can also be difficult for scientists to accurately identify which adult cells have been fully reprogrammed, and which are only partially reprogrammed. NIH-supported researchers now report development of a live cell imaging technique that enables scientists to sort partially and fully reprogrammed iPSCs. Chan et al.

French researchers generate skin from hESCsKeratinocytes are skin cells that make up approximately 95% of the outer layer of human skin, or epidermis. The epidermis is maintained and repaired by division of the keratinocyte stem cells. Acute burn victims are susceptible to infection and dehydration during their typical 3-week wait for expansion of their own (autologous) skin grafts. A new human embryonic stem cell (hESC) culturing technique developed in France mirrors the 40-day development of the epidermis in human embryos. The new culturing technique coaxes hESCs to generate keratinocyte stem cells (k-hESCs) that rapidly expand. K-hESCs derived this way may fulfill a critical window of need for severe burn victims awaiting autologous grafts. If they prove to be stable over the long term, k-hESC allografts may also help individuals with chronic genetic skin conditions where autologous grafts are not possible.

NIH-Funded Scientists Generate Haploid Human Gametes from Human Embryonic Stem CellsIn the developing embryo, human primordial germ cells divide to produce either sperm or eggs (gametes). Some birth defects and many forms of human infertility are thought to arise from problems with early gamete development. However, scientists have been unable to study early gamete development because it takes place before the human embryo is 2 weeks old. Now, NIH-funded scientists have identified 3 genes whose expression can be manipulated to drive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into becoming human primordial germ cells and then dividing to become haploid gametes. Although scientists have previously reported their ability to generate primordial germ cells, this laboratory is the first to report achievement of later stages of meiosis and development of haploid gametes. The ability to generate and study these cells in the laboratory will help scientists learn more about the cause of some birth defects, and to identify germ cell errors responsible for many forms of infertility. Nature 462:222–225; laboratory of R. Reijo Pera. 2009 Nov12.
Comparison of hESCs, iPSCs, and Adult CellsThe advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has led many to question the continuing need for research on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, the differences and similarities between iPSCs and hESCs have not been adequately explored to determine which may be more suitable for the future treatment of human disease. Epigenetic regulation of genes can change whether they are on or off without changing the DNA itself, and plays an important role in determining a cell’s characteristics. Scientists studying epigenetic regulation have typically focused on small cytosine and guanine-rich regions of DNA (""CpG islands"") believed to contain most of the alterations involved in gene activity states. NIH-funded scientists performed a genome-wide analysis of the epigenetic state of iPSC lines, their parent fibroblast cell lines, and several other cell types, including hESCs. There were several major findings from this work. 1) The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified by comparing iPSCs and fibroblasts were predominantly located in CpG island ""shores"" rather than in the islands themselves and were closely associated with genes that are important for pluripotency and developmental processes. 2) The methylation pattern of iPSCs and hESCs, while highly similar, were not completely equal, and may indicate that iPSCs occupy a potentially ""aberrant state"" between fully differentiated tissue (fibroblasts) and hESCs. 3) The DMRs involved in the epigenetic reprogramming to the pluripotent state greatly overlap with those in normal tissue development and aberrant programming of cancer. Future research will need to explore whether the noted differences between iPSCs, hESCs, and normal and cancerous tissues impact the potential clinical usefulness and practicality of customized reprogramming.

hESC Derivatives Help Spinal-Cord-Injured Rats Regain MobilityIndividuals who suffer spinal cord injuries (SCI) lose not only the nerve cells in the spinal cord, but also the supporting cells that insulate the spinal cord with myelin. Researchers supported in part by the Geron Corporation tested the ability of GRNOPC1, a proprietary hESC-derived population containing myelinating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), to restore mobility to rats with cervical spinal cord injuries. An earlier study demonstrated that injected OPCs enhanced remyelination and improved mobility in rats with thoracic SCI, but only in those rats injected at 7 days following injury, i.e., acute SCI. This study tested the same procedure in rats treated 7 days following cervical SCI. As in the earlier study, the OPCs migrated to the lesion site and enhanced remyelination, and treated rats demonstrated improved mobility. This report is being used to provide pre-clinical safety and efficacy data as the basis for approval of a clinical trial using Geron's OPCs to help individuals with acute injuries in either the cervical or thoracic spinal cord.

Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Able to Produce Live MiceIn the field of animal stem cell research, a stem cell's ability to produce a live mouse in a tetraploid complementation assay is the gold standard test for pluripotency. Until recently, only mouse embryonic stem cells had demonstrated this ability. Now, two groups of scientists in China report that they have reprogrammed adult mouse cells using the four pluripotency genes reported in the first mouse iPSC publication (see Scientists Reprogram Adult Mouse Skin Cells by Adding Defined Factors) and generated iPSC-derived embryos that survived gestation and were born alive after tetraploid complementation. One laboratory also demonstrated that an iPSC-generated male mouse was capable of impregnating a female and passing on its iPSC-derived characteristics. This research is an important demonstration that iPSCs are truly pluripotent. Nature 461(7260):86–90, laboratory of Q. Zhou, 2009 Sep 3; Cell Stem Cell 52:135–138, laboratory of S. Gao, 2009 July 23.
Cancer-destroying Cells Generated from Human Embryonic Stem CellsNatural Killer, or NK cells, are a specialized type of white blood cells that continuously patrol the body, eliminating cells that have become abnormal, such as cancer cells. In healthy individuals, NK cells eliminate cancerous cells before they can cause problems. In some individuals, however, their native NK cells are unable to eliminate all cancerous cells. NK cells generated from umbilical cord blood (UCB-NK cells) are already being used to treat individuals with cancer, but they are neither consistent nor efficient in destroying cancer cells. NIH-supported scientists at the University of Minnesota hope to generate a more potent version of NK cells for use in cancer therapies, and developed a way to coax human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to differentiate into NK cells. The scientists studied mice with human cancers to compare the cancer-destroying ability of hESC-derived NKs to the abilities of UCB-NK cells. They found that hESC-derived NKs were better than UCB-NKs at destroying both leukemia (blood cancer) and solid tumors, such as breast and prostate cancer. The hESC-derived NK cells not only destroyed human cancers in mice, but also protected them from recurrence and metastasis. Further studies will address whether other hESC lines are capable of generating such potent NK cells. This research marks an important advance for scientists working to understand how NK cells work and how they may be used to attack and destroy human cancers. Blood 113(24):6094-6101.

Human Corneal Stem Cells Repair Defective Corneas in MiceThe cornea helps to protect the eye from environmental irritants and serves as the eye's outermost lens, contributing between 65—75 percent of the eye's total focusing power. In most cases, scratches on the cornea caused by irritants or trauma can be repaired by the cornea's own stem cells. However, deeper scratches can cause corneal scarring, resulting in a haze on the cornea that can greatly impair vision. In this case, the cornea is unable to repair itself, and a corneal transplant may be needed. As with most transplant organs, corneas are in low supply. NIH-supported scientists transplanted stem cells from the adult human corneal stroma (cells that make up the transparent cornea) into the eyes of mice that exhibit corneal cloudiness. These mice's eyes lack the ability to produce a protein called lumican, which organizes the cornea's collagen in order to make it transparent. After injection of the human cornea stromal stem cells, the transparency of the treated corneas was comparable to those in mice with normal corneas. Treated mice did not reject the transplanted human cells. The scientists will now try to reproduce this result in animals with cornea scarring. If successful, the scientists may be able to develop a potential stem cell therapy for cornea scarring in humans. Stem Cells epub 2009; laboratory of J. Funderburgh.
Another Safety Improvement for Generating Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)Scientists funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the United Kingdom, and Canada reprogrammed mouse and human fibroblasts without using potentially dangerous viruses. For both types of fibroblasts, the reprogramming genes and an inducible transcription factor (can be used to turn expression on and off) were carried into the cells by naked DNA sequences. The naked DNA carriers also contained marking sequences that are targeted and ""cut out"" by specific enzymes. Using these special carriers, the scientists were able to insert reprogramming genes, turn them on for a specific period of time, and then remove the reprogramming genes and the transcription factor by adding the specific enzyme that zeroes in on and cuts out its targets. This method has several benefits: temporary expression of the reprogramming genes, the ability to remove inserted DNA after reprogramming is accomplished, use of a single carrier for all four reprogramming genes, and carriers' seeming increased resistantance to ""silencing,"" or being inactivated (which could explain the higher efficiency as compared to other non-viral carriers).
This method has some potential drawbacks. Insertion of the reprogramming factors is random and could still temporarily interfere with an important gene. Part of the carrier DNA is often left behind even after removal. The DNA cuts made at the DNA removal site are not always repaired correctly. The PiggyBac method used for some of the experiments employs a transposon, or ""jumping gene."" Jumping genes are known to cause human diseases such as muscular dystrophy or hemophilia, as well as increase susceptibility to cancer. The bottom line: These methods are another step toward improving our ability to reprogram cells and increasing our understanding of reprogramming. However, these methods could still pose a danger to human health if derivatives of these cells are used to treat humans. The cells generated by this method are a valuable research tool and provide useful means to screen drugs and establish human disease models in culture.

Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Working Heart Muscle CellsHeart transplants are done as a life-saving measure for end-stage heart failure when medical treatment and less drastic surgery have failed. Fortunately, most heart transplant recipients (about 90 percent) can come close to resuming their normal daily activities; however, donor hearts are in short supply. NIH-supported scientists have been able to grow heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). They compared cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). All cardiomyocytes in the study were derived using an embryoid body (EB) method. Both iPSC- and hESC-derived cardiomyocytes showed a reduction in gene expression for OCT4 and NANOG (known to regulate pluripotency) as they differentiated. However, pluripotency gene expression was more variable in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Both types of cardiomyocytes demonstrated heart muscle–specific characteristics, such as organized bands of contraction proteins, and electrical activity that causes them to spontaneously contract. Overall, the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are very similar to hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Due to the short supply of donor hearts for transplantation, these iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes may one day provide an important treatment for the substantial number of people with heart disease. By reprogramming their own skin cells into cardiomyocytes for repairing their heart muscle, patients can avoid the immune-suppressing drugs that accompany traditional heart transplant. Scientists also hope that the derived cardiomyocytes will be useful for testing potential drugs and for understanding the underlying cause of heart disease.

Sickle Cell Disease: Management and Cure
Bijal A. Parikh, MD, PhD
October 11, 2007
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is diagnosed in over 70,000 Americans, approaching an incidence of 1 in 400 live births in the African American population. The primary defect in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin is a mutation of glutamic acid to valine at position 6. If the mutation is inherited in the homozygous state, deoxygenated red blood cells become prone to �sickle� in the microcirculation. Sequelae associated with vaso-occlusive events include acute chest syndrome, multiple organ failure, priapism, stroke, infection, and death, with the median survival to the fifth decade. Of these morbidities, primary and secondary stroke prevention has been a goal of recent clinical trials.
The STOP and STOP II trials established several new clinical practice guidelines including screening children aged < 16 years with transcranial doppler ultrasound. Children with high flow rates in the MCA and distal ICA, indicating advanced stenosis, were found to have a 90% reduction in stroke incidence if blood transfusions were initiated, either through manual exchange or erythrocytopheresis, to maintain hemoglobin S less than 30%. However, the potential side effects of iron overload, allo-immunization, and transmission of blood-borne pathogens, still prove to be limiting, and thus not all patients at risk of primary stroke or recurrence benefit. This obstacle led to the development of alternatives to chronic transfusion, including hydroxyurea and stem cell transplantation.
The first successful hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for SCD was initiated in 1984. Since then, the preparative or conditioning regimen has been altered to be either completely myeloablative or partially ablative. Each of these therapies confer their own spectrum of adverse effects including infertility/sterility, neurotoxicity, lung and liver toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft rejection, and transplant related mortality (TRM). Additionally, donors have traditionally been restricted to matched related siblings, severely limiting the pool of potential recipients. Recently, clinicians at Washington University have begun to treat potential HSCT recipients with a partially myeloablative regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab. The trial accepts matched unrelated donors, expanding the pool of recipients who otherwise have no alternative. As studies such as this begin to address and ameliorate the immediate toxicities of HSCT, including GVHD and TRM, we can begin to offer transplantation as an alternative to chronic transfusion therapy and, look to its potential as an achievable cure for sickle cell disease.

Interview: Dr. Patricia Shi, Mt. Sinai Medical Center
Written by Craig Butler
Wednesday, 08 June 2011 20:03
June 8, 2011 - CAF speaks with Dr. Patricia A. Shi, who runs the adult hemoglobinopathy program at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York City. CAF: How many thalassemia patients are seen at the Mt Sinai thalassemia program?PS: We have always been known as one of the comprehensive sickle cell programs in New York City. We have not been traditionally known as a thalassemia program, however, so we currently have only a few patients, transferred from the pediatric program led by Dr. Anne Hurlet. The pediatric program sees about 8 patients currently. Dr. Patricia A. Shi CAF: How long have you been involved with the thalassemia program at Mt. Sinai? PS: I took over the sickle cell program in January of 2009 from one of my mentors, Dr. George Atweh, when he moved from Mt. Sinai to become chairman of the Hematology-Oncology division at University of Cincinnati. Previous to that, being dual-certified in Blood Banking and Hematology, I was working primarily in Transfusion Medicine as the director of cellular therapy collections for the bone marrow transplantation program. I have been at Mount Sinai since completing my post-doctoral training at the National Institutes of Health in 2002. CAF: How did you get interested in/involved in thalassemia?PS: Dr. Atweh was interested in thalassemia as well as sickle cell, and he sparked my interest. The two diseases are related in that they are both disorders that affect genes involved in hemoglobin production and cause anemia. Although the pathophysiology in these disorders is obviously very different, they share an increased risk for complications such as gallstones, thrombosis, osteoporosis, leg ulcers, gout, pulmonary hypertension, iron overload, and aplastic crises from parvovirus B19 infection. Currently available treatment options also overlap—those being transfusion, iron chelation, hydroxyurea, and bone marrow transplantation. Dr. Anne Hurlet CAF: Tell me more about the thalassemia program at Mt. Sinai. PS: Dr. Anne Hurlet and I direct the pediatric and adult patient programs, respectively, so patients seamlessly transition from one program to the other. To be cared for by hematologists specifically committed and interested in taking care of patients with thalassemia, which at the minimum means keeping up to date with the current literature in thalassemia, is important. That Mount Sinai is a tertiary care center is also important, because of the need to access advanced technologies and the expertise of other subspecialties in the care of patients with thalassemia. Mount Sinai has highly nationally ranked programs in endocrinology, cardiology, obstetrics/gynecology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, and nephrology that allow us to provide optimal care and coordination of care to patients. Lastly, our clinical dedication also extends to our basic research endeavors, where Dr. James Bieker, Dr. Ron Hoffman, and Dr .Anna Rita Migliaccio are carrying out laboratory investigations related to thalassemia. CAF: Who else comprises the thalassemia program staff at Mt. Sinai?PS: We were fortunate to recruit Jena Srivastava as the nurse practitioner for our program, specifically and solely to take care of our adult sickle cell and thalassemia patients. Our clinical program also has an excellent social worker, Meredith Ruden. On the basic research side, we have several investigators interested in thalassemia research. One is Dr. James Bieker, who is studying a class of molecules called peptide nucleic acids for their ability to increase hemoglobin F levels. Dr. Ron Hoffman is also exploring chromatin modifying agents such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors for their ability to increase Hb F. Both he and Dr. Anna Rita Migliaccio are studying the capacity of red cells grown in vitro to improve transfusion therapy for patients with thalassemia. We eventually hope to translate these laboratory-based research endeavors into clinical trials. CAF: Is the program able to offer access to R2 and/or T2* technology? PS: The program has on-site access to liver and cardiac MRIs using T2/T2* technology to accurately assess iron burden under the leadership of Dr. Bachir Taouli and Dr. Javier Sanz in the Division of Radiology and Cardiology, respectively. Dr. Gustavo Del Toro CAF: Can you tell me about the Mt. Sinai’s experience with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and thalassemia? PS: We have an active bone marrow transplant program in thalassemia under the leadership of Dr. Gustavo Del Toro for pediatric patients. Since arriving to Mount Sinai in 2000, Dr. Del Toro has performed four unrelated cord blood transplants, in two patients with β-thalassemia major and two with HbE/β-thalassemia. The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 5 years of age, and all have been cured of their disease and are doing well. We also have an active adult program in bone marrow transplantation under the leadership of Dr. Luis Isola, but we have not transplanted any adults with thalassemia due to the high morbidity and mortality risk. We hope to participate in gene therapy trials in the near future. CAF: Are there any thalassemia-related clinical trials in which Mt. Sinai is currently involved?PS: Because of our currently small patient numbers, we do not have any treatment trials active. We do have an ongoing laboratory-based trial with Dr. Barry Coller, looking at levels of platelet activation in thalassemia patients, in order to better understand the increased thrombosis risk in thalassemia. This simply requires an extra tube of blood to be drawn at the time of the routine blood draw with their clinic visit. As our clinic numbers expand, however, we will certainly open up new trials. Some of the trials that we plan to pursue, as I mentioned, involve reducing red cell alloimmunization and transfusion frequency and increasing HbF levels. We are also interested in gene therapy trials in collaboration with Dr. Michel Sadelain. CAF: What else would you like to share?PS: We hope to expand the hours of clinic to include evening hours once a week, in order to better accommodate the lifestyles of our patients. This reflects our commitment to providing the best standard of clinical care for patients with thalassemia and also raising these standards by developing improved and novel therapies.

Treatment
Call your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room if you develop a fever, a productive cough that causes you to bring up mucus, abdominal pain, vomiting, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, or any difficulty breathing. Fever, chest pain, and cough are symptoms of the acute chest syndrome, which is sometimes fatal. The acute chest syndrome can be caused by an infection or by sickled cells that become trapped in the lungs. It can lead to long-term breathing difficulties, and often occurs after surgery. Patients who develop any of these symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately.
If bone pain is severe, go to the emergency room; doctors may administer opioids such as morphine to provide relief.
Seek medical treatment for priapism that lasts longer than six hours and does not resolve with conservative self care. Self care involves applying ice packs, drinking fluids, and taking pain medication. If this is not effective, doctors may treat prolonged priapism with drugs or with transfusion. Surgery is sometimes necessary. Research into nonsurgical methods of treatment is ongoing.
Always tell your provider about all medical conditions, especially sickle cell anemia; otherwise, the doctor could unknowingly prescribe a medication that could bring on a crisis.
Try to avoid exposure to anything that could reduce oxygen levels or decrease circulation, such as smoking, infections, exhaustion, dehydration, high altitudes, cold temperatures, or changes in temperature. Drink plenty of fluids, especially when exercising or in hot weather. Doctors recommend eight 12-ounce glasses of fluid per day in warm weather. Do not smoke, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Exercise in moderation, avoiding strenuous routines. Avoid cold temperatures, and dress warmly when in cold places, including air-conditioned rooms. Do not swim in cold water. Only fly in commercial airplanes. Private planes often do not have pressurized cabins, and flying in an unpressurized cabin can cause low oxygen levels in the blood. Avoid travel to altitudes above 10,000 feet, including mountain climbing.
If stress triggers a sickle cell crisis, stress management programs, which teach new ways to handle frustrating situations, may be helpful.
Avoid exposure to people with colds or other contagious diseases, and notify your doctor if you get sick.
Follow your doctor's dietary recommendations. Well-balanced, nutritious meals, such as those suggested by the US Department of Agriculture, are usually recommended. Good nutrition can help keep the body healthy and decrease the likelihood of infection. Doctors may recommend limiting intake of caffeine and alcohol, which can contribute to dehydration and may increase the risk for a crisis.
Any type of surgical procedure that requires general anesthetic, including dental work, should be done in the hospital.
Contact your primary care doctor before undergoing any dental procedure that requires use of nitrous oxide.
Rest, stay warm, drink additional fluids, and take recommended medications during episodes of pain.
Heating pads, a warm bath, or massage may help to relieve the pain. Do not use a heating pad for more than 20 minutes. Do not lie on a heating pad. Always place a towel between your body and the heat source.
Self-hypnosis, distraction, and other non-drug interventions can decrease the perception of pain or take your mind off the discomfort.
Support from family and friends may help you cope with the condition. You may also benefit from participating in a support group.
If you develop priapism, apply ice packs, drink fluids, and take pain medication. If the condition does not resolve within six hours, seek medical care. Ice should be applied for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Always place a towel between skin and ice.
Your doctor is the best source of information on the drug treatment choices available to you.
During a sickle cell crisis, doctors will increase a patient's fluid intake, either by encouraging the patient to drink or by giving fluids through a vein. By increasing fluid intake, doctors can treat or prevent dehydration, which often causes crises or makes them worse. If patients are vomiting or unable to drink, intravenous fluids will be ordered. A catheter may be inserted into the bladder to help the medical team monitor fluid output.
Oxygen may be ordered for patients whose oxygen levels are low, but it is not effective against sickle cell anemia itself and is not routinely administered.
Blood transfusions may be needed. Transfusions increase the number of normal blood cells circulating in the patient. Blood transfusions may be effective during infections or when blood collects in the spleen during a sequestration crisis. Heart rate, blood pressure, bleeding, and hemoglobin levels help doctors determine when a transfusion may be needed.
An exchange blood transfusion may be ordered during a stroke or other serious crisis. During an exchange blood transfusion, the patient's red blood cells are replaced with donated red blood cells. The goal of an exchange transfusion is to decrease the amount of hemoglobin S in the patient's blood. Long-term exchange treatments in children with sickle cell anemia—associated strokes can decrease the chance of additional strokes.
Special breathing exercises may be ordered for patients with acute chest syndrome. The incentive spirometer, a plastic tube containing a ball, is a simple device that can help train the patient to breathe deeply. The goal is to make the ball rise in the tube. To accomplish this, the patient must take deep breaths and breathe hard into the tube. Deep breathing can help ward off some of the lung complications associated with the acute chest syndrome.
Physical therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may help relieve the pain.
Bone marrow transplantation may be possible for patients who are not responding well to conventional care. Although bone marrow transplantation provides the possibility of a cure, 5% to 10% of patients who receive transplants from matched family members die. Therefore, the procedure is considered only for patients with a poor prognosis, those who have had a stroke, those whose pain cannot be relieved by medication, or those who repeatedly experience the acute chest syndrome. Additional research is being conducted in hopes of decreasing the high death rate associated with bone marrow transplantation.
Psychological counseling may help patients deal with the emotional aspects of having a chronic, painful, life-threatening disease.
Doctors are investigating gene therapy as a cure for sickle cell anemia, but it is not yet available to patients.
In general, surgery is not used to treat sickle cell anemia; however, it may be indicated to treat specific complications. Laser surgery may be needed to help prevent additional loss of vision particularly in those with sickle C disease. Patients who develop other complications may also need other types of surgery, such as gallstone removal or hip replacement. Leg ulcers may require treatment with skin grafts.
Pregnant women with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for a crisis and other complications. Sickle cell anemia can become more severe during pregnancy. Women with sickle cell disease are more likely to have low birth-weight babies and to go into labor early. Good prenatal care can decrease the mother's risk for death. Years ago, 33% of pregnant women with sickle cell anemia died. Today, in areas with good prenatal care, the mortality rate is only 1.6%.
Women with sickle cell anemia should make informed decisions about reproductive issues, and should consult a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant to discuss the chances of passing the disease to a child.
Pregnant women with sickle cell anemia have a greater risk for losing their babies through spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) than women who do not suffer from the condition.
Patients with sickle cell trait have a normal life expectancy.
Prognosis for patients with sickle cell anemia has improved. Years ago, it was rare for patients to survive past childhood. Now, patients who receive good modern care, follow their doctors' advice, and monitor their health often live to be 40 to 50 years of age. It is important for patients to do everything they can to avoid acute sickle cell crises, which can result in death. Kidney or respiratory failure is often the cause of death in 40- to 50-year-old patients, and infections are the most common cause of death in children.
The number of crises per year affects prognosis. Because sickle cell crises can cause organ damage and other problems, patients who have fewer crises often have better prognoses. The median age at death is 35 years for patients with three or more episodes per year. However, patients with fewer annual episodes often survive into their fifties.
Patients with sickle cell anemia should receive regular check-ups. Annual blood tests and a urine exam are typically ordered. As patients grow older, they may develop more complications and may need more frequent follow-ups with the doctor.
Patients should contact the doctor for every major sickle cell crisis and for symptoms of any complications, such as stroke, priapism, gallstones, eye problems, and leg ulcers.
Patients should see an eye doctor regularly to monitor for eye-related complications.

Cure for Lower Back Pain - Natural Relief through Exercise
Are you seeking a natural cure for lower back pain or back ache?
Lower back pain can be one of the most uncomfortable feelings that you will ever have to deal with. It’s like your whole center hurts and isn’t strong enough to hold you up.

A note about Cure for Lower Back Pain - Natural Relief through Exercise
In natural health and healing, we believe in holistic health and healing, as we realize that different parts of the human body are highly interlinked, often beyond Man's understanding. We also believe that the body has the ability to heal itself of any disease, even supposedly incurable diseases.
In order to do so, the body needs the support of some basic dietary and lifestyle good health habits, such as a full body detox and a proper understanding and application of nutrition. No matter how remote or unrelated a health condition may seem, these fundamental health steps will greatly magnify the effects and benefits of any of our health-promoting efforts, including the use of specific natural health remedies.
Women who are pregnant will often experience lower back pain. Another common cause of lower back pain in women is cramping during menstruation. While these are temporary causes of lower back pain, there are many other causes of pain in that part of the body.
Importance of a Strong Core
While you should know that eating healthy and taking the proper supplements will help you to build strong bones and muscle, perhaps the best cure for lower back pain is to make sure that your body is strong - this is referring to your core muscles, or the deep abdominal muscles that hold your belly in without you having to do anything.
When you have a strong core, you will be better able to support your back. Also, with a strong core, your posture will improve, and this will help to function as a cure for lower back pain.
Your core is what keeps you balanced and held erect. Core muscles work in conjunction with your back and surface abdominal muscles to help stabilize the body and offer strength to the back.
If you have ever looked at someone who can stand straight with one leg in the air and have no balancing problems at all and wondered how they do it, you have been watching a strong core in action. Think ballerina on this one.
While many people who have strong cores typically have enviable stomachs, you really should focus on the health benefits first and the aesthetics second, but believe me, you will see results with core strengthening exercises.
Start Slow
So, where do you start in this quest for a cure for lower back pain?
Well, if you’re currently suffering from lower back pain, the first step is to work slowly to relieve the pain and heal your back. There are lots of very beneficial stretching exercises that will help to ease your back pain.
The duration for which you should carry out these exercises before you start strengthening your core will likely depend, so you should talk to your medical professional and, more importantly, listen to your body. You should not ever begin working on difficult core exercises if you are still nursing a back injury.
Pilates
Consider doing Pilates as a possible cure for lower back pain, to help heal your back. In addition to the core strengthening work that this type of exercise provides, Pilates will also help you to improve your posture and stretch your body, making it a nearly ideal work out.
Many Pilates instructors are now professionally trained specifically to help you heal and strengthen your back, so you will need to seek out a Pilates instructor who has been trained in this aspect of the exercise. With Pilates, a natural cure for lower back pain may just be close at hand.
Conclusion
Remember that you know your body best, and with the help of a professional who knows how to help you heal and strengthen without doing your body more harm, you can cure your lower back pain. Don’t be afraid to try new things, but listen to how your back feels and never overdo it.

Natural Course of Low Back Pain
Natural Course of Low Back Pain
Almost 800 adults participated in this study of low back pain (LBP). There were two goals:
Observe the natural course of LBP over five years
See if people who exercise recover faster than those who don't
There aren't very many studies to follow the natural history or course of LBP beyond the first two years. The natural course of a condition or illness describes what happens over time.
In this study, pain and disability were the main measures used to compare men and women with LBP. Patients were also asked about physical activity including physical exercise, sports, and leisure activities. The patients were divided into three groups based on intensity and duration of exercise reported. The groups were low exercise, medium exercise, and high exercise.
The researchers found that compared to women, men had lower intensity pain at the time of the initial back pain incident. Women in the high-exercise group also had lower pain compared to the low or medium exercise grops. Women in the medium exercise group tend to have more pain, which keeps them from exercising more.
Both sexes had the same amount of disability. Most of the improvements in pain and function occurred in the first six months. The authors concluded that the natural history of LBP is about the same for men and women. Regular exercise (not specific back exercises) doesn't seem to help speed up recovery.

Circumcision status and risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men: a meta-analysis.
Millett GA, Flores SA, Marks G, Reed JB, Herbst JH
Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd, Mail Stop E-37, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. gmillett@cdc.gov
CONTEXT: Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that male circumcision reduces men's risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during heterosexual intercourse. Less is known about whether male circumcision provides protection against HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively summarize the strength of the association between male circumcision and HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) across observational studies of MSM. DATA SOURCES: Comprehensive search of databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Sociofile, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and correspondence with researchers, to find published articles, conference proceedings, and unpublished reports through February 2008. STUDY SELECTION: Of 18 studies that quantitatively examined the association between male circumcision and HIV/STI among MSM, 15 (83%) met the selection criteria for the meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent abstraction was conducted by pairs of reviewers using a standardized abstraction form. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 53,567 MSM participants (52% circumcised) were included in the meta-analysis. The odds of being HIV-positive were nonsignificantly lower among MSM who were circumcised than uncircumcised (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.13; number of independent effect sizes [k] = 15). Higher study quality was associated with a reduced odds of HIV infection among circumcised MSM (beta, -0.415; P = .01). Among MSM who primarily engaged in insertive anal sex, the association between male circumcision and HIV was protective but not statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-2.22; k = 4). Male circumcision had a protective association with HIV in studies of MSM conducted before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.69; k = 3). Neither the association between male circumcision and other STIs (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.26; k = 8), nor its relationship with study quality was statistically significant (beta, 0.265; P = .47). CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analyses of available observational studies of MSM revealed insufficient evidence that male circumcision protects against HIV infection or other STIs. However, the comparable protective effect of male circumcision in MSM studies conducted before the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, as in the recent male circumcision trials of heterosexual African men, supports further investigation of male circumcision for HIV prevention among MSM.

A case of medical colonialism?: South African Medical Journal condemns HIV-circumcision push
In a hard hitting editorial that raises the spectre of neocolonialism, the South African Medical Journal has condemned the push for mass circumcision of African men as the solution to the nation’s HIV-AIDS problem. The editorial, by the journal editor Professor Daniel Ncayiyana, reviews the evidence for the claim that circumcision reduces the risk of female-to-male infection, and finds it less conclusive than assumed (and far less significant than regularly proclaimed in sensationalist newspaper headlines). Instead of taking the risky and expensive surgical road, the editorial urges South Africa to follow the recommendation of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, which has rejected circumcision and reiterated that “correct and consistent condom use … is the most effective means of reducing female-to-male transmission, and vice-versa.”
For a full report, see the Africa page.
USA: Medical benefits for circumcision may be unlawful
Payments for non-therapeutic (medically unnecessary) circumcision by the United States health insurance scheme Medicaid violate the protocols for payments under this program and may thus be unlawful. This is the startling conclusion of an article by US legal expert Peter Adler in a leading law journal in December 2011. The article shows that the federal and state Medicaid acts stipulate that physicians and patients can use Medicaid to pay for medical services only when they are clinically necessary. This provision clearly excludes non-essential medical services, such as cosmetic surgery, and some states expressly exclude cosmetic surgery from the list of covered treatments. In addition, federal and state Medicaid law require diagnosis of a medical condition and recommendation of an effective treatment before any benefit is payable. Even then, surgery is permitted only as a last resort.
Since the vast majority of circumcision procedures subsidized by Medicare are of normal male infants and boys who are not suffering from any sort of pathological condition that requires surgery or any other medical treatment, it follows that most circumcision procedures violate the Medicaid guidelines and hence that the resulting payments are unlawful. American medical associations have concede that circumcision is not merely unnecessary, but that it is usually performed for religious, cultural, personal, or even cosmetic reasons (so that the boy “looks like his father”). It is estimated that between 50 and 100 million boys have been circumcised in the United States since the introduction of Medicaid in 1965, at a cost of several billion dollars. Although 18 of the 50 states have dropped circumcision from their schedule of covered treatments, it follows that a high proportion of this money has been expended unlawfully.
The article concludes that it is not within the discretion of the US federal government or the other 32 states to continue Medicaid coverage of circumcision merely because they wish to do so or because they think that circumcision is a matter of parental choice. The law is clear: Medicaid payments for non-therapeutic circumcision must cease.

Circumcision and HIV prevention: New study slams flaws in African clinical trials
A new review of those three famous Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) of circumcision in Africa slams the claim that they prove that circumcision significantly reduces the risk of men contracting HIV/AIDS during unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected female partner. While the risk reduction achieved by circumcision has commonly been reported as “60 per cent”, the paper points out that this is merely relative risk, and that the absolute risk reduction is much lower - a miserable 1.3 per cent. Even the relative risk reduction (49 per cent) appears to have been exaggerated. Just as seriously, there appears to have been a 60 per cent relative increase in the risk of male to female HIV transmission when the male partner is circumcised. The authors of the paper argue that circumcision is still unproven as an effective means of HIV prevention, and that - given the expense, the risk of complications, the damage to sexual function and the danger of human rights and ethical abuses - it should not be deployed on the massive scale that we are witnessing.
The review, in the December 2011 edition of the Journal of Law and Medicine, is by independent research consultant, Professor Gregory J Boyle of Bond University, Queensland, and George Hill, a consultant with the American group, Doctors Opposing Circumcision.
For full details, see the Africa page.
Infant male circumcision is genital mutilation
An article in the British newspaper, The Guardian, argues that men should have the right to choose circumcision, not have the choice forced upon them:
There are still many people who like to pretend that infant circumcision and genital mutilation are not the same thing. Some of them apparently work at Indonesia’s health ministry, the Departemen Kesehatan, who recently issued guidelines for “safe” female circumcision and wheeled out a spokeswoman to dispense the following words of wisdom: “I would like to stress that female circumcision is not genital mutilation, which is indeed dangerous. They are two things that are very different.”
The same attitude is widespread in Britain. Thousands of people believe, against all logic and reason, that male infant circumcision is somehow not genital mutilation. Mutilation is a loaded term, so let me be clear what I mean. I don’t mean that circumcision is mutilation. If consenting adults want to modify their bodies by snipping a bit off here or adding a bit there, then that's their right, and beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder. Infant circumcision is a completely different matter. Infant circumcision involves performing surgery without consent to permanently alter an individual’s genitals. … Just as we call sex without consent “rape”, circumcision without consent or reasonable justification should be called “mutilation”.
Circumcision of infants or children without an immediate medical requirement is an unjustified violation of basic human rights.
For full text, see Martin Robbins, Infant male circumcision is genital mutilation, The Guardian, 6 December 2001
Not a surgical vaccine: Circumcision not appropriate for HIV control in Australia
A paper in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health argues that circumcision of baby boys has no place among HIV control measures in Australia. Researchers Robert Darby and Robert Van Howe said that there was nothing in the results of the African circumcision trials to justify circumcision as an HIV control measure in developed countries, nor to warrant circumcision of infants rather than adult men. “Quite apart from the ethical problem, today’s infants would not be at risk of any sexually transmitted infection until they become sexually active in 16-20 years time. By then both prevention and treatment options, as well as the virus itself, may well have changed beyond recognition”, Dr Darby said.
In their paper the authors reviewed recent suggestions that widespread circumcision of male infants be introduced in Australia as a means of combating heterosexually transmitted HIV infection. They found them flawed in several crucial areas. These include doubts about the African trials themselves, their relevance to Australia, the risks and harm of circumcision, and issues relating to informed consent and human rights. They also criticised the notion of circumcision as a “surgical vaccine” as unscientific and irresponsible from a public health point of view. “Such an exaggerated claim is likely to encourage high-risk behaviour”, Dr Darby said.
The proposals under review were largely inspired by three clinical trials in Africa. But Dr Darby said the public health situation is dramatically different in a wealthy, developed nation such as Australia. “There is no heterosexual HIV epidemic in Australia that would justify a costly, authoritarian program on the scale suggested,” he said. “On the contrary, our analysis supports the conclusion of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, in its policy statement on circumcision, that routine circumcision is not appropriate in the Australian and New Zealand context.”

Conference report: Law, human rights, and non-therapeutic interventions on children
A conference titled, “Law, Human Rights, and Non-Therapeutic Interventions on Children,” was held on 31 August – 1 September at the University of Keele, UK. Speakers from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands and Australia covered all aspects of non-therapeutic surgery on children’s genitals, including male circumcision, female genital cutting (mutilation), and intersex children (i.e. babies born with ambiguous genitalia). The conference organizers, including David Smith of Genital Autonomy Eu and Michael Thomson, professor of Law at the University of Keele, took a very creative approach, bringing together grass-roots anti-circumcision and child protection activists with academics and officials not necessarily associated with direct advocacy. All participants felt that the event was ""a smashing success"", marking a new phase in the struggle for recognition of the rights of children to bodily integrity.

Economists slam African circumcision programs
In recent months the African circumcision programs have come under strong attack from leading economists, who warn that the programs are not cost effective and are distorting the health budgets of recipient countries. The circumcision programs were introduced after three clinical trials appeared to show that circumcision could reduce a male’s risk of acquiring HIV through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected female partner. The degree of risk reduction is estimated by the authoritative Cochrane Review as somewhere between 38% and 66% – which has not prevented circumcision advocates and an uncritical media from bandying a mythical “60 per cent protection” as though it was the same thing as immunity. The excessive stress on HIV control, and within this on circumcision as the best tactic, is criticised in a paper by Michael Grimm and Deena Cass, published by the German Development Bank; while Bjorn Lomborg and economists at the Copenhagen Consensus Center have criticised the African circumcision programs as too expensive, and far less effective than cheaper interventions that have the additional advantages of being both less risky and less controversial.

Men circumcised as children at greater risk of HIV
A study in Mozambique has found that men circumcised as children are 2 or 3 time more likely to be infected with HIV than uncircumcised men. The study, by Dr D.D. Brewer, confirms earlier research in Kenya, Lesotho and Tanzania that young people without sexual experience were more likely to be HIV-positive if they had been circumcised or if they had gone through traditional cutting rituals such as scarification. The results confirm the argument of David Gisselquist and others that a significant number of African AIDS cases are not the result of heterosexual intercourse, but of non-sterile medical procedures. The increasing evidence of non-sexual transmission of HIV casts further doubt on the value of mass circumcision campaigns as the magic bullet against AIDS.

Zambia: Another study fails to find that foreskins increase risk of HIV
A study of the possible link between genital herpes and increased risk of HIV in Zambia did find that men with herpes were more likely to be HIV-positive, but also found that lack of circumcision did not increase the risk of HIV infection. Quite the contrary, the study found that uncircumcised men were less likely to contract HIV. In their discussion of the results, however, the authors of the study failed to mention this vital fact, and concluded by recommending that circumcision be promoted as an AIDS control strategy – thus violating the most basic principles of evidence-based medicine.

Cutting through the myths of circumcision
Further evidence that intelligent Americans are rejecting and abandoning circumcision is provided in a September issue of the on-line journal Psychology Today, which has published a series of articles tackling common myths about the foreskin and circumcision. In one of these articles Dr Darcia Narverez considers the perennial issues of hygiene, cleanliness and sexually transmitted diseases.

Australia: Rising demand for female circumcision
An article in the February edition the Medical Journal of Australia warns against the rising demand for female circumcision. The article, by law professor Dr Ben Mathews, calls for increased protection of girls and women from this danger. The demand is generated by recent immigrants from Middle Eastern and African countries where circumcision of girls and boys is a common customary or cultural practice. As more immigrants arrive from these places, the demand for circumcision of young girls is rising along with the demand for circumcision of young boys. Female circumcision (also known as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or female genital cutting) refers to a wide range of procedures in which parts of the external female genitalia are cut off to satisfy culturally determined requirements of chastity, cleanliness, and aesthetics. FGM is often practiced in poor sanitary conditions, leading to significant complications

Melbourne: Sailor sues over circumcision injury
A FORMER sailor who was circumcised without consent and against his will by a ship's doctor and suffered ridicule from his shipmates is seeking compensation almost 40 years after the operation. He woke during the operation and had to be physically restrained while it was completed, according to evidence to a tribunal. The attendant holding him down then joked his foreskin would make good fish bait.
The Melbourne man, 56, is seeking a $28,600 a year defence force pension because he claims his severe depression that emerged after the circumcision was caused by his defence service. The Repatriation Commission rejected his claim, despite its own expert diagnosing the man, known only as DZLG, as suffering a ""generalised anxiety disorder"" because of the ridicule after the operation. But the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled the commission was wrong and recommended the man be given a pension.
The man was 19 when he was posted on HMAS Sydney in 1973 and attended sick bay with a sore penis, the tribunal was told. He had expected to receive an antiseptic cream but instead was circumcised and he told the tribunal the operation ""just happened"" and he had no time to object. A medical attendant ""held the removed foreskin in tongs and joked about using it for fishing"", he said. The man fainted and spent four days in sick bay, then his shipmates started taunting him. “Jokes were made referring to the size of his penis . . . he was called names,” the tribunal found. When he transferred to another ship the taunts continued and he became depressed, alienated and lonely, the tribunal found.
His lawyer, Greg Isolani of KCI Lawyers, said the bullying affected the sailor for the rest of his life, leaving him a ""shattered man"". He said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the Department of Veterans' Affairs forced him to appeal to a tribunal.

Circumcision of male infants and boys: The rising tide of doubt
In recent months there has been a spate of articles in the United States, British and even Australian media on the pros and cons of circumcising non-consenting male infants and boys, but the predominant sentiment in these essays has been doubt and rejection. No matter what ""health benefits"" circumcision may provide in later life, it is increasingly recognised that such a radical surgical operation is not necessary for the well-being of children, and is not ethically permissible if performed on a person without his informed consent.
Is there such a thing as male circumcision?
It is common to hear the phrase male circumcision (abbreviated to MC by those who do not really want to think about the realities of surgery on the most sensitive part of the male body), but the truth is that there is no such thing as male circumcision. People also speak of circumcision as a ""valid procedure"" - but what on earth could such an absurd expression mean? It's like saying that sexual intercourse is a valid procedure. I suppose it means that circumcision is a justified or justifiable operation, but the truth of that claim will depend on context: it may be justifiable to perform the operation on adults who have given informed consent, and even on children who cannot give consent in situations of therapeutic necessity (i.e. to correct a pathology that has not responded to conservative treatment); and it is arguable that it is justifiable where the parents are devout, conscientious, practising adherents of a religion that holds that children must be circumcised. Like sexual intercourse, it all depends on the context: with the consent of a person above the legal age of consent, sexual intercourse is justifiable; without consent, or if the person is below the statutory age, it is sexual assault or rape. There is no reason why the rules for permanent bodily alterations, particularly in such a physically and psychologically sensitive area should be less strict than the rules for sexual activity. In fact, the expression ""male circumcision"" is meaningless: there is no such thing as male circumcision, only circumcision of males in a variety of contexts, some of which are justifiable, some of which may be justifiable, and some of which are definitely not justifiable. Without specifying the context you cannot say whether the operation is ""valid"" or not.
On a new page we reprint a range of recent critiques of ""male circumcision"" as commonly understood - that is, medically unnecessary circumcision of male infants or boys. These are humans with inherent human rights, who have not given their consent to such a dramatic alteration of their body. Read the articles here.
Circumcised men at equal risk of HPV infection
A large-scale study at the University of Washington has found no difference in the incidence of HPV infection between circumcised and uncircumcised male college students. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) is a large group of viruses that may cause genital warts, and are implicated in the genesis of genital cancers. HPV is very common among the sexually active population. but most people never show any symptoms. The risk factors for the development of cancer have been shown to be numerous different sexual partners and smoking. The new study confirmed previous research which showed that the location of the virus differed between circumcised and uncircumcised men: circumcised men tend to carry the virus on the shaft skin of the penis, while intact men are more likely to carry it on the glans. The study also also found that circumcised men have more sexual partners. In a previous study the researchers found found that for college females the circumcision status of their partner was NOT a risk factor for HPV infection in women. The authors comment that the African Random Clinical Trials, which seemed to show that uncircumcised men were more likely to carry the HPV virus, were seriously flawed because they took samples only from the glans (not from the shaft skin, where the virus is concentrated in the circumcised).
ABSTRACT
Background: The role of circumcision in male HPV acquisition is not clear.
Methods: Male university students (aged 18–20 years) were recruited from 2003 to 2009 and followed up triannually. Shaft/scrotum, glans, and urine samples were tested for 37  human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate the association between circumcision and HPV acquisition. Logistic regression was used to assess whether the number of genital sites infected at incident HPV detection or site of incident detection varied by circumcision status.
Results: In 477 men, rates of acquiring clinically relevant HPV types (high-risk types plus types 6 and 11) did not differ significantly by circumcision status (hazard ratio for uncircumcised relative to circumcised subjects: 0.9 [95% confidence interval{CI}: 0.7–1.2]). However, compared with circumcised men, uncircumcised men were 10.1 (95% CI: 2.9 –35.6) times more likely to have the same HPV type detected in all 3 genital specimens than in a single genital specimen and were 2.7 (95% CI: 1.6–4.5) times more likely to have an HPV-positive urine or glans specimen at first detection.
Conclusion: We found no differences by circumcision status in overall HPV acquisition or in number of HPV types acquired. Findings held for all clinically relevant HPV types, as well as for the subgroups of high-risk types, high-risk -9 types, and HPV-16. This observation is consistent with findings from other longitudinal studies.
Bottom line: Circumcision does not lower the risk of infection with Human Papilloma Virus. People who claim that uncircumcised men are more likely to develop or communicate genital cancers are ignoring the facts and spreading misleading information.

Foreskin restoration: New regenerative medical technologies offer hope to circumcised men
For men deprived of and missing their foreskin - either because it was taken without their consent when they were babies, or because they made a big mistake as an adult - there have been only two ways to cope with the loss: grin and bear it (and maybe not admit that there was a loss, like the fox who lost his tail), or attempt restoration by slowly stretching the remnant foreskin tissue. In the early years A.D. this method was used by young Jewish men who wanted to appear uncircumcised and thus take a greater part in Hellenic social life; but the method was slow, and would work well only if there was a fairly large quantity of foreskin tissue left to stretch. Men who had suffered a really tight circumcision had a far more difficult and often impossible task.
But recent advances in regenerative medical techniques are now offering hope that it may be possible to regrow the foreskin, nerves and all, and restore it to something like what it would have been naturally. It is only an idea as yet, but similar techniques using stem cells have been successfully used to regrow some internal organs, and there are reports of successful vaginal reconstructions using similar methods. For the present the organisation behind the initiative, Foregen, is seeking to raise funds for further research and a pilot program. Where is the Gates Foundation when you need it? After providing hundreds of millions of dollars to circumcise Africans, the least it could do is offer a few hundred thousand to repair the damage. After all, when the HIV crisis is over and AIDS can be prevented or cured, many of those men may want their foreskins back.
IntactNews recently interviewed Vincenzo Aiello, the founder of Foregen, a non-profit organization raising funds for foreskin regeneration using the latest regenerative medicine technologies. Foregen’s ambition is to provide foreskin regeneration surgeries for men who were circumcised without their consent. Read the full interview here.
Australia: Circumcision rate continues its slow decline
Contrary to recent, ignorant, media reports, the incidence of infant circumcision in Australia is not increasing, but, on the contrary, is static nationally and actually declining in most states and territories. This is the conclusion of an analysis of circumcision figures for the period 2000-2010, published in the August issue of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health. The article compared the Medicare rebate for circumcision of boys under 6 months with male birth statistics, concluding that the incidence of circumcision had stayed pretty steady at 12 per cent across the nation, but with big falls in some states, offset by small rises in others.
The most striking feature of the figures is wide variation among the states – from a low of 1.5 per cent in Tasmania to a high of 17.3 per cent in New South Wales for 2010. In between are the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia on 6 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively, and South Australia and Queensland on 15.1 and 14 per cent. Another feature of the figures are the sharp falls in Tasmania, from 9.3 per cent in 2000 to 1.5 per cent in 2010; in the Northern Territory from 7.6 to 2.7 per cent; and in Queensland from 20.3 per cent to 14 per cent. There have been small rises over the same period in Victoria (5.3% to 8%) and New South Wales (14.3% to 17%), though these may well be a product of changes in hospital policy rather than evidence of increased demand for the operation.
The article suggests that the rises in NSW and Victoria may be related to the decision by state governments (NSW in 2006, Vic and SA in 2007) to cease providing non-therapeutic (medically unnecessary) circumcision as a service in their public hospitals. This may have resulted in a shift in the provider of the service from hospitals (where no Medicare rebate is payable or recorded) to GPs and specialist clinics, where the procedure shows up in the Medicare statistics. The rise may thus be more apparent than real. The article wonders why Medicare is providing a rebate for circumcision, considering that the latest statement by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians does not recommend it or regard it as necessary, and the Medicare guidelines state that rebates are not available for “medical services which are not clinically necessary”. The article concludes that there is no evidence for recent assertions that “circumcision is back in favour”, and points out that, on the contrary, it is continuing its slow decline from the high-point of the mid-1950s, and is close to its lowest level for nearly a century.

New leaflet on foreskin care wins applause
Several viewers of this website have written in to commend the new leaflet, Circumcision and foreskin care: Guide for parents, saying it is the most sensible and thorough outline of the subject they have seen. One letter is from David Priestly*, a man in his late 60s, father of three sons, none of whom was circumcised, who received advice on how to care for his own foreskin from his father, who in turn was taught by his father ... and so on. The letter displays a wealth of experience and good sense on the habits of the foreskin and the sort of care that will keep it happy, problem free and in good working order, as well as advice on how to handle the minor problems that may arise from time to time, not to mention a lively sense of the importance of the foreskin for body image and sexual pleasure. There is a lost world of secret men's business here, where knowledge of the body was passed down the family from father to son. (*Name changed for privacy reasons.)

Boy awarded $4.6 million for circumcision injury
Los Angeles, USA: A boy has been awarded damages of $4.6 million for injuries suffered during a routine circumcision procedure when he was a week old. The boy will need yearly visits to a pediatric urologist and will continue to obtain psychiatric care to deal with the trauma of this incident and resultant surgeries. In addition, future surgery may be required as he grows older. The lawyer for the family said that the case was “one of the most extraordinary” in which he had been involved, and that the victory offered benefits for society and other families: “In the process of this litigation, we also have exposed a danger to children which we hope to eradicate by the effects of this litigation and settlement.” The boy’s mother, a single parent with one other son, said she hoped this case would help to prevent this sort of tragedy from happening to anyone else and that that warnings would be given to people about what could happen.

“Unethical and illegal”: South African Medical association rejects circumcision of infants
In a letter dated 23 June 2011, the South African Medical Association has stated that it does not support the practice of circumcision of infants as a means of preventing HIV transmission and that it considers circumcision of infants to be both unethical and illegal. The letter was signed by Ms Ulundi Behrtel, Chairperson of the Human Rights, Law and Ethics Committee. The full text of the letter follows:
23 June 2011
Mr Dean Ferris, Co-Director
National Organisation of Circumcision Information Resource Centre, South Africa
Dear Mr Ferris
CIRCUMCISION OF BABIES FOR PROPOSED HIV PREVENTION
We refer to the above matter and your email correspondence of 16 February 2011. The matter was discussed by the members of the Human Rights, Law & Ethics Committee at their previous meeting and they agreed with the content of the letter by NOCIRC SA. The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission. We trust that you will find this in order.
Yours faithfully

“Human rights violation”: Blood, Sweat and Tears singer Jason Paige condemns circumcision
Hot on the heels of Russell Crowe calling circumcision “stupid and barbaric”, another celebrity has spoken out against the practice. This time it’s Jason Paige, lead singer for the rock group Blood, Sweat and Tears, who has devised a one-man show to highlight the physical damage that circumcision can cause and to show people that doing it to babies, children or anybody who has not given informed consent is a serious human rights violation. He told his story in an interview with Rebecca Wald, founder of the blog Beyond the Bris.
“Los Angeles performer Jason Paige wants the audience of his one-man comedy show to realize his song about his botched bris isn’t a joke. So he calls a few audience members to the stage and has them face him. The rest of the audience can’t see Jason as he pulls down his pants to reveal what he calls his “piercing,” a small hole in his penis through which he can--and does, for performances--dangle an earring. Proof to the crowd of his circumcision gone wrong comes as the audience participants return to their seats, stunned looks on their faces.
“Jason has a circumcision complication known as a skin bridge. A remanent of his foreskin became fused to the head of his penis as an infant during the healing process. Sometimes skin bridges can result in painful erections and severe disfigurement. In Jason’s case, it prompted him to learn more about ""what goes down"" during a circumcision procedure, and ultimately to oppose the practice. It also inspired him to record a music video titled “Circumcision” and sung to the tune of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstitious.” In the parody, Jason wears a black tee-shirt with white letters that ask: Guess Where I’m Pierced?”
[Note: Skin bridges are a very common complication of circumcision. The high risk of such an adverse result is yet another reason why circumcision, if it must be performed, should not be done until the foreskin has separated naturally from the glans and become fully retractable.]

Another U.S. state drops circumcision from its medical benefits schedule
Colorado has become the 18th American state to drop medically unnecessary circumcision from the schedule of medical benefits under the Medicaid program. The decision comes as a result of a campaign by human rights and child protection advocates to protect baby boys from genital cutting, and in response to the budgetary crisis affecting so many American public authorities. When there is little enough funds available for necessary medical procedures, it makes no sense to waste valuable health dollars on unnecessary and harmful operations that the recipients do not want.

More circumcision deaths in South Africa
So far this month (June 2011) seven boys have died from circumcision wounds in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province. Winter is the traditional time for teenage boys from the Xhosa people to be circumcised in accordance with a customary tribal rite by which they are initiated into adult status. The operation has always had a high casualty rate, so much so that in 2003 the South African Medical Journal called for action to “stop the carnage”. Last year 62 boys died from the operation and a further 23 lost all of their genitals, so it does not appear that this appeal has had much impact.
According to the South African newspaper New Age, the deaths occurred “despite large-scale intervention from the departments of health and local government and traditional affairs as well as traditional leaders to stop the deaths of initiates.” Nkosi Xolile Ndevu, provincial secretary of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa said the deaths initiates was attributed to profit-driven traditional surgeons who did not perform the ritual properly. “Some of them have no knowledge on how to carry out the custom, leaving these young boys in the hands of inexperienced young men,” said Ndevu. Health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo agreed and shared Ndevu’s sentiments. “These killings are attributed to assault and poor coordination of the custom in some parts of the province,” said Kupelo. Supporters of the circumcision rite say that because it is a traditional custom it should not be interfered with and must be allowed to continue.
We are struck by the difference between the deafening silence of Western medical and human rights agencies when it comes to the death of boys from traditional circumcision and the loud noise of their zealous efforts to eradicate far milder and less harmful forms of female genital cutting. Apparently, harm to boys does not matter. One fact is clear: in South Africa, more teenage boys die from circumcision than from heterosexually-transmitted HIV-AIDS.

New study: Circumcision cuts sexual satisfaction in men and partners
A study by Danish researchers has found that circumcision not only reduces sexual satisfaction in circumcised men, but also in their female partners. The study, reported at 20th World Congress for Sexual Health, Glasgow, in June 2011, and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, examined the association of male circumcision with a range of sexual measures in both sexes. The conclusion was that male circumcision was “associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.”
The authors comment that more study of these issue is warranted, especially in regions where circumcision is more common than in Denmark (where it is, of course, extremely rare). The authors do not specify these places, but they are most likely referring to the United States, where circumcision is still extremely common, and to the African countries, where circumcision is being introduced on a mass scale as a tactic against heterosexually-transmitted HIV infection. An implication of their study is that if African men are not being informed as to the possible adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function and satisfaction, their consent to the operation may not be legally valid.

Guardian: Time to ban all genital cutting of minors?
Boys, as well as girls, are entitled to legal protection against genital cutting, according to a recent article in the British Guardian newspaper. The authors, Neil Howard and Rebecca Steinfeld, make a forceful case that it is discriminatory and unfair for girls to be protected from genital mutilation while millions of boys continue to be subjected to circumcision, usually without any kind of regulation or supervision.
Commenting on the Californian proposal to make it illegal to perform any medically-unnecessary cutting of the genitals of male minors (under 18 years), the authors point out that the medical arguments in favour of circumcision (claims of reduced susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections) do not apply to children, and that the religious/cultural arguments are debatable. “Certainly, the ability to freely practise one's religion remains a vital component of any liberal democracy”, they write. “But should this trump an individual's right to their bodily integrity? And shouldn't such a principle be extended to all those who, by virtue of their age, are too young to decide on which body parts they would or would not like to keep?” Fundamentally, the issue comes down to whether males and females have equal rights, or whether, when it comes to bodily integrity, males are second class citizens.

""Barbaric and stupid"": Actor Russell Crowe condemns circumcision
New Zealand born movie star Russell Crowe recently added weight to the U.S. campaign against involuntary circumcision of infant boys by calling it “stupid and barbaric”. Expressing his thoughts through his Twitter account on 2 June, he added “Who are you to correct nature? Babies are perfect?”
As with all comments on Twitter, especially from famous people, his comments ignited a firestorm of responses, some critical, many in agreement, and of course the usual red herring that to criticise circumcision was somehow an expression of anti-semitism. Crowe defended himself by pointing out that he was not in the least anti-Semitic and had many Jewish friends, and that he was taking a stand for the “perfection of babies”.
Despite claims that Crowe apologised for his remarks (e.g. in the New York Times report, which mistakenly referred to him as Australian-born and began with ill-mannered speculations about his own children), it is clear that Crowe stands by his comments. His only apology was to regret that his remarks had caused offence in some quarters. ""I have a deep and abiding love for all people of all nationalities. I'm very sorry that I have said things on here that have caused distress."" He did not intend to mock the rituals of other religions etc, but added: ""I can't apologize for my heartfelt belief.”
We see no reason for Crowe to apologise to anybody. The old canard that to criticise circumcision is to attack the Jews (and presumably any other culture that practises circumcision, though these are rarely mentioned) is nothing more than an attempt to suppress discussion of the subject - in other words, blatant censorship and denial of free speech. If to criticise circumcision is to be anti-semitic it is obviously impossible to criticise circumcision at all - which result is, of course, is the purpose of the allegation. In fact, Jewish people have always been prominent in the American anti-circumcision movement, and an increasing number of Jewish voices are supporting the campaign in California to give male minors the same level of legal protection against genital cutting that girls already enjoy.
There is no reason to suppose when he made his remark that Crowe was thinking of Jews at all. Living in the USA he must be aware that the majority of American parents circumcise their sons; Jews are only a tiny fraction of this number. In all likelihood he was thinking of circumcision as a stupid American practice. Nobody has jumped up and down and complained that his remarks were anti-American.
For all that, Crowe is right: circumcision first emerged as an initiatory blood rite among barbaric tribes, and it is stupid for civilised people to maintain such a cruel practice in this modern age.
Uganda: Circumcision campaign increases HIV infections
Recent news reports from Africa reveal that circumcision as a tactic for stopping the spread of HIV is having the opposite effect, as men who have consented to be circumcised believe that they are now completely immune to infection and can have as much unsafe sex as they like, with as many partners as they can find, and don’t need to use condoms. In Uganda a report has found that “new HIV/AIDS messages meant to reduce the prevalence of the disease are instead facilitating its spread”, while in Swaziland a poster campaign is generally interpreted by men as meaning “that after circumcision, they would be safe from sexually transmitted illnesses”. This is exactly the result that critics of the circumcision solution have consistently predicted and warned against from the start. Suggesting that circumcision is a “surgical vaccine” against HIV, as many irresponsible researchers, circumcision promoters and journalists have done, gives people a false sense of security and encourages them to engage in unsafe sex - with inevitably tragic results.

Circumcision: Let the owner of the foreskin decide
An article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that it is wrong to circumcise male infants, but that the operation could reasonably “be offered” to boys just before puberty. This is the opinion of Dr Noni Macdonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhouisie University, who writes that since the “potential benefits” of circumcision kick in only after males become sexually active, it would make more sense to offer circumcision to 11-year olds than to do it to babies. “The [infant] isn’t at risk of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, because they’re not sexually active, so why are we rushing to do it at that time?” She wonders why people are more likely to accept circumcision of a baby, who cannot give any kind of consent, and for whom the operation is of no benefit at all, than of a pre-teen, who might have at least some chance of understanding his options.
Good questions, but we do not feel that Professor Macdonald has come up with the right answers. She is correct to say that it is unethical to circumcise anybody without informed consent, and also that infants cannot possibly derive any benefit from such an operation, but we cannot agree that it would be acceptable to routinely “offer” to circumcise boys at 11 or 12 years of age. If boys at that age are not considered capable of consenting to sexual relations with other people, they are certainly not competent to consent to having part of their genitals surgically removed – an irreversible step, far more radical than mere sexual activity.
Another objection is that the average 11 year old does not have sufficient maturity, independence or knowledge to agree to such an operation, and is too subject to pressure from parents, relatives and peers to be able to make a free and informed choice. If circumcision provides some degree of protection against sexually transmitted infections (a contentious point), the only logical age at which a male can legally consent to circumcision would be the same as the age of consent for sexual purposes – that is, from 16 to 21 years, depending on the jurisdiction. In other words, if it is wrong to perform circumcision in infancy, it is equally wrong to perform it at any time before legal adulthood.

Circumcision may increase HIV risk
An article in the Journal of Public Health in Africa warns that mass circumcision programs in Africa will not only fail to lower the incidence of HIV, but may actually increase the risk of HIV infection. The authors point out that the only evidence for circumcision having any protective effect (and even then only for men during unprotected intercourse with an infected female partner) is found in three clinical trials, but that the trials are riddled with methodological flaws. Among other problems, there was no way of telling whether the men who became HIV positive did so through sexual contact or through non-sexual means (such as non-sterile medical treatment); and the protective effect of circumcision has been exaggerated (a risk reduction of somewhere between 38 and 64 per cent, not the “60 per cent” trumpeted by the media). On top of this there is no evidence that even this level of protection will be replicated in the real world, outside the artificial conditions of the trials, in which the men received an intensive level of counselling not likely to be repeated elsewhere.
As well these flaws the authors point out that we still lack a plausible biological explanation of how the foreskin increases the risk of HIV infection (if it does); that men who have been circumcised are more likely to engage in unsafe sex (and that many men actually submit to circumcision because they think it means that they do not need to use a condom); and that the massive sums being poured into once-off circumcision programs (literally billions of dollars) consumes resources that could be used for more effective and less harmful tactics.
Abstract: The World Health Organization and UNAIDS have supported circumcision as a preventive for HIV infections in regions with high rates of heterosexually transmitted HIV; however, the circumcision solution has several fundamental flaws that undermine its potential for success. This article explores, in detail, the data on which this recommendation is based, the difficulty in translating results from high risk adults in a research setting to the general public, the impact of risk compensation, and how circumcision compares to existing alternatives. Based on our analysis it is concluded that the circumcision solution is a wasteful distraction that takes resources away from more effective, less expensive, less invasive alternatives. By diverting attention away from more effective interventions, circumcision programs will likely increase the number of HIV infections.

New South Wales doctor found guilty of genital mutilation
A former New South Wales doctor who excised a woman’s external genitals during an operation to remove a small patch of discoloured tissue on her labia has been found guilty of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. His victim, aged 58 at the time of the operation, told the court that the doctor had informed her that he was going to remove a lesion, but never mentioned removing anything else. If he had, she said “I would never have walked through that hospital door to start with”. The doctor’s defence, that the complete removal of the woman’s external genitalia was necessary to stop a cancerous growth from spreading, was rejected as spurious. The doctor’s name has been suppressed by the court, though will presumably be revealed when he comes up for sentencing at a later date.

Circumcision insignificant protection against cancer virus
An American study of of 4000 men in Brazil, Mexico and Florida (USA) has found that around half the population carries strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV) implicated in the generation of cervical and prostate cancer, but that the main risk factor for developing cancer is having a large number of sexual partners. Circumcision was found to have little protective effect against infection with the virus. Instead, the researchers recommend that vaccination with one of the new HPV vaccines that are already being given to women also be made available to men.

Anaesthetic risk to infants
A semi-editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine has called for more research into the effects of anaesthetics on infants and young children. The authors are concerned at emerging evidence that exposure to anaesthetics can have unpredictable effects on behaviour and learning ability and may cause brain damage. They write:
""A retrospective cohort analysis followed a birth cohort of 383 children who underwent inguinal hernia repair during the first 3 years of life and compared them with 5050 children in a control sample who had undergone no hernia repair before the age of 3.4 The children who underwent hernia repair were twice as likely as those who did not to be given a diagnosis of a developmental or behavioral disorder . A population-based, retrospective, birth-cohort study examined the educational and medical records of children who were exposed to a single anesthetic, two anesthetics, or more. In contrast to the hernia-repair study, this study reported no increased risk of learning disabilities with a single anesthetic . However, an increasing risk of learning disabilities was associated with two or more anesthetics . The risk of learning disabilities also increased with greater cumulative exposure to anaesthesia.""
Although the authors point out that no firm conclusions can be drawn from these studies, there is cause for concern and justification for further research. If it is found that anaesthesia does harm the infant brain it will pose a severe dilemma for circumcision promoters. It is now agreed that circumcision without anaesthesia is totally unacceptable, and indeed circumcision has been described by the Professor of Surgery at Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne as “close to the legal definition of assault if no consent was given and no anaesthetic or analgesia was used”. [1] But if it is not possible to give an effective anaesthetic or to get informed consent from an infant or child, it would appear that it is also impossible to circumcise him, and the operation must be delayed until he is old enough to tolerate the one and understand the other.

United States losing faith in circumcision
Although the United States remains the last bastion of routine circumcision as a “health precaution”, the incidence of circumcision in there has been declining slowly since the 1970s, and more rapidly since the turn of the century: one recent estimate claims that it has fallen as low as 33 per cent, though this figure is not accepted by everybody. A feature of the US situation is the growing gulf between the official opinion of bodies such as the Centers for Disease Control and the circumcision policy committees of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which are stacked with believers in circumcision and wish to see the practice continue, and a growing community groundswell against the practice, led by women, and especially mothers. One expression of this movement is a proposal in California for a new law to treat medically unnecessary circumcision of a male minor on the same basis as female genital cutting, that is, as a criminal offence. Whether or not the law is passed, it is stimulating debate on the issue, and for the first time in many years the circumcision advocates find themselves in a defensive position, and rather on the back foot, as an increasing number of critical articles in mainstream newspapers and magazines suggest.

“Bizarre mutilation”: Child health journal dismisses circumcision
An editorial in the January edition of the (Australian) Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health calls circumcision a “bizarre mutilation” and dismisses claims that it contributes to hygiene or improves child health. The editorial, by the editor in chief, David Isaacs, covers several aspects of both ritual and “health” circumcision, runs through the origins of circumcision as a religious/cultural rite in the region bordering the Red Sea, and comments that “there seem to be insufficient health benefits for circumcision to have evolved through natural selection”. He also devotes some attention to the rise of medically-rationalised circumcision of infants in nineteenth century Britain and the USA, and although the discussion is brief, he correctly notes that at that time the principle selling point for the operation was that it would discourage masturbation in infants and boys. Professor Isaacs concludes with a question that deserves greater debate – “Should the autonomy of an infant to choose when he is older outweigh his parents’ right to choose to have their infant son circumcised?” – but does not explore this issue. His remark that circumcision is no laughing matter seems undermined by the rather flippant style in which the editorial is written. Overall its message is that circumcision is primarily a cultural ritual and from a medical point of view too trivial a matter to be discussed in medical journals.

Circumcision in boys and girls: British Medical Journal criticises the double standard
An article in the ""Viewpoint"" section of the British Medical Journal by Dr Mihail Evans mounts a reasoned and powerful critique of the prevailing double standard on male and female genital cutting, encoded as it is in the terms commonly used: male circumcision but female genital mutilation. Dr Evans writes: ""New legislation in France has led to more debate on whether wearing the veil amounts to the sexual repression of Muslim women. Islam’s treatment of women is a regular topic in the Western press, yet few jump to the defence of Muslim and other little boys subjected to childhood circumcision. Indeed, the circumcision of the grandson of President Sarkozy, ironically a proponent of the veil ban, made only the gossip pages in France. As a permanent surgical genital alteration, circumcision is arguably a much more serious matter. After all, a Muslim woman has, at least in theory, the option to throw away her veil. The circumcised man’s foreskin has been thrown away already.""

Medical Journal of Australia: The case against circumcision as HIV preventive
In September last year the Medical Journal of Australia published an article in which David Cooper, Alex Wodak and Brian Morris called for a dramatic scaling up of neonatal circumcision in Australia as a response to an alleged rising incidence of heterosexually trasnsmitted HIV infection. The suggestion raised many eyebrows at the time, and was roundly rejected by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which had just finalised its own policy statement on circumcision, having found that there was no medical justification for the practice in Australia, and specifically denying that HIV-AIDS in adults was a valid reason to circumcise children. The MJA was slow to publish criticism of the Cooper, Wodak, Morris call, but at last, on 17 January, they published no fewer than eight letters rebutting their arguments. As an editorial note introducing the letters comments, ""An article in the 20 September issue of the Journal that suggested circumcision of infant boys could be considered a “surgical vaccine” against future heterosexually transmitted HIV has attracted strong criticism from many of our readers."" Covering a wide range of issues, from law, ethics and human rights to the principles of evidence-based medicine, the letters amount to a comprehensive rebuttal of the Cooper et al position.

World AIDS Day editorial endorses behavioural change as the great hope for AIDS control
Also in the Medical Journal of Australia, an editorial for World AIDS Day (1 December)
argues that behavioral change is still the tip of the spear for effective HIV prevention. Entitled, ""HIV will only be defeated when behavioural means of prevention become the basis of the global response,"" William D. Bowtell writes, ""We can contain HIV by improving access to treatments and providing care to people with the disease. But HIV will only be defeated and eradicated when the lessons of behavioural prevention that we developed and applied in Australia two decades ago become the basis of the global response."" There is no mention of the C word because circumcision has no place in effective prevention efforts.
Another reason not to circumcise:
Australia faces big MRSA problem
The 17 January edition of MJA Insight reports that Australia has a serious and increasing problem with a variety of Staphylococcus aureus that has become resistant to most antibiotics. MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Staph bacteria are commonly found on the skin and in the nasal cavity, and are the cause of many serious infections, ranging from boils and carbuncles to septicaemia (gangrene), osteomyelitis, pneumonia and abscesses in almost any part of the body. They commonly infect surgical wounds, particularly in clinical settings (such as surgeries) where many operations are performed and it is almost impossible to ensure a sterile environment. This is yet another reason why unnecessary surgeries such as non-therapeutic circumcision should be avoided.
A summary of the report is available at News in Depth.
Study finds no association between HPV risk and lack of circumcision
A large-scale study has found no association between circumcision status and susceptibility to infections with human papilloma virus (HPV), a group of wart viruses responsible for genital herpes and implicated in the generation of cervical and other genital cancers. The study involved 3463 heterosexual men from 71 sites in 18 countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Although there have been claims that circumcision may reduce the risk of infection with HPV, this study was unable to confirm such findings.
Abstract
Background. We examined the baseline prevalence of penile, scrotal, and perineal/perianal human papillomavirus (HPV) in heterosexual men (HM). We also evaluated baseline characteristics of HM to assess factors associated with prevalent HPV detection.
Methods. We tested serum samples from 3463 HM aged 16–24 years with 1–5 lifetime female sexual partners for antibodies to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. We collected baseline swab specimens for the detection of DNA of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59 from 3 areas: penile, scrotal, and perineal/perianal. Risk factors for prevalent HPV DNA detection were evaluated.
Results. The prevalence of any tested HPV type was 18.7% at the penis, 13.1% at the scrotum, 7.9% at the perineal/perianal region, and 21.0% at any site. Having >3 lifetime female sexual partners had the greatest impact on HPV prevalence: odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–4.9) for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18; and OR 4.5 (95% CI 3.3–6.1) for all HPV types tested. HPV DNA detection was highest in Africa. Neither condom usage nor circumcision was associated with HPV DNA prevalence.
Conclusion. Genital-HPV DNA detection is common in young, sexually active HM. We found HPV to be most prevalent in African men and least prevalent in men from the Asia-Pacific region. Increased numbers of sexual partners was an important risk factor for HPV DNA prevalence.

Routine circumcision of normal male infants and boys
Have the circumcision promoters made a convincing case?
What is most interesting about the argument of the circumcision promoters - that all boys should be circumcised soon after birth - is that most of the health benefits they proclaim do not kick in until adulthood or old age. If the ""advantages"" of circumcision were as overwhelming as the advocates assert, you would think that babies and boys could be left alone and that most rational adults would choose to have the operation done in their late teens or early twenties. Oddly enough, when they get to that age most men prefer to keep their foreskins. In fact, even if it were valid, the ""health"" case for routine or preventive circumcision never amounted to a convincing argument for circumcising infants or boys. At its best, it was no more than an argument for circumcision in adulthood. Even if all the claims were true, the most you would expect is that a few ultra-nervous adults would elect it for themselves, not that the operation would be inflicted on thousands of babies who had never even inquired.
On this page we review the arguments of the circumcision promoters, suggest some reasons for the revival of the old ""health"" arguments for circumcision since the mid-1990s, and ask why the advocates insist that children must be circumcised even before they are aware of their bodies.
The fate of the foreskin
Between the mid-eighteenth and the late nineteenth century, but only in English-speaking countries, the status of the male foreskin fell disastrously. It was transformed from ""the best of your property"", as a popular rhyme of the period put it, and an adornment which brought pleasure to its owner and his partners, to ""a useless bit of flesh"", an enemy of man, and a ""harbour for filth"", as Dr Remondino and other scissors-happy doctors of the late Victorian period asserted. It is hard to think of any body part whose standing fell so far and so rapidly, nor one which came to be treated with such savage hostility; even today in countries with a history of routine circumcision doctors seem to regard the foreskin as guilty until proven innocent. Yet, as the Canadian pathologists Chris Cold and John Taylor point out, the prepuce has been a prominent feature of the external genitals of all primate species for 65 million years, and the species in which it has developed most luxuriantly is precisely the one which has been most successful in the struggle for existence; despite this, since the nineteenth century it has been ""the most vilified normal anatomical structure of the human body"" (1).
But aside from calling the foreskin nasty names, have the supporters of involuntary circumcision really made much of a case for their favourite surgery? Strictly speaking, it is not the opponents of routine male circumcision who need to make a case against the procedure, but its supporters who must prove its necessity: they need to explain why a natural part of the human body, and one common to all primates, is so dangerous that it must be amputated before a baby can talk, crawl or do anything much except scream. What has naturally evolved must be presumed to be beneficial or harmless unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Here we will consider what sort of a case the anti-foreskin lobby has been able to put up.
What is the foreskin?
The penis consists of several major parts, but one useful way of looking at it is to divide it into an erectile portion (the part that gets stiff) and a non-erectile portion (the part that does not). The foreskin is the non-erectile portion. A more conventional definition would be to describe it as the soft, sensitive double-fold of tissue which covers the lower half of the penis shaft, extends in a sleeve over the head (glans) and usually ends in a tapering nozzle or spout. The outer layer is tender skin, the inner layer a sensitive mucous membrane. There is no agreed anatomical definition about where the foreskin ends and the skin of the penis shaft begins, and hence no exact surgical definition of what circumcision is meant to remove. As a consequence, the amount of tissue cut off by the operation is highly variable (some doctors take more, some less), but a typical circumcision carried out in a western hospital will remove about 50 per cent of the surface tissue of the penis.
The foreskin is not just a flap of skin, but a complex web of mucous membrane, muscle fibres, blood vessels and nerves: in fact, it supports one of the densest concentrations of nerves in the whole body. The underside of the penis (just beneath the glans) is called the fraenum, and this carries ridged bands which are densely packed with fine-touch nerve receptors and a very rich blood supply. The main nerve supplying the penis goes down to the end and then doubles back, allowing the foreskin to slide backwards and forwards, and showing that this is exactly what it evolved to be able to do. To operate at its best, the penis is meant to be covered with a mobile sheath of responsive flesh.

What is routine male circumcision?
Circumcision is the surgical amputation of this tissue. By routine male circumcision we mean the removal of the foreskin from the penis of normal male babies or boys, on the decision of adults (usually parents or guardians), without the boy's consent, and in the absence of any genuine medical indication, and particularly in the absence of the sort of critical injury, malformation or disease that would be required for the legal amputation of any other part of the body without the subject's consent. In the past the procedure was referred to as Routine Neonatal Circumcision or Routine Infant Circumcision, abbreviated here as RNC.
Strictly speaking, RNC is no longer practised in Australia, since most doctors are opposed to the practice and only do it in response to parental insistence. Each case today is thus an individual decision, not a matter of mere routine. In the heydey of circumcision in the 1950s, doctors pressured parents to agree to have their baby boys circumcised and would automatically do it unless they strenuously objected; sometimes they did it without even parental consent. The essential elements of routine (medically unnecessary) circumcision as practised today are (1) decision by adults; (2) absence of medical indication or need; (3) lack of consent on the part of the boy.
The cat which tried to come back
Circumcision was a Victorian medical fad which should have gone out with neck-to-knee bathing costumes, phrenology and the idea that children should be seen and not heard. Instead, a small band of medical researchers and moral fanatics keep coming up with new reasons for doing it. First there was the claim that it would stop masturbation and the imaginary disease of spermatorrhoea. Then it was suggested that it would protect men from syphilis. Then doctors forgot that all baby boys have a tight and non-retractable foreskin (phimosis) and declared that the natural condition of the infant penis was a pathological abnormality requiring urgent surgical correction. After that it was asserted that circumcision would give immunity to cancer of the penis in men and of the cervix in women. Some doctors seriously believed that circumcision would cure various forms of muscular paralysis, brass poisoning and whooping cough; others claimed it would prevent tuberculosis, polio, epilepsy and wet dreams. Then there was a lot of vague talk about hygiene, as though boys and men were too stupid to wash themselves, and ridiculous references to embarrassment in locker rooms.
At no time did more than a handful of adult men choose to have themselves circumcised; it was always something to done to babies and boys without their agreement or permission.
In the 1990s the myth about syphilis was revived in a new form: that uncircumcised men have a higher risk of catching HIV-AIDS (and that therefore all boys should be circumcised soon after birth). Most recently there has been an attempt to resuscitate the old claim (dating from the 1930s, refuted by studies in the 1960s and 70s) that male circumcision will reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in their female partners. One by one these claims for the harmfulness of the foreskin and the benefits of its amputation have been proven false or misguided, but new reasons keep being invented.
The British heritage
Australia inherited circumcision from Britain in the nineteenth century, and by the early 1900s as many as 25 per cent of male infants were already having part of their penis cut off, either soon after birth or in early childhood. Although Britain itself dropped RNC in the late 1940s (and New Zealand in the 1950s), Australia followed United States practice, and the figure rose steadily to a peak of about 90 per cent in 1955, before falling back again: down to 50 per cent by 1975, and only 10 per cent by 1995.

It can be seen from the table that the biggest jump in the rate of RNC occurred in the decade 1910-1920, giving Australia the distinction of being the first modern nation to circumcise half its male babies. This was a period of acute fear of venereal disease, particularly syphilis; the erroneous belief that circumcision would provide protection against syphilis was probably an important reason why more parents were having their boys cut at this time. The year 2000 was a landmark as the first time since 1945 when the total number of uncut males in Australia outnumbered the circumcised. Interestingly, though, despite the hight rate of RNC, the total number of cut males has never exceeded 61 per cent - less than two thirds.
The rate of routine circumcision declined steadily in the 1980s and 90s and looked set to fall below 5 per cent nationally, but there has been a slight rise in the frequency of the procedure since 1999, possibly as a response to recent scares over STDs (especially HIV-AIDS), urinary tract infections (UTIs) and most recently HPV (human papillomavirus -- the wart virus implicated in cancer of the penis and cervix). Long-time advocates of RNC have been doing their best to exploit popular fears of these diseases in order to put pressure on the medical profession to revive the procedure as a public health measure, despite powerful criticism of their claims in the medical literature and increasing warnings that the procedure is unethical and potentially illegal (as the Queensland Law Reform Commission warned in 1993).
Why is circumcision an issue all of a sudden?
Although Australia largely abandoned RNC in the 1980s, and did so with very little fuss, the issue has suddenly become topical and controversial. A few die-hard circumcision enthusiasts and medical researchers, mainly from the USA and other cultures where routine male circumcision is the rule, are making strident claims for the protective effect of circumcision against a number of diseases which defy normal control strategies, and particularly the one for which there is still no cure and of which everybody is afraid: AIDS. They attempt to exploit this fear by demanding widespread (indeed, universal) circumcision of male infants as a public health measure, on the feeble and misleading analogy that it is just like immunisation, and thus the sort of harmless and effective medical intervention which should be made compulsory. The main objective of this propaganda is to halt the decline of RNC in the USA and to revive it in Australia, Canada and Britain.
See pages on cervical cancer and HIV-AIDS.
Cultural conservatism drives revival of health arguments for circumcision
The evidence strongly suggests that the push for mass male circumcision as the answer to AIDS is driven more by culture than by science – or rather, by science in the service of culture. If the genital mucosa is the Trojan horse for HIV and its reduction by various forms of pre-emptive excision decreases a person’s risk of becoming infected, it follows that the genital mucosa of the female (on the clitoral hood and labia, for example) might be as vulnerable as the male foreskin, and thus that certain forms of female circumcision might protect women in the same way as posthectomy is thought to protect men. There is in fact evidence that female circumcision does reduce the risk of HIV infection in women (Stallings and Karugendo 2005), and at least one other study suggests that female circumcision can also indirectly protect women from HIV infection (Yount and Abraham 2007). But so strong is the revulsion from any form of female genital surgery among the Western researchers and agencies that control AIDS policy that it is not considered proper even to ask the question, let alone conduct research into the possibility. Like the obstetricians who shouted Baker Brown down, modern health policy makers prefer female genitals intact, no matter what health advantages might accrue from surgical intervention. If the male genitals were regarded with the same respect as the female, MGC would be held in the same abhorrence as FGC, and experiments involving foreskin removal would be unthinkable.
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
The sudden resurgence of demands for routine circumcision of boys as a health precaution in some developed countries (notably the United States and Australia) has a similarly cultural explanation. Paradoxically, it can be traced back to developments in the 1980s that sought to improve the legal mechanisms for child protection and reduce all forms of child abuse. These were expressed most dramatically in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), Article 24 (3) of which required parties to take “all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children. This looked promising, but a startling procedural fact that Svoboda (2004) unearthed shows that it did not take long for “children” to mean “girls only.” As late as 25 June 1997, one document pertaining to the UN’s work on traditional practices referred to the responsible official, known as a special rapporteur, as “Special Rapporteur on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children” (United Nations Commission on Human Rights 1997a). But by the time the pertinent meeting was nearing its conclusion and had issued its report on the session, the special rapporteur’s mandate had been changed to cover “traditional practices affecting the health of women and the girl child” (United Nations Commission on Human Rights 1997b). There had never been any substantive discussion of this highly significant change, which excluded all male children at the stroke of a pen, nor was the change of title ever alluded to in any known UN document.
Other pertinent child protection developments include the rise of a vocal intact rights (anti-circumcision) movement in the only Western country where routine MGC remained common (the United States); a hesitant but visible tendency for secular and reforming Jews to question the necessity for the rite; and, in places where MGC was unusual and abhorred (such as Scandinavia), measures to regulate ritual circumcision as performed by ethnic and religious minorities. Given that the wording of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child protected all children without discrimination, it is curious but symptomatic of assumptions about gender and sexuality that many governments passed legislation to make all forms of FGC unlawful, but none prohibited any form of MGC. Although some jurisdictions (such as the Australian States of South Australia and Queensland) looked seriously into the question of whether circumcision of boys should also be restricted, no current government has moved far in this direction. Sweden has placed mild restrictions on the practice, and the South Africa’s Children’s Act 2007 makes the circumcision of male children under age 16 unlawful except for religious or medical reasons – which are, of course, the two principal categories of justification for the practice. As Smith (1998) had found, however, the Convention on the Rights of the Child clearly referred to genital mutilation of children, without discrimination on the basis of gender, and there could be no valid or effective response, in terms of human rights or medical ethics, to the argument that circumcision of minor was a violation of accepted principles of human rights and medical ethics.
Would female circumcision protect against AIDS?
Since all the arguments deployed against FGC applied just as strongly to MGC (McDonald 2004, Bouclin 2005, Narulla 2007), the persistence of the practice was an anomaly that demanded attention. But the Convention left a loophole in its reference to “practices prejudicial to health”, that is, harmful practices: if MGC could be shown to be not harmful or, even better, beneficial in some way, then Article 24 would not apply to MGC, and those who wanted to continue the practice, whether for traditional or medical reasons, could continue doing so with a clear conscience and little fear of restriction. It was the imperative to save MGC from the human rights experts, lawyers and ethicists that has inspired the resurgence of research and advocacy, not only into the benefits of the procedure (old ones dusted up, new ones found), but a whole new research agenda, defying common sense and the consensus of the ages, aimed at proving that deleting the most densely innervated parts of the penis makes no difference to sexual experience (Morris 1999, 2006). This research flies in the face of reason, common sense and plenty of other research.
To defend a customary practice with the discoveries or rhetoric of science is not a new strategy. Back in Roman times the Jewish philosopher Philo sought to discourage his co-religionists from abandoning male circumcision (as some were doing, in the interests of integration) with several arguments, prominent among which was the claim that it conferred immunity against a kind of carbuncle on the penis that he called anthrax (Darby 2003:57). In mid-nineteenth century Germany, a strong movement among reforming Jews sought to drop male circumcision along with many other oppressive observances; their campaign was defeated by the conservative rabbis, who cited new medical evidence from Britain and the United States that male circumcision was an effective defence against syphilis, masturbation and other problems, and thus an example of modern science, not an ancient superstition at all (Efron 2001:189; Glick 2005: chs. 5 and 6).
Defending traditions with the rhetoric of science
But it was in the United States just before World War I that the strategy had its finest flowering. Confronted with evidence that ritual circumcision was infecting babies with serious diseases (including diphtheria, tuberculosis and syphilis), and with a consequent campaign by paediatricians to ban or at least regulate the procedure (Holt 1913), the physician Abraham Wolbarst had the genius to perceive that the surest way to preserve male circumcision as a religious rite within the Jewish community was to generalize it throughout the whole of society as a necessary health precaution. Accordingly, he did not try to justify it on the culturally relativist ground of ethnic particularity, but on the modern, scientific ground that it was a valid measure of preventive health that should be imposed on every male. Far from spreading syphilis, Wolbarst asserted (and produced statistics showing) that male circumcision conferred high resistance, if not immunity, to syphilis, as well as curing or preventing a great many other problems, including herpes, cancer, and masturbation. He understood that a modern society that respected science needed modern arguments in defence of ancient customs (Wolbarst 1914; Darby 2003).
Burden of proof
Strictly speaking, it is not the opponents of routine male circumcision who need to make a case against the procedure, but its supporters who must prove its necessity: they need to explain why a natural part of the human body, and one common to all primates, is so dangerous that it must be amputated before a baby can talk, crawl or do anything much except scream. But since the operation has become entrenched in the medical culture of English-speaking countries over the past 120 years, it has come to be seen as reasonable, customary or even normal. As the sorcerer's apprentice found to his cost, starting a practice (""seemed a good idea at the time …"") is often much easier than stopping it.
Advocates of RNC particularly have to
demonstrate (1) that the benefits of the operation significantly outweigh the injury inflicted, the risks of the procedure and the physical and psychological disadvantages of losing the foreskin; and (2) that the operation must be done before the child is able to give legal consent;
prove that the boy has a very high risk of incurring a fatal or incurable disease before maturity if he is not circumcised;
prove that circumcision will infallibly protect him from any such diseases;
prove that there is no other way of reducing the risk of such diseases by the same degree;
explain how a part of the body which has evolved over millions of years could be pathogenic (disease-producing) and must be removed to ensure a normal level of health.
No such proof has even been attempted, let alone achieved.
Human evolution
Advocates of RNC have never been able to explain why all primates (monkeys, chimps etc) have foreskins, or how humans became the most successful mammal on the planet while carrying this supposedly pathogenic burden. For 99 per cent of the million or so years during which modern humans have prospered, males have lived and died with their foreskins intact, and in that time our species managed to colonise just about every corner of the earth. Perhaps the foreskin was a factor in that triumph. There is good evidence that the human foreskin became longer, more luxuriant and more richly networked with sensory nerves than those of our near relatives, suggesting that it must have conferred a selective advantage: the more foreskin you had, the more offspring you left behind, and the more your extra-foreskin genes spread through the population. (Ref. 1) This could not have happened if the foreskin had been as troublesome as its enemies claim: what has naturally evolved must be presumed to be beneficial or harmless unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. (Ref. 2)
Trying to come up with the goods
It is this proof that circumcision advocates are obliged to provide, and which they have been struggling unsuccessfully to manufacture since the 1850s (when Jonathan Hutchinson announced that his statistics showed that circumcised men were all but immune to syphilis). The world is still waiting for them to make a convincing case. Although there have been mountains of reports and studies (more than anybody could read in a lifetime), the issue is still, at the most, inconclusive - so inconclusive, in fact, that the most rational and only ethical policy is to leave the choice up to the individual.
This has not prevented scaremongering professors and self-interested GPs (who make a lot of money from performing circumcision operations) from flooding the media and Google advertising with claims for the ""pros"" of circumcision. (Dr Russell's website also claims to discuss the cons, but you will look in vain for a list of those.) But the worst that even these crusaders can come up is a murky statement that that RNC ""may reduce the risk of STDs (syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes and candida) and carcinoma of the cervix in female partners"", as well as phimosis, paraphimosis, HIV-AIDS, neonatal UTIs and carcinoma of the penis. (Ref. 3) This is not good enough: ""may"" is not much different from ""may not"".
Australia's other prominent circumcision promoter, Professor Brian Morris, cites several studies which purport to show a higher incidence of gonorrhoea and syphilis among uncut males and reaches the dithering conclusions that (1) ""based on the bulk of evidence it would seem that at least some STDs could be more common in uncircumcised males under some circumstances""; but that (2) ""there may be little difference in most STDs between those with and those without a foreskin"". (Ref. 4) That's really helpful.
Can these guys be serious? They want to circumcise all boys at birth because retention of the foreskin ""may"" increase the risk of their getting a few diseases they most likely would not get anyway; most of which are curable; and which, even if they did get them, do not strike until many years later. Except for infantile UTIs (which are usually cured easily by antibiotics), there is plenty of time for a boy to reach maturity and make his own assessment of the risks and choose the best means, for him, of managing them. To make a convincing case for RNC Russell, Morris and Co must do much better than they have done so far: we need proof that that if the foreskin is not cut off urgently the child will get seriously ill or die before he is old enough to make his own health decisions. Nothing like this has ever been achieved by the circumcision lobby, or even seriously attempted. Statistics are not available, but it is quite likely that more boys under the age of eighteen die as a result of circumcision, or its complications, than from any of the diseases circumcision is supposed to protect them against. Certainly this is true in South Africa, where several hundred boys each year die as a result of tribal circumcision.
As to why boys must be circumcised in infancy, Morris is quite explicit: if the decision was left to them to make when they reached the age of consent they would make the wrong decision. (Ref. 5)
Further information on complications and on deaths and recent news items
Continuities with Victorian quackery
Both Dr Russell and Professor Morris are frequently seen in the media urging parents to have their boys circumcised, and much of their routine is just a long list of nasty diseases, designed to terrify people into seeking urgent medical aid. How different it is from the rantings of a Victorian quack is a matter of personal judgement. In 1891 Dr Peter Charles Remondino wrote:
The prepuce seems to exercise a malign influence in the most distant and apparently unconnected manner; where, like some of the evil genii or sprites in the Arabian tales, it can reach from afar the object of its malignity, striking him down unawares in the most unaccountable manner; making him a victim to all manner of ills, sufferings and tribulations; unfitting him for marriage or the cares of business; making him miserable and an object of continual scolding and punishment in childhood, through its worriments and nocturnal enuresis; later on, beginning to affect him with all kinds of physical distortions and ailments, nocturnal pollutions, and other conditions calculated to weaken him physically, mentally, and morally; to land him, perchance, in jail or even in a lunatic asylum."" (Ref. 6)
Presumably Professor Morris, who has repeatedly stated that the Victorians were ""right"" about circumcsion, also agrees with the following statement from Dr Remondino:
""Circumcision is like a substantial and well-secured life annuity; every year of life you draw the benefit, and it has not any drawbacks … Parents cannot make a better paying investment for their little boys, as it insures them better health, greater capacity for labor, longer life less nervousness, sickness, loss of time, and less doctor-bills, as well as increases their chances for an euthanasian death."" (Ref. 7)
Drs Russell and Morris are radicals and extremists: most Australian doctors are opposed to RNC or undecided on the issue, and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians has recently issued yet another statement against the practice. The truth is that RNC has never been supported by more than a small fraction of the world's medical establishment and remains a controversial and unproven therapy. Back in the 1890s an early opponent of RNC noted this confusion and uncertainty, not only over the risks and touted benefits of the operation but when and how to do it, how much tissue to excise, how to stop bleeding etc, and asked: ""Where doctors differ, who shall decide?"" (Ref. 8)
There can be only one answer to that question: the owner of the organ in question.

5. Morris, In favour of circumcision, p. 61-2. Morris writes: ""It would take a very mature and well-informed adolescent male to make this decision for himself, and to undertake the process of ensuring that it was done. Most males in the late teens and early twenties, not to mention many men of any age, are reluctant to confront such issues, even if they hold private convictions and preferences about their penis. Moreover, despite having problems with this part of their anatomy, many will suffer in silence rather than seek medical advice or treatment."" Or in plain English, men prefer to hang on to their foreskins because they like them.
Incidentally, contrary to Morris's assertion, there is not a shred of scientific evidence that circumcision must be done in infancy for maximum benefits against later disease. If that were true there would have been no point circumcising those adult men in the African circumcision-HIV experiments. It is equally untrue that circumcision is less risky and less harmful the earlier it is done; on the contrary, there is plenty of evidence that the earlier it is done the more risky and harmful it is. All responsible medical authorities recommend that it not be done at less than 6 months of age, and researchers in Saudi Arabia (where circumcision is common as an Islamic custom) have actually found circumcision to be significantly more dangerous if done soon after birth.

Male Circumcision May Not Protect Against HIV
Infection
By Danny Kucharsky
TORONTO, CANADA -- August 17, 2006 -- HIV prevalence
is not necessarily lower in populations that have
higher male circumcision rates, according to findings
from a study of African countries presented here at the
16th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2006).
The study, which examined the association between male
circumcision and HIV infection in 8 Sub-Saharan African
countries, contradicts the findings of previous
research and the opinion of several prominent
personalities active in the fight against AIDS, such as
former US President Bill Clinton.
While several studies have indicated that male
circumcision has a protective effect against sexually
transmitted infections (STI), including HIV infection,
the evidence is inconclusive, said investigator Dr.
Vinod Mishra, director of research, ORC
Macro, Calverton, Maryland. ""We're just questioning
that push,"" he said of the optimism displayed by
Clinton and others.
The study used demographic findings from recent
demographic and health surveys in Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho and Malawi, and AIDS
indicator surveys from Tanzania and Uganda. The surveys
were conducted from 2003 to 2005 and sample sizes
ranged from 3,300 men in Lesotho to 10,000 men in
Uganda.
In survey fieldwork in each country, men aged 15 to 59
gave blood for anonymous HIV testing. Information on
circumcision status and on STI/STI symptoms was based
on men's responses to questions in survey
interviews.
Prevalence of male circumcision ranged from a high of
96% in Ghana to a low of 21% in Malawi. Among the other
countries, circumcision rates were 84% in Kenya, 89% in
Burkina Faso and 25% in Uganda.
HIV prevalence was markedly lower among circumcised
than uncircumcised men only in Kenya (11.5% among
uncircumcised men vs. 3.1% among circumcised men). A
small protective effect of male circumcision was also
seen in Burkina Faso (2.9% vs. 1.7%, respectively) and
Uganda (5.5% vs. 3.7%).
In the other countries, there was either no difference
in HIV rates between circumcised and uncircumcised men
or circumcised men were more likely to be HIV-positive
than uncircumcised men. For example, in Lesotho, HIV
was seen in 23.4% of circumcised men compared to 15.4%
of uncircumcised men.
""If anything, the correlation [between circumcision
and HIV infection] goes the other way,"" in most of the
countries studied, Dr. Mishra said during his
presentation on August 15th.
When adjusted for socio-demographic and behavioral
factors, a small protective effect was observed in 6 of
the 8 countries, but it was not statistically
significant in any country, Dr. Mishra said.
In Kenya, and to a lesser extent, in Ghana, Malawi,
Tanzania and Uganda, circumcised men were less likely
than uncircumcised men to report having had an STI or
STI symptoms in the 12-month period prior to the survey
(2.1% vs. 5.4%, respectively). The relationship was
reversed in Cameroon (8.0% vs. 2.5%) and Lesotho (12.1%
vs. 7.5%).
With other factors controlled, male circumcision had
some protective effect in 5 of the 8 countries, but the
effect was statistically significant only in
Tanzania.
In addition, ""circumcised men tend to have more
lifetime sex partners, so there's some [high-risk]
behaviors that go with circumcision status,"" he
said.
A study limitation is that it was based on
self-reported information on circumcision status and
STI/STI symptoms. It also lacks data on age at
circumcision and degree of circumcision, which might
influence susceptibility to HIV infection.
However, Dr. Mishra said the study is consistent with
other research that has failed to find a protective
effect of male circumcision on HIV and STIs.

BACKGROUNDMale circumcision significantly reduced the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among men in three clinical trials, but what about other STD's?. This study assessed the efficacy of male circumcision for the prevention of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and syphilis in HIV-negative adolescent boys and men.
METHODSThis Prospective work enrolled 5534 HIV-negative, uncircumcised male subjects between the ages of 15 and 49 years in two trials of male circumcision for the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Of these subjects, 3393 (61.3%) were HSV-2-seronegative at enrollment. Of the seronegative subjects, 1684 had been randomly assignedto undergo immediate circumcision (intervention group) and 1709 to undergo circumcisionafter 24 months (control group). At baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months, the subjects weretested for HSV-2 and HIV infection and syphilis, along with performing physical examinationsand conducting interviews. In addition, a subgroup of subjects was evaluated for HPVinfection at baseline and at 24 months.
RESULTSAt 24 months, the cumulative probability of HSV-2 seroconversion was 7.8% in the intervention group and 10.3% in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio in the intervention group, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.92; P=0.008). The prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes was 18.0% in the intervention group and 27.9% in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; P=0.009). However, no significant difference between the two study groups was observed in the incidence of syphilis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.65; P=0.44).
CONCLUSIONSIn addition to decreasing the incidence of HIV infection, male circumcision significantly reduced the incidence of HSV-2 infection and the prevalence of HPV infection, findings that underscore the potential public health benefits of the circumcision procedure.back

Results from three random control trials (RCTs) done in Africa, which show a reduction in female-to-male transmission of HIV after circumcision, cannot be extrapolated to the real-world settling. Much evidence published recently calls into question the results of these trials, and raises serious doubts about the value of male circumcision in HIV prevention. No field test has been performed to test the theory and analyze the effectiveness, cost, and complications. To roll out a new program based on scant evidence, implying to the African public that circumcision will reduce a male’s chances of contracting HIV by 50–60 percent, is not only inconclusive [Mills], but misleading [Garenne]. Coercing adults, and forcing infants to be circumcised is unethical. Increased condom promotion and safe sex campaigns will accomplish much higher infection-frequency reduction.
Other Medical Organizations Concur
The Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations (AFAO) agrees. The AFAO issued a briefing paper: “Male Circumcision Has No Role in the Australian HIV Epidemic” (July, 2007). The key points were: no demonstrated benefit of circumcision in men who have sex with men; consistent condom use, not circumcision, is the most effective means of reducing female-to male transmission, and vice-versa; and African data on circumcision is context-specific and cannot be extrapolated to the Australian epidemic in any way. The paper compared Australia to America by concluding: “The USA has a growing heterosexual epidemic and very high rates of circumcision. Circumcision does not prevent HIV—in high prevalence areas it reduced the risk of female-to-male transmission. HIV acquisition rates were nevertheless high in both the circumcised and the non-circumcised groups involved in the trials.
The French Consiel National du SIDA issued a report to clarify the issues following the mass media reporting, and misreporting, of the three African RCTs. “The studies are generating debate among the scientific community and are also raising a number of questions with regard to its implementation and role in terms of public health strategy. Implementation of male circumcision as part of a raft of preventative measures could destabilise health care delivery and at the same time confuse existing prevention messages. The addition of a new ‘tool’ could actually cause a result opposite to that which was originally intended” [Rozenbaum].
The Royal Australasian College of Physicians’ policy statement on circumcision could not recommend circumcision to help stop the epidemic: “How much circumcision could contribute to ameliorate the current epidemic of HIV is uncertain” [Beasley].
Questions concerning study results
A number of confounding factors present in the study make it very difficult to generalize the results to the larger world population. All three studies were terminated after only 21-24 months, over 700 participants were lost to follow up, there HIV status unknown (4.5 times more participants were lost to follow up than were reported to have been protected from HIV by circumcision), study participants were provided free condoms and extensive education and counseling, a number of reported HIV infections were contracted from non-sexual means, and the participants were paid to be circumcised. These atypical conditions will not be present in any mass circumcision campaign.
Circumcision Difficult to Justify
A 2008 analysis of circumcision status and HIV rates concluded that circumcision is NOT associated with reduced HIV infection rates, contrary to claims of circumcision advocates [Garenne].
A meta-analysis of circumcision-related science and the HIV epidemic [Van Howe] showed that the outcome of mass circumcision would not be effective in stopping the spread of the disease, and went on to question researcher’s and promoter’s agendas. The Cochrane Collaboration Report of 2003, only objective systematic review of the use of male circumcision as an HIV prevention conducted to date, cautioned about potential researcher bias stating, “Circumcision practices are largely culturally determined, so there are strong beliefs and opinions surrounding them. It is important to acknowledge that researchers’ personal biases and dominant circumcision practices of their respective countries may influence interpretation of findings.”[Siegfried].
Circumcision Could Increase Risk of HIV
The long-term consequences of promoting circumcision might make the problem worse—by implying that circumcision protects males; it might give them and their partners a false sense of security and undermine safe sex practices and condom usage [Kalichman; Myers; Muula]. Even if the 50-60 percent protective effect the RCTs claim is true, and if all African males were circumcised over the next fifteen years, it would only reduce the number of infection cases there by 8 percent, and related deaths by 1 percent [Williams].
Men having sex with men are not protected from HIV, even if they are circumcised [Templeton]. The role of commercial sex workers and sexual networks has not be adequately addressed in plans to stop the epidemic [Talbott].
A Social Vaccine
Education, safe sex practices, and consistent condom use are proven, effective measures of curbing HIV transmission. Uganda demonstrated a 47 percent reduction in HIV prevalence from increased safe sex education and condom promotion—this “social vaccine” is available now, is highly effective, and does not involve the numerous risks and downsides of surgery [Low-Beer]. Consistent condom use reduces lifetime risk by 20 percent [Hallett], as compared to circumcision’s 8 percent [Williams].
Unethical Medical Practice
Extreme care needs to be taken to ensure that parents aren’t misled into thinking that the results of studies performed on adult African males should be extrapolated to health policy for newborns. It is unprecedented and perhaps unethical for a prophylactic surgery to be offered as a “health benefit” to parents of newborns to reduce risks of an adult acquired disease for which there are safer, less invasive, less expensive, and proven prevention methods available [Somerville; Fox].
Newborns are not sexually active and, therefore, not at risk for sexually contracted diseases. Furthermore, by the time today’s newborns are sexually active, a vaccine or other methods of treating the disease will probably will be available. Today’s newborns might prefer to retain their foreskin and opt, as adults, for vaccination and practicing safe sex practices, including using condoms.
New Data
Circumcision complication rate of 20.2% was found in Nigeria [Okeke]. HIV infections are greater following the circumcision of virgins, both male and female, indicating unsterile conditions [Brewer; Stallings]. Two US studies, released in 2007, found that circumcision made no difference in HIV transmission rates among US males. [Mor; Millett]. Previous mathematical modeling of heterosexual transmission of the virus is based on inflated transmission rates and implausible assumptions [Deuchert].
Recent evidence demonstrates that Langerhans cells in the foreskin have a protective effect against pathogens—including HIV—by secreting Langerin [de Witte]. The previous theory was that Langerhans cells are an entrance point for viruses. It now seems that the theory is partially true, but that the true mechanism at work is that Langerhans cells set a trap for viruses in order to destroy them with Langerin.
Circumcision constitutes the removal of healthy, functional, and biologically unique tissue and is unwarranted for the prevention of HIV [Cold].
Summary
The risks and harms of circumcision include:
a. Increased risks of MRSA and other infections in newborns [Annunziato; Donovan; Sauer].
b. Death and severe complications resulting in life-long disability.
c. Sexual side-effects and sensitivity-loss from circumcision [Kim; Sorrells].
d. Psychological consequences including infant analog of PTSD [Taddio], dissociation [Rhinehart], and addictive behaviors [Laumann].

What data does DHS collect about male circumcision?
DHS asks men, ""Are you circumcised?"" The possible responses are Yes, No and Don't Know. Over 30 surveys have collected this data.
What is male circumcision?
Male circumcision involves removing the foreskin, a loose fold of skin that covers the head of the penis. The procedure can be carried out at any stage: during infancy, childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Many societies have been practicing male circumcision for hundreds of years. Circumcision is often seen as a mark of belonging to a particular tribal or religious group.
What is the connection between male circumcision and HIV prevention?
Since the 1980s, scientists have suspected that male circumcision might reduce rates of HIV transmission during sex. They observed that circumcised men are less likely to have HIV than uncircumcised men, and HIV is less common among populations that traditionally practice male circumcision than in communities where the procedure is rare. However, for a long time it was unclear to what extent this was an effect of circumcision itself and whether other factors might also play a role.
Three randomized controlled trials (the results of which were published between 2005-07) have shown that male circumcision provided by well trained health professionals in properly equipped settings is safe. WHO/UNAIDS recommendations emphasize that male circumcision should be considered an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention in countries and regions with heterosexual epidemics, high HIV and low male circumcision prevalence. Male circumcision provides only partial protection, and therefore should be only one element of a comprehensive HIV prevention package.

Zambia
PSI/Zambia was established in 1992 to empower at-risk and underserved Zambians to lead healthier lives in line with the Government of Zambia’s health priorities. PSI/Zambia’s current portfolio contains programs in HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, malaria, safe water.
Health Areas
Child Survival, Diarrheal Disease, HIV, Malaria, Reproductive Health
Health Impact
In 2009, PSI/Zambia estimates that it averted more than 118,000 unwanted pregnancies, more than 922,000 episodes of diarrhea and more than 1,628,000 cases of malaria.
Health Interventions
Female CondomMale CondomHIV Counseling and Testing Male CircumcisionOral ContraceptionIntrauterine Device (IUD)Injectable ContraceptionContraceptive Implants
Improving Health in Zambia
HIV/AIDS Prevention
Male and Female Condom Social Marketing
SFH relaunched Maximum male condoms as Maximum Classic and Maximum Scented in 2004. Scented condoms play a critical role in providing choice and encouraging non-users and lapsed users to adopt the use of condoms and they provide cost recovery. SFH is the key organization focusing on sales and marketing activities for the female condom in Zambia. Care is distributed through several channels, including pharmacies, drug stores, hair salons, barbershops, and VCT centers and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations.
Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT)
In 2002, SFH began offering VCT services by opening a New Start center in downtown Lusaka. New Start now operates fixed sites in Kitwe, Chipata, Mansa, Solwezi, Ndola, Livingstone and two sites in Lusaka, as well as nine mobile VCT units. Together these sites counsel and test over 10,000 clients per month. SFH will launch a mass media campaign in 2009 to encourage couples to seek VCT services.
Male Circumcision (MC)
Clinical trials in South Africa, Uganda and Kenya estimate that a circumcised man is approximately 60% less likely to contract HIV than an uncircumcised man. Since 2007, SFH has offered male circumcision services through a combination of fixed sites, private sector franchises and mobile MC services through government hospitals and rural health centers.
Reproductive Health
Oral Contraceptives and Injectables
SFH’s portfolio comprises of MyChoice Microgynon oral contraceptives, MyChoice Injectable contraceptives, and SafePlan oral contraceptives. SFH assures the re-supply of both MyChoice products using a cost-recovery model. SFH works with private and public sector service providers as well as community-based distributors and health communications partners to improve the availability of contraceptive products.
Long-Term Methods
SFH seeks to improve reproductive, maternal and child health through improved access to and use of long-term family planning methods. Over the next few years, SFH will improve access to and use of IUDs and implants by supporting overburdened urban and under-supported rural MOH clinics, piloting immediate post-partum IUD insertion in collaboration with UTH and MOH, and improving the quality and range of RH services offered by private providers.
Prevention of Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH)
Post-partum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal deaths in Zambia. Most deliveries take place at home or in a rudimentary clinic that does not have sufficient trained staff, drugs or equipment to deal with the post-partum hemorrhage that contributes to 34% of all maternal mortality. Conclusive field studies have proven that a three-pill dose of the drug misoprostol, given to a woman immediately after she delivers, will significantly reduce PPH incidence. In addition to implementing its own PPH intervention, SFH will support the MOH’s pilot PPH prevention program.
Child Survival
Long Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets (LLINs)
SFH partners with the National Malaria Control Center in a nationwide project to distribute Mama Safenite LLINs in an effort to prevent malaria. As a national implementer of the Malaria in Pregnancy program, SFH has rolled out the program to all nine provinces. The program is managed throughout District Health Management Team centers and then through ante-natal clinics at district and ward levels, making free nets easily accessible to pregnant women and children under five.
Safe Water
Contaminated water is a leading cause of diarrheal disease in Zambia, where only 64% of the population has access to safe drinking water sources. Among children under five, 21% have had diarrhea in the past two weeks, regardless of water source or location. Mortality among children under five is particularly high, as attempts to rehydrate children, usually with more contaminated water, often fail. SFH launched Clorin in 1998 to protect low-income Zambians from contaminated water. Clorin is an inexpensive and simple-to-use household water treatment – a sodium hypochlorite disinfectant developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To date, the program has sold or distributed over 17 million bottles of Clorin, each of which protects a family of six for a month.

Circumcision decision is only for consenting grown-ups
Amanda Windsor/For The Times-Standardtimes-standard.com/

Genital cutting as a medical procedure rather than as a ritual sacrifice got its start as a Victorian fad treatment for masturbation. They blamed masturbation for many of the serious illnesses they could not understand or treat. A lot of Americans of my generation don't know this, but the foreskin is the most sensitive erogenous zone on the male body, and cutting it off was seen as a convenient “cure” for this problem of pleasure. Other treatments involved chastity belts and burning the head of the penis with hot pokers. I'll quote one of the fathers of medical genital cutting, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg: ”A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering anesthetic, as the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed.” The same “benefits” were also recommended for girls, and clitoridectomies (removal of the clitoris) were also performed. But even Dr. Kellogg thought circumcision was inappropriate for infants and could lead to problems later. Nevertheless, as more births began happening in Advertisementhospitals instead of at home, attended by doctors instead of midwives, the procedure began to be performed on infants more and more often. After World War II, doctors in all other industrialized nations rejected circumcision as harmful and unnecessary, but the U.S. followed a different path. Wartime military policy, the medicalization of childbirth, the adoption of a for-profit medical system instead of a public health service, and the opinions of popular figures such as Dr. Spock all played a role. Now the U.S. is also beginning to abandon the practice. Circumcision rates in the United States have dropped as low as one-third in recent years. I'm thrilled! Circumcision permanently removes 50 to 75 percent of a person's healthy erogenous tissue, is very painful, and has all of the same human rights issues as cutting girls and all of the risks that come with any surgery. What about those HIV results in Africa? The media likes to talk about a 50 percent risk reduction, and that sounds impressive, until you look at the numbers and discover that the risk was reduced from 3.38 percent to 1.58 percent. Not so exciting, and for each new study the benefit goes down; original studies suggested that cut men were eight times less likely to get HIV. Skeptical scientists suspect that when all the outside factors have been thought of and accounted for, there will be no benefit at all. These sorts of minuscule results are why no medical association in the world, not even in the U.S., recommends the surgery to prevent disease. I'll quote the American Medical Association: ”... behavioral factors are far more important risk factors for acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmissible diseases than circumcision status, and circumcision cannot be responsibly viewed as 'protecting' against such infections.” Ladies, would you cut off half or more of your happy parts for a reduction in your disease risk that's no better than the risks from the surgery? Would you like someone to surgically alter you to make you look just like your mother? Would you rather amputate your sensitive bits than go to all the work of washing them? Maybe you would. Hey, everybody's different, and I'm down with that. But maybe you wouldn't, and maybe it's time that guys have that freedom of choice too. Let's face it. Genital cutting is only for consenting grown-ups. A 2006 report estimated 100 neonatal circumcision-related deaths occur annually in the United States from anesthesia reaction, stroke, hemorrhage, and infection. A newborn has to be among the worst candidates for an unnecessary surgery. It's true that estimates of the annual number of deaths vary widely, everywhere from 2 to 2,000. Data on the number of injuries and unintentional amputations is also difficult to nail down. I can't wait for the number to certain: zero.

Circumcision could halt 4m new African HIV cases

More than four million new HIV infections could be prevented in Eastern and Southern Africa by 2025 if male circumcision rates were increased to 80%, researchers said on Tuesday.
Expanding circumcision services to 80% of adult and newborn males in the region would also save $20,2-billion in HIV-related health costs between 2009 and 2025, they said.
""With global resources spread thin, we must focus on expanding proven and cost-effective methods like male circumcision to prevent HIV transmission,"" Krishna Jafa, an HIV expert at health aid group Population Services International (PSI), said at an Aids conference in Vienna.
Jafa's comments echoed former US president Bill Clinton and philanthropist Bill Gates, who both used speeches to the conference to call for rapid scale-up of male circumcision as a cost-effective way to prevent the spread of HIV.
Sub-Saharan Africa carries the greatest burden of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes Aids, accounting for 67% of the 33,4-million people living with the virus worldwide. An estimated 1,9-million people were newly infected with HIV in the region in 2008.
Research cited by the World Health Organisation has shown that male circumcision can reduce a man's risk of getting HIV by up to 60%.
PSI presented results of a study from Zimbabwe, where researchers designed and tried out an efficiency model called Move, aimed at increasing the numbers of male circumcisions by using better techniques, training, equipment and staff.
In a pilot of the new system, a team of two doctors and three nurses was able to carry out four circumcisions at the same time and increase their rate from three operations per hour to 10, the results showed. Over 12 months of the pilot, around 6 500 men were circumcised.
The findings also showed the quality of the procedure was not compromised and there were no increases in the percentage of men reporting bad side effects afterwards. CONTINUES BELOW

In March 2007, the WHO and United Nations UNAids group recommended male circumcision as an effective HIV prevention.
The PSI study found that in Zimbabwe alone, which has an adult HIV rate of 13,7% and a male circumcision rate of just over 10%, 750 000 new HIV infections could be prevented if 80% of men were to be circumcised. It also found there was high demand for the procedure.
Bill Gates, whose Gates Foundation spends much of its $34-billion fund on fighting HIV, told the Aids conference on Monday he had been surprised by the number of men in Africa who wanted to be circumcised to reduce their risk of contracting HIV.
""I was doubtful that a large number of men would sign up for it. I'm glad to say I was wrong,"" he said. ""Wherever there are clinics available, men are volunteering to be circumcised in huge numbers -- far more than I expected.""
But Gates said while more than 41-million men in sub-Saharan Africa could benefit from it, only 150 000 have been circumcised in the past few years. - Reuters

HIV Transmission
Male circumcision can reduce HIV transmission by up to 76% revealed researchers at the annual International Aids Society Conference in Rome on Wednesday.
This is the first study to show that this male surgical procedure could help effectively prevent HIV within communities.
The data comes from a study conducted in Orange Farm, South Africa where free circumcisions were offered to men over the age of 15. During the course of 3 years more than 20,000 men underwent this operation, reaching nearly 60% of young men from15-24 years of age within the community.
At the end of the study the prevalence of HIV within this town was reduced by 55% and there was a 77% reduction in HIV incidence in circumcised men.
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) commented on the study saying they “strongly” welcomed the results and feel that encouraging adult male circumcision is a step in the right direction for HIV prevention.
“Science is proving that we are at the tipping point of the epidemic,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “Urgent action is now needed to close the gap between science and implementation to reach the millions of people who are waiting for these discoveries. Scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision services rapidly to young men in high HIV prevalence settings will help reach the 2015 goal of reducing sexual transmission of HIV by 50%.”
African countries, such as Kenya, have already taken the lead in using circumcision for disease prevention. Over the last several years more than 290,000 men have been given this operation for free. Tanzani has also followed in suit, pledging to circumcise at least 2.8 million men over 5 years. Already, in 6 weeks more than 10,000 procedures have been performed.
In Swaziland, which has the highest HIV transmission rates in the world, it is estimated that their plan to circumcise nearly 153,000 men could help save $600 million over the next ten years.
However, despite the dramatic advances taken in reducing the HIV transmission epidemic, the UNAIDS cautions that this surgical procedure is not a guarantee protection against infection and, to date, there still is no single method which can be used to prevent the disease. A combination of preventive measures such as circumcision, barrier contraceptive methods, reducing the number of sexual partners, and antiretroviral therapy should all be used when appropriate.

Jhpiego Collaboration on Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Offers Innovative Response to Health Care Worker Shortage in Mozambique

Tue, 10/25/2011 - 16:02 — alolordo
By Mehebub Kassim Mahomed and Edgar Necochea
Maputo, MZ.—Mozambique health facilities are successfully integrating voluntary medical male circumcision into their minor surgery work as part of a Jhpiego-supported initiative. This partnership is leading to a steady increase in use of this HIV prevention practice, with more than 22,000 men circumcised.
Facing an acute shortage of health care workers in the country, the Mozambique Ministry of Health (MOH) requested Jhpiego’s support to explore an integrated approach that would strengthen minor surgical services, including the provision of medical male circumcision. This approach would capitalize upon the skills of trained personnel (mainly nurses) who are already performing minor surgical procedures. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded this innovative, collaborative effort that focused on building the capacity of health care workers to provide male circumcision (MC) as part of their health services.
Throughout the 21-month partnership, nurses performed 80 percent of the procedures in seven health facilities. Young men, ages 15‒19, represented about a third of the 22,479 clients who opted for voluntary medical male circumcision. Men who ranged in age from 20‒34—a clientele often more difficult to reach – represented 28.4 percent, an exceedingly successful outcome.
An overwhelming 94 percent of clients were so pleased with the service at their facility that they said they would encourage a friend or family member to attend, and clients reported an overall satisfaction rate of 97.8 percent with their experience.
Experts estimate that for every 13 medical male circumcision procedures conducted in Mozambique, one new HIV infection will be averted by the year 2025. Transferring these calculations to procedures performed through September 2011 means that the Jhpiego-supported demonstration project contributed to averting an estimated 1,729 new HIV infections. Overall, expanding access to MC to reach 80 percent of adult and newborn males in Mozambique by 2015 would avert more than 300,000 adult HIV infections between 2009 and 2025, and yield total net savings of more than $1.5 billion between 2009 and 2025 in treatment costs.
Jhpiego conducted the demonstration program from November 2009 through November 2010, initially at four sites in two provinces and Maputo City, where HIV prevalence rates are greater than the 11.5 percent national average and MC rates are lower than average for the country. Selected facilities included a basic health center, a rural hospital, a general hospital in an urban center and a military hospital. Staff in charge of the program were trained in the forceps-guided MC technique, basic minor surgery practices including local anesthesia, infection prevention measures, quality assurance and management of complications.
During the pilot, Jhpiego tested service delivery models and collected data on actual and potential productivity of the joint services in the country (including implications for human resources, infrastructure, equipment and materials, and operational systems), as well as on existing demand for such services. An extensive report was submitted to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the MOH in December 2010, with an initial proposal for expansion. Services continued at the four initial sites, and were then expanded in a second phase to three additional sites in Maputo City and two additional provinces through July 2011.
The monthly complication rate at the facilities declined steadily during the program’s duration, averaging less than 1 percent per month; most complications were mild. On average, facilities complied with 89 percent of quality assurance standards.
As part of the program, clients seeking minor surgery and MC services received HIV counseling and testing. Of the 22,954 men counseled and tested, 997 tested positive for HIV and were referred for treatment. Treatment referrals will continue to be a major focus of the program.
Ministry officials have endorsed the approach and are supporting greater expansion of the program. Among the recommendations for the expansion:
Prioritize high-volume units, in areas of high HIV prevalence, to increase efficiency and productivity.
Guarantee that the training is competency-based.
Form teams of providers (nurses and technicians) who can operate in the facilities under the supervision of surgeons, physicians and/or surgical technicians.
Guarantee a referral system for moderate and severe complications.
Plan, organize and control the supply chain to avoid stock-outs.
Jhpiego is currently tasked with serving 90,000 additional MC clients by the end of this program year, June 14, 2012. Establishment of services is under way in three new sites, and greater expansion is already planned for the next program year.
Among the beneficiaries of the Jhpiego demonstration project was S. Mutego, 39, of Matola. He is a counselor at the Minor Surgery and Male Circumcision Service of Maputo Military Hospital, one of the initial four project sites. This father of two children is in charge of group counseling for prospective MC clients. He explains the benefits and risks of MC, wound care after surgery, HIV prevention, and individual counseling and testing for HIV.
After working as a counselor at the military hospital for 18 months, Mutego decided to undergo an MC procedure. Through his work, he realized that a traditional circumcision performed on him as a boy had not properly completed the procedure. Mutego was nervous at first, he says, but soon he became relaxed because he did not feel any pain. He recovered quickly and without any complications.
Mutego is very pleased with the outcome of his surgery. The six-week postoperative abstinence period has passed, and he plans to bring his two sons for circumcision at the military hospital during their next school holiday.

8th HIV Sentinel Serosurveillance Report""The biennial HIV sentinel surveys among pregnant women aged 15-49 years attending antenatal care in various health facilities in the country have regularly been conducted in the last decade to monitor the magnitude and the progress of the epidemic. This leaflet highlights the findings of the 8th sentinel survey carried in the year 2002 and shows trends of the HIV epidemic in Swaziland since 1992 to 2002. The objectives of the sentinel surveillance were the following: to determine the prevalence of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B infections among pregnant women attending antenatal care services; to monitor trends of HIV. Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant women; to determine the distribution of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B in different age groups, marital status and educational status among pregnant women; to determine the prevalence of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B between the 4 regions and by urban/rural strata; and to collect HIV data that will enable HIV/AIDS projections in the future.""

Battling bilharzia: SwazilandBilharzia, or schistosomiasis, is a disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Throughout the tropics and subtropics, up to 300 million people are infected, making bilharzia second only to malaria in terms of its socio-economic and public health importance in these areas. A collaborative project involving the Swaziland Institute for Research in Traditional Medicine, Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants (SIREMIFOP), the Bilharzia Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the School of Environmental Sciences and Development of the University of Potchefstroom, South Africa and Legesse Wolde-Yohannes, an endod specialist from Ethiopia, together with rural development centres in Ntfonjeni Inkhundla and Manzini North Inkhundla has been initiated. It is a community outreach project involving the cultivation of endod (Phytolacca dodecandra) for the control of bilharzia in rural communities where the disease is endemic. The two rural communities participate in the cultivation of endod, prepare a powder from the harvest of berries, and apply given doses of the powder to ponds infested with bilharzia-transmitting snails. The outreach programme has also been extended to field workers, who are given the task of controlling parasitic diseases in the country and of providing technical know-how on the epidemiology of diseases. Throughout the project, research findings have been applied at the grassroots level using simple, unsophisticated technology for the benefit of local communities.

Costing Male Circumcision in Swaziland and Implications for the Cost-Effectiveness of Circumcision as an HIV Intervention""Clinical trials have now confirmed the efficacy of male circumcision (MC) in reducing female-to-male HIV transmission. Some cost data have been reported (ranging between US$25 and US$69) and these cost data also formed the basis of a cost-effectiveness analysis. It is unclear, however, what exactly is included in the costing studies and hence whether these costs are directly comparable. For example, often, indirect costs are not fully reflected; donations (especially clinicians’ time) are not costed; and variation by provider type and level of health facility is not considered. It is anticipated that this cost analysis will provide a more detailed examination of the costs of male circumcision and inform a sounder basis for an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of MC and planning for implementation of MC in Swaziland. This analysis is part of a larger study titled the 'Costing Male Circumcision in Lesotho, Swaziland, and Zambia: Implications for Cost-Effectiveness of Circumcision as an HIV Intervention.' The larger study has two major components: (1) costing MC and (2) modeling the impact of MC on the HIV epidemic. The purpose of the analysis in Swaziland was to (1) understand the social, cultural, and policy context of male circumcision; (2) assess the cost of providing adult MC in a resource-constrained setting; and (3) evaluate the implications of scaling up MC for the cost-effectiveness of MC and for the health system (e.g., resource mobilization and health system capacity).""

Helping Ourselves: Community Responses to AIDS in Swaziland""In March 2005, a Joint Mission of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) and UNAIDS, led by Dr Peter Piot (Executive Director, UNAIDS) visited The Kingdom of Swaziland to see some of the community-based HIV programmes that have been developed there. In a country severely affected by the epidemic, these community programmes represent innovative and inspirational methods for supporting people infected with and affected by HIV, particularly orphaned and vulnerable children. The Joint Mission visited the community of Mambatfweni in Manzini region where community initiatives are based on several interconnected elements: building a community KaGogo social centre to coordinate efforts to respond to the epidemic and its impacts; establishing a system of Neighbourhood Care Points to feed orphaned and other vulnerable children, teach them basic life skills and give them care and support within the community; reintroducing traditional community Indlunkhulu fields to help grow food for the sick and vulnerable; establishing community support structures for people living with HIV; providing psychosocial support programmes; and strengthening community outreach services. Mambatfweni is not unique in developing these community efforts. Similar community-based initiatives are being rolled out and scaled up across the country and have become the foundation stones of the national response in Swaziland, now facing (in 2005) the highest recorded prevalence in the world.""

HIV/AIDS in the Umbufto Swaziland Defence Force""Up to now no comprehensive study has been produced that analyses the HIV/AIDS situation in the Umbufto Swaziland Defence Force (USDF). This is in spite of the fact that the military is a high-risk sector both within itself and in its relationships with local, regional, continental and global communities. This chapter analyses the HIV/AIDS situation in the USDF, with particular emphasis on the manner in which the Swaziland military has reacted to the general advent of HIV/AIDS.""

Integrating quality postnatal care into PMTCT in SwazilandSwaziland's prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme is linked to maternal and newborn health (MNH) services, but is mainly focussed on HIV/AIDS. Existing MNH services are inadequate, especially postnatal care (PNC) of mothers and babies, with delayed postnatal visits occurring at 4-6 weeks after delivery. Fifty-seven percent of staff in seven Swazi health facilities were trained in promoting and providing early PNC.Afinal evaluation showed a 20-fold increase in the number of visits coming for an early postnatal visit (within the first three days after birth). A direct observation of the client_provider interaction showed a significant increase in the competence of the health workers related to postnatal examinations, and care of mothers and babies (pB0.05_B0.01). The percentage of women breastfeeding within one hour of delivery increased by 41% in HIV-positive mothers and 52% in HIV-negative mothers. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants increased by 24%. Although, health workers were observed providing counselling, maternal recall of messages was deficient, suggesting the need for additional strategies for promoting healthy behaviours. High-quality integrated PMTCT programmes and MNH postnatal services are feasible and acceptable, and can result in promoting early postnatal visits and improved care of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers and their babies.

Monitoring the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) – Swaziland Country Report""Swaziland is among the countries hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Since the first AIDS cases were reported in the country in 1986, the disease has spread at an alarming rate. The general mode of HIV transmission remains heterosexual, with some new infections occurring as a result of mother-to-child transmission. The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women rose from 3.9% in 1992 to 42.9% in 2004 (Sentinel Surveillance Report 2004). However, the 10th sentinel surveillance in 2006 showed a slight drop to 39.2%. HIV prevalence in the 15-24 age group remained steady at 39.4% between 2002 and 2004 and showed a decline to 34.6% in 2006. A consistent decline in the 15-19 year age group (from 32.5% to 26%) was recorded between 2002 and 2006. 3 According to the 2006/7 SDHS, the overall HIV prevalence in the population aged 15-49 is 26% with women (31%) more likely to be HIV positive than men 20%). The estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) that are in need of combined ARV treatment has increased from approximately 43,157 in 2004 to 58,250 in 2007 (HIV Estimation and Projections for Swaziland, Draft Workshop Report, November 2007).""
Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV guidelines""Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) is by far the largest source of HIV infection in children. According to UNAIDS estimates, more than 90 percent of children acquire HIV through MTCT during pregnancy, during labor and delivery or after delivery through breastfeeding. HIV exposed or infected infants have a high probability (50%) of dying in the first two years of life. Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services provides an entry point to prevention of HIV transmission to infants and care and treatment for the entire family. The high HIV prevalence among pregnant women of 42.6% (MOH&SW Sentinel Surveillance 2004) indicates that if interventions to prevent MTCT are not scaled-up, paediatric HIV infections will continue to reverse the gains made in child survival through EPI and safe motherhood initiatives. In the light of the above, the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland is committed to providing equitable access to cost effective and quality health care as close to the family as possible through the involvement of community-based health workers. It is within this context that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOH&SW) is working towards increasing access to PMTCT, Care and Treatment services for all pregnant women, mothers, infants and their families. This will be achieved through the expansion and integration of PMTCT services into routine maternal and child health (MCH) services. PMTCT has been identified as a viable intervention to reduce new HIV infections through a four prong approach: 1) primary prevention of HIV infection among women of child bearing age, 2) prevention of unintended pregnancies among HIV infected women; 3) prevention of HIV transmission from HIV infected mothers to the infants and 4) provision of continuous care and treatment for infected mothers, partners and their children. Therefore implementation of a PMTCT programme includes establishment of linkages to other support programmes within the framework of a continuum of care for people infected and affected by HIV. This 2nd Edition is an update of the PMTCT Guidelines developed in 2002 and has incorporated new WHO recommended public health approaches in HIV Prevention, Care and Treatment.""

Repositioning Postnatal Care in a High HIV Environment: Swaziland""Recognizing the need to improve the care and follow up of mothers and infants in the postnatal period, the Swaziland Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), with support from the Horizons Program of Population Council, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), Basics Support for Institutionalising Child Survival (BASICS), and the Central Statistics Office (CSO), carried out an operations research project to reposition postnatal care (PNC) within the context of a high HIV environment. The objectives of the study were to determine if changes to the sexual and reproductive health guidelines on postnatal care would result in the timely and quality provision of key components of essential maternal and newborn care in the postnatal period, increase utilization of postnatal care services among all postpartum (PP) women, and improve the care and follow up of HIV-positive postpartum women and their infants.""

Seven years of regional malaria control collaboration — Mozambique, South Africa, and SwazilandThe Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative is a joint development program between the governments of Mozambique, Swaziland, and South Africa, which includes malaria control as a core component of the initiative. Vector control through indoor residual spraying (IRS) was incrementally introduced in southern Mozambique between November 2000 and February 2004. Surveillance to monitor its impact was conducted by annual cross-sectional surveys to assess the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection, entomologic monitoring, and malaria case notification in neighboring South Africa and Swaziland. In southern Mozambique, there was a significant reduction in P. falciparum prevalence after the implementation of IRS, with an overall relative risk of 0.74 for each intervention year (P < 0.001), ranging from 0.66 after the first year to 0.93 after the fifth intervention year. Substantial reductions in notified malaria cases were reported in South Africa and Swaziland over the same period. The success of the program in reducing malaria transmission throughout the target area provides a strong argument for investment in regional malaria control.

Traditional Medicine: SwazilandPlants are used extensively in Swazi traditional medicine. In the 1970s, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Swaziland decided to examine the scientific basis for this traditional medical system. In the process of researching drugs derived from medicinal plants, researchers began to understand the important cultural heritage that supported this system. The work has involved analyses of medicinal plants collected by rural people familiar with the traditional medical system. A key part of the studies are the ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants administered by traditional medical practitioners (TMP's) and the taxonomic identification of plant species by taxonomists with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. Chemical screening and extraction of possible active constituents is also conducted with TMPs as an integral part of the laboratory team… Today, this work is housed in the Swaziland Center for Research in Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants. As a result of the center's research on medicinal plants, the scientific bases of the use of traditional plants for therapeutic purposes has been established.

Report Card – HIV Prevention for Girls and Young Women: Swaziland""This report card aims to provide a summary of HIV prevention for girls and young women in Swaziland. This Report Card is one in a series produced by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), under the umbrella of the Global Coalition on Women and AIDS, and with the support of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and Young Positives. The Report Card is an advocacy tool. It aims to increase and improve the programmatic, policy and funding actions taken on HIV prevention for girls and young women in Swaziland. Its key audiences are national, regional and international policy and decision-makers, and service providers. It builds on global policy commitments, particularly those outlined in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS from the 2 June 2006 High-Level Meeting, to follow up on the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on AIDS (UNGASS). The Report Card summarizes the current situation of HIV prevention strategies and services for girls and young women ages 15-24 years in Swaziland. It contains an analysis of five key components that influence HIV prevention, namely: 1. Legal provision; 2. Policy provision; 3. Availability of services; 4. Accessibility of services; [and] 5. Participation and rights. It also provides recommendations for key stakeholders to enhance action on HIV prevention strategies and services for girls and young women in Swaziland. The Report Card is the basis of extensive research carried out during 2007 by IPPF, involving both desk research on published data and reports, and in-country research in Swaziland to provide more qualitative information. This research is detailed in full within a 'Research Dossier on HIV Prevention for Girls and Young Women in Swaziland’(available on request from IPPF)."" [c2007]

Government leaders make statements in recognition of World AIDS Day

A number of government leaders made statements on Thursday in recognition of World AIDS Day. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a press statement said, ""We have come a long way in the fight against AIDS, but there is still a long road ahead to realize our ambitious goals. If we continue to work together and coordinate a global effort guided by science, we may one day live in an AIDS-free generation"" (12/1). In a post on the White House Blog, Gayle Smith, special assistant to the President, and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Eric Goosby write, ""As President Obama made clear, the fight against global AIDS is a shared responsibility, not one the U.S. can meet alone. … As we move forward, we will work with a growing number of partners as the global community joins the U.S. in a heightened focus on this fight"" (12/1).In a Huffington Post opinion piece, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah writes, ""Today, as we once again mark World AIDS Day, we should do so knowing the world finally has the ability to create a future without AIDS."" He adds, ""To realize the future of an AIDS-free generation, we have to strategically focus our efforts on proven, cost-effective ways to fight against HIV/AIDS: stopping mother-to-child transmission, expanding voluntary medical male circumcision, supporting community adherence and investing in new biomedical tools"" (12/1).This article was reprinted from kaiserhealthnews.org with permission from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent news service, is a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care policy research organization unaffiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

Avoid Circumcision
Ronald Goldman, Ph.D.
says:
December 5, 2011 at 5:57 PM
Many professionals have criticized the studies claiming that circumcision reduces HIV transmission. They have various flaws. Authorities that cite the studies have other agendas. Circumcision causes physical, sexual, and psychological harm. Other methods to prevent HIV transmission (e.g., condoms and sterilizing medical instruments) are much more effective, much cheaper, and much less invasive.

INTACT AMERICA AT AIDS 2010
Intact America takes its message abroad to the International AIDS 2010 Conference in Vienna, Austria from July 18-23. Intactivist volunteers are staffing our booth at the conference, with banners, brochures, and other educational materials from Intact America. Right now, the issue of AIDS – and the fact that circumcision does NOT prevent it – is central to both the CDC's and the AAP's upcoming recommendations for America's baby boys. Read the press release. UPDATE: We need your help to make our message heard. Will you make a donation to help support our presence at the AIDS 2010 conference in Vienna? (Pictured at right: Brian O'Donnell and Aubrey Taylor. Photo by Michael Smith.)
Circumcision and Sexually Transmitted Infections (including HIV)
Intact America opposes the promotion of circumcision as a method for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Physicians and others who would promote circumcision have a long history of claiming medical beneﬁts to justify genital cutting of both males and females that were subsequently disproved. HIV/AIDS is the latest in a long list of diseases that have held out as a justiﬁcation for circumcision. It is socially irresponsible and dangerous to promote a message that circumcision offers protection from sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, when such protection – if it exists at all – is only partial, and comes at a great expense and risk to others. Circumcised men can both contract and transmit sexually transmitted infections. The only way to prevent such infections is through abstinence or “safe sex” practices, including the use of condoms. (Pictured at right: Brian O'Donnell with Michel Sidibé, the new Executive Director of UN-AIDS. Photo by Michael Smith.)
Male Circumcision: A Dangerous Mistake in the HIV Battle
Mass male circumcision has been identified and promoted as a method of curbing the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, following the results of three randomized clinical field trials (RCTs) conducted there. Analysis of these studies reveals many factors that call in to question the results claimed and limit their applicability to the circumcision debate in the United States. Our full analysis is available here.

The End of the Epidemic, Spray-on Prophylactic, Herpes and HIV, and The Future of MC & HIV
The End of the Epidemic?
The Independent reported this month that the World Health Organization believes the world-wide threat of a generalized epidemic has in fact passed. The story is rather long, but the message in a few words is that the disease outside of Africa remains and looks to remain localized and concentrated in sub-populations that engage in behaviors necessary for its spread, namely among marginalized people who inject illegal drugs, among sex workers, and in gay men whose sexual networks coincidentally mirror those of sub-Saharan Africa, i.e. multiple concurrent partnerships. (It bears noting that this last category is not all inclusive. Those most at risk are the gay men who maintain such networks, which isn't to say that this makes up a majority of gay men.)
This is a courageous statement. It goes against the two decade juggernaut that would rather use fear and hype to maintain attention on the problem than the humanitarian aspects of infection to keep the money flowing. To be fair, I'm not sure that this approach wasn't necessary given the world's antipathy towards the most affected groups. But it has had its counterproductive fall-out.
Again, contrary to Halperin and Bailey and Gray and their acolytes, a concentrated, targeted response is still the best approach all things considered.
Spray-on Prophylactic?
Aidsmap has a more considered discussion on the recently reported research that spraying Estrogen on the penis could produce a barrier of keratin that may reduce the risk of HIV infection. Aidsmap interprets the study as a possible way for intact men to gain the benefits of circumcision without being circumcised. But as usual, the tone of the article belies the assumption that circumcision is the gold standard and spraying hormones is the next best thing. Again, the romance of circumcision continues to weave its way into the discourse.
Nevertheless, at least Aidsmap gives the reader a more nuanced view behind the idea.
Treating Herpes Still Not Predictive of HIV Infection
In a final report on research started some time ago to assess whether treating herpes with suppressive drug therapy would reduce rates of HIV infection, researchers have concluded that the approach has no apparent effect in reducing HIV in women and gay men.
This is contrary to the by-now common belief viz circumcision where the mechanism of reduction in transmission has been pinned on the reduction of ulcerative diseases in circumcised men. Of course, numerous studies have failed to demonstrate this. In fact, the literature is replete with contradictory studies viz the reduction of STDs in circumcised men. Demographic studies have also shown circumcision provides no predictive value of relative rates of HIV.
(It of course bears noting here that other research has concluded that the groups studied, women and gay men, receive no protective benefit from circumcision.)
An objective view would seem to support that STDs are simply not a risk factor for contracting HIV although they remain a predictor of risky behavior conducive to HIV transmission.
The Future of MC & HIV
June has been a lean month for the blog. It's not that there hasn't been news to report and comment on. In fact, this has been a busy month over all for that. However, the present model is less effective in keeping this website current and timely. I'm working on coming up with a sustainable solution.
In the mean time, I would point you towards this article on the ""anti-preneurs."" Is this method of economic support a possible avenue for influencing the public debate? Note the no-commercial radio station. I hope you will leave comments to this post on what you want to see here and how you would support it.
Thanks for reading.

About
Male Circumcision and HIV provides a place for a public health policy debate on the linking of male circumcision and HIV/AIDS. It seeks to address questions of cost versus benefit, the effectiveness of circumcision in the fight against HIV/AIDS in real world settings, and the differing points of view of researchers, the media, and all contributors to the policy discussion.

Kenya: Traditional Male Circumcision With a Modern Edge
allAfrica.com, 16 March 2012
A chorus of ululations pierces the dawn at Pius Nyaga's homestead in eastern Kenya, marking the end of a brief ritual near the family cowshed. Nyaga's son, Antony Mwiti, has just completed the rite of passage into manhood - the traditional way.

ASSOCIATED FACTORS: EVIDENCE FROM NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS""
""There appears no clear pattern of association between male circumcision
and HIV prevalence—in 8 of 18 countries with data, HIV prevalence is
lower among circumcised men, while in the remaining 10 countries it is
higher.""
http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/CR22/CR22.pdfThe South African National Communication Survey on HIV/AIDS, 2009 found
that 15% of adults across age groups ""believe that circumcised men do not
need to use condoms"".
http://www.info.gov.za/issues/hiv/survey_2009.htmFrom the committee of the South African Medical Association Human Rights,
Law & Ethics Committee :
""the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough
scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions
prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by
incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view
that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.""The one randomized controlled trial into male-to-female transmission showed
a 54% higher rate in the group where the men had been circumcised btw:

forward. Promoting genital surgery will cost African lives, not save them.

Circumcision is a hoax, being used to play Africans as fools. A few
pro-cutting people got together, and formed a group, and said, ""How can we
do this?"" I know this sounds crazy. Want proof? Go to circleaks.com,
people, Daniel Halperin, and click on the link for reference 2, the second
part, not the first. There, for all to see, are the names of some of
authors of studies which 'proved' that circumcision reduces HIV by 60%.
rcbailey? Wasn't it Robert C. Bailey who did one of the studies, along
with Stephen Moses. There is an smoses on the list. Along with them, are
the heads of organizations who get off on circumcision as a sexual thing.
Dr. Gray published studies with Brian Morris, who has long been associated
with promoting circumcision for bathroom splatter, to prevent injury to the
foreskin, and so the foreskin can't get caught in a zipper.
Everybody knows it doesn't actually stop HIV. We in the US have watched
hundreds of thousands of circumcised men die of AIDS.
It is really time for Africa to wake up, and know that circumcision is a
distraction from real prevention.
Condoms work. They protect both partners, not just the man.

Real Evidence? Forget about it! We have mathematical models.
What do you do when the real world fails to cooperate and instead gives you evidence contrary to expectations? Well, naturally you ignore the evidence and use complex speculation instead.
The only sustained objection in litigation worse than relevance is speculation. A sustained relevance objection often means the cross examiner has nowhere to go with his questioning. Speculation on the other hand often points to a witness's underhanded attempt to distract or mislead the jury. And speculation is what a gratuitous mathematical model is.
Experts get to speculate sometimes, but not when there is perfectly good evidence available -- in this case epidemiological evidence. Why turn to modeling when you can turn to real data, such as was done by Talbott? Because the real data in this case won't help you sell the goods.
And so, here we go again with not social scientists but mathematics professors! That's right. Now the mathematicians have been recruited to show how magical [abstract] all this talk about circumcision is.
This study concludes with not so famous last words, ... an intervention will fail if
steps are not taken to prevent the majority of men increasing their
sexual activity due to overestimation of circumcision's benefits.*There you have it, the great unknown variable. And as has been seen, circumcised men begin to approximate behavior of their uncircumcised brethren in a more permissive environment, thereby raising their infection levels to the average of their communities.
*Edit: I just noticed that the authors' conclusion is in fact contradicted overstated in the abstract by this observation: These benefits are lessened with
increasing sexual activity in men who have been circumcised, with
complete negation of the intervention occuring once a lower bound of
40% of men increase their activity.
Yeah, so forget a ""majority of men increasing their sexual activity."" You need a mere 40% to negate the benefit. But again, we already knew circumcision fails as an HIV public health measure from the epidemiological evidence.
Apologies for the heavy linkage.

About
Male Circumcision and HIV provides a place for a public health policy debate on the linking of male circumcision and HIV/AIDS. It seeks to address questions of cost versus benefit, the effectiveness of circumcision in the fight against HIV/AIDS in real world settings, and the differing points of view of researchers, the media, and all contributors to the policy discussion.

A Compact Guide to Pros and Contras of Removal of Penile Foreskin Surgery
Posted by admin on May 7, 2011
The operation of foreskin removal from the penis, known as well as circumcision, has its own medical pros and contras. On the one hand, the circumcision brings obvious benefits to the patient. On the other hand, it is connected with certain risks. The benefits are as follows: much less risk of acquiring a urinary tract infection; the same goes for diseases transmitted through having sex and even for penile cancer. Among the involved risks one finds: the surgery might be quite painful, there is a possibility, though not significant, of bleeding or getting an infection. The older the person – a baby, a boy, an adult man – the higher the risks become.
According to reputable sources of medical clinical research there are certain evidences that the circumcision brings down the risks of some adverse conditions for male infants, such as:
Emergence of penis cancer
Diseases that most often are transmitted by the way of a sexual intercourse (including HIV that leads to deadly AIDS)
Various penile infectious diseases
The syndrome of a very tight foreskin that practically “glues” it to the penis head and prevents it from retracting because the opening is too small(phimosis)
Infectious diseases of the urinary tract.
What ate the actual risks of the circumcision surgery? All in all, they are as follows:
Possibility of bleeding.
Possibility of catching some infection or a chance that the penis will be traumatized.
The surgery leaves the foreskin around the penis head very red, raw and sensitive.
Are there any considerable benefits acquired through this surgery operation?
The well-established health benefits of the circumcision include:
Better and more convenient penile hygiene. A circumcised penis is much easier to wash thoroughly (though it should be admitted that washing of an uncircumcised does not require so much trouble either).
The risk of getting a urinary tract infection is significantly decreased. Though the serious risk of getting a problem with urinary tract infection during the first year of infancy is not very high, the research demonstrates that uncircumcised baby boys are up to 10 times more likely to acquire it than the circumcised ones. Ant the adverse effects of the infection suffered so early in life can later become the cause for kidney problems.
Some penile problems are avoided. For instance it happens so that an uncircumcised baby boy suffers from phimosis that means too small opening of the foreskin, which makes it difficult or impossible to retract the skin. This can results in inflammation of the penis head.
The risk of emergency of penile cancer is much lower. As was demonstrated by statistics research, the number of cases with cancer of the penis happens to be noticeably lower among the circumcised men.
Much fewer chances to catch some disease that is commonly transmitted through the sexual intercourse. Of course, one should make it a habit to practice safe sex or none. Nevertheless, circumcised men are slightly less likely to get certain sexually transmitted diseases, including the very dangerous HIV, the virus, which can cause the deadly AIDS.
Are there any disadvantages to the circumcision method?
Yes, we regret to say, there are some disadvantages to this method. They are as follows:
The risks caused by the necessity to undergo surgery. There is a possibility – though a very slight, but still real – to suffer bleeding and infection. Even the most experienced professionals do make mistakes – and your foreskin may be cut too short or too long. It is also possible that you will suffer problems with proper healing after the surgery. In some cases the remaining foreskin attaches itself back to the penis head, so another surgery is required to correct the irregularity.
The surgery is painful. It really hurts when being circumcised. Local anesthesia is required; otherwise a patient will not be able to stand it to the end of operation.
Circumcision is not a major operation and is commonly done in the hospital as an ambulatory procedure by using local anesthesia. For very small children, general anesthesia is recommended.
But as the practice shows, the chances to get problems after circumcision are very low. Anyway, do not hesitate to contact the doctor in the following cases:
Upon six to eight hours after the circumcision your son is not able to urinate in a normal way.
The area of the circumcision is constantly bleeding, is very raw and red.
The area of the circumcision exudes foul smell, you see sores that are covered with crust, it oozes some fluids.

Circumcision and HIV
There were several studies conducted in Africa during the 1980s that suggested that those men who were not circumcised had a higher risk of contracting HIV. The studies were conducted using information from maps, high risk populations, as well as the individuals that visited STD health clinics. The information in these studies resulted in a conclusion that men who were not circumcised had a greater chance of contracting HIV through unsafe sex and other risky activities. However, several studies that were performed on random populations in Africa have shown that men who are circumcised re actually more likely to have HIV infections.
Medical literature makes this very confusing because it is frequently stated that a male’s foreskin places him at a high risk for contracting HIV. Locations in Africa that practice male circumcision found that HIV seroprevalence was much lower than in places that don’t practice circumcision in Africa. Information that could affect the study like when the individual first had sex, whether they were monogamous, and other factors were not considered. Circumcision data from the 1950s was used because it was decided that it had not changed since then. It was noticed that in areas that had high levels of circumcision also had high levels of HIV.
The idea that circumcision could help reduce the spread of HIV is not correct and it is actually dangerous to think this because it could result in males involving themselves in unsafe sexual situations.
There are other studies, like those from the WHO, that correlate HIV infection with individuals who have not been circumcised. With so much contradicting information floating around it is difficult for people to determine what is right and what is not.
The most important thing to keep in mind in regards to circumcision and HIV is that it won’t prevent an HIV infection. Males who are circumcised and those who are not should always take care to prevent themselves from being exposed to HIV and other STDs. There is no way to prevent HIV and STDs in males regardless of whether they are circumcised or not other than through abstinence.
Due to this, parents should consider the other benefits and risks of circumcision before deciding whether or not they should circumcise their child.

Guardian examines Swaziland's HIV epidemic

The Guardian examines the HIV epidemic in Swaziland, writing, ""While neighboring countries have made inroads against the disease, the mountain kingdom of one million people continues to suffer setbacks, partly due to cultural norms around sexuality being exacerbated by a financial crisis."" According to the news service, Swaziland has ""the highest HIV rate in the world, with more than one in four adults estimated to be carrying the virus."" ""Research has found that, despite government information campaigns, understanding of HIV/AIDS is poor,"" the Guardian writes, adding, ""A campaign funded by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to encourage men to undergo circumcision -- not a tradition in Swaziland -- fell well short of its target."" However, ""circumcision of newborn boys is proving more successful,"" and ""[t]he government has also achieved 78 percent coverage of people who need antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and can now conduct tests within the country instead of having to send samples to South Africa,"" the news service notes (Smith, 4/11).This article was reprinted from kaiserhealthnews.org with permission from the Henry J.

Get them before they can fight back!
Hugh Intactive

There is NO evidence that circumcising babies has any effect on HIV transmission. Such evidence as there is that circumcising men has an effect is heavily contaminated by the context of adult circumcision - waiting in rooms with safe-sex literature, being exposed to counselling, etc. If men resist being circumcised, it is for the very good reason that their foreskin is an important part of their sexual equipment that they're unwilling to give up. But never mind such trivial issues as men's pleasure or medical ethics or efficacy - circumcise them as babies before they can resist or find out what they're going to miss. In Swaziland, 21.8% of circumcised men have HIV, and 19.5% of non-circumised men. (And USAID found similar differences in 10 out of 18 countries for which it had figures.) A study in Uganda started to find that circumcising men INcreases the risk to women, who are already at greater risk (but it was cut short before that could be confirmed). So how can circumcising males help against HIV?

Circumcision of infants is ""more successful""
Ronald Goldman, Ph.D.

Circumcision of infants is ""more successful"" because it can be done by force, and they cannot resist. Circumcision causes significant pain and trauma, behavioral and neurological changes in infants, potential parental stress from persistent crying (colic) of infants, disrupted bonding between parent and child, and risk of surgical complications. Other consequences of circumcision include loss of a natural, healthy, functioning body part, reduced sexual pleasure, potential psychological problems, and unknown negative effects that have not been studied. Some circumcised men resent that they are circumcised. Sexual anxieties, reduced emotional expression, low self-esteem, avoidance of intimacy, and depression are also reported. Many professionals have criticized the studies claiming that circumcision reduces HIV transmission. They have various flaws. The absolute rate of HIV transmission reduction is only 1.3%, not the claimed 60%. Authorities that cite the studies have other agendas including political and financial. Other methods to prevent HIV transmission (e.g., condoms and sterilizing medical instruments) are much more effective, much cheaper, and much less invasive.

Isn't ""get them before they can fight back"" the same technique the US

Isn't ""get them before they can fight back"" the same technique the US employs, with the same amount of protection provided against HIV? 93% of Ethiopian men are circumcised, and yet HIV rages there. Condoms are 97%-98% effective, when used regularly and correctly. The world has demonstrated that they are quite effective against the HIV virus. They are cheaper than a circumcision, and are much more effective. So one wonders why the WHO campaign and the Swazi medical establishment push circumcision, and not condoms? Condoms protect both partners.

Fake HIV kit not in UgandaPublish Date: Jan 11, 2012
Tweet
Share
By Francis Kagolo
The health ministry has said that Bioline, the rapid test kit for HIV/AIDS which has been blacklisted by the world health organization (WHO) for being ineffective, is not used in Uganda.
Bioline, which is manufactured in South Korea, was used by different countries as a confirmatory test, the second conducted during standard HIV testing, which uses three tests - an initial screening test, a confirmatory test and if there is a discrepancy, a third, tie-breaker test.
But WHO last month removed Bioline from its list of approved rapid test kits after it failed quality assurance tests.
At the time, over one million kits were in circulation in Kenya, about one-tenth of all the HIV kits available in the country then, according to official estimates by the Kenyan government.
The fake kits were also being used in Tanzania among other countries in the region. ""What we know so far is that 1,178 test kits have been used in the field, but we have yet to substantiate exactly how many of them were defective,"" Hadji Mponda, Tanzania's Health Minister, was quoted as saying at a news conference on last week.
Although the two governments have since recalled the condemned kits, there are fears the kits could still be in circulation in neighbouring countries.
However, the health ministry on Tuesday confirmed it had never approved Bioline test kits nor have they ever been imported into Uganda.
Dr. Zainab akol, the manager of the national HIV/AIDS control programme, said the ministry approved only three brands for testing HIV in Uganda.
The brands include Ditamine, Statpack, and Unigold. She said some other brands are used in HIV research and not in public health service provision.
“We are very tough when it comes to approving equipment used in testing and treating HIV/AIDS,” Akol stated. “The three brands we approved are accurate and can withstand our conditions including low refrigeration.”
Akol noted that centralizing the purchase and distribution of medical supplies under the national medical stores (NMS) had also helped to guard against importation of fake drugs and equipment.
She was, however, dismayed that Bioline, which initially was among the “most effective rapid testing kits”, could later turn out to be ineffective.
Moses Kamabale the NMS General Manager confirmed that Bioline is not used Uganda. Regina Ssali, in-charge Kiswa Health Centre, and a laboratory technician at Case Medicare, a private clinic prominent in HIV testing and treatment, also said they had never heard about the Bioline kits.

The world in mad rush for male circumcision but . . .
Posted Saturday, February 4 2012 at 00:00
In Summary
Getting the most of it. Now that three studies have shown that circumcising adult heterosexual men is one of the most effective “vaccines” against Aids—reducing the chances of infection by 60 per cent or more—public health experts are struggling to find ways to make the process faster, cheaper and safer.
Uganda marks its 50th anniversary as an independent country in 2012 but excessive celebrations could prove contentious or even divisive. The day of the assembly-line circumcision is drawing closer.
Now that three studies have shown that circumcising adult heterosexual men is one of the most effective “vaccines” against Aids—reducing the chances of infection by 60 per cent or more—public health experts are struggling to find ways to make the process faster, cheaper and safer.
The goal is to circumcise 20 million African men by 2015, but only about 600,000 have had the operation thus far. Even a skilled surgeon takes about 15 minutes, most African countries are desperately short of surgeons, and there is no Mohels Without Borders.
So donors are pinning their hopes on several devices now being tested to speed things up.
Dr Stefano Bertozzi, director of HIV for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said it had its eyes on two, named PrePex and the Shang Ring, and was supporting efforts by the World Health Organisation to evaluate them.
Circumcision is believed to protect heterosexual men because the foreskin has many Langerhans cells, which pick up viruses and “present” them to the immune system—which HIV attacks.

Par4TheCourseEach circumcision in South Africa cost about $108, said Dirk Taljaard of Progressus Research and Development Consultancy in Johannesburg, one of the study authors. He estimated that circumcising five men would prevent one new HIV infection in the next year and that every dollar spent on the procedure would save about $15 that would have later been spent on treatment.

ARGHHHH!!!
I can not begin to express my disgust, dismay, and downright anger over that one...#4.1 - Mon Jul 25, 2011 4:11 PM EDTcoalbear_1Strange that the only ""civilized"" countries that are pro-circers are the US and Israel.
Remember this article is given by the same doctor that said ritual circumcision was not effective and only clinical circumcision would work and was involved in the first studies that were stopped before results were in. Well, at $108 - $250 dollars a chop that's a pretty good cash-cow. By the numbers, the guy said 5 men circed for 1 saved per year. It would take 25 men circed for the same results for year two. Year 3 would be 650 men circumcised for every one saved. Good for the people getting the grants not for the population. Even if all African adult males were circumcised today (and its real-world effectiveness to stop HIV proves to be as high as purported in recent controlled studies),over the next 10-year period it would reduce the number of HIV cases in sub-SaharanAfrica by only eight percent, with a one percent reduction of deaths (Williams, 2006).
Free condoms at 0.03 cents apiece and not getting drunk and screwing prostitutes would be 95% more effective .(www.icgi.org)
Orange Farm(Farma) is a township located approximately 45 km from Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa. It is the largest informal settlement in South Africa, with most estimates giving a population of 1 million people (not 100,000 like the article suggests.)
Williams, B. G., Lloyd-Smith, J. O., Gouws, E., Hankins, C., & Getz, W. M. (2006). The potential impact of male circumcision on HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.

If a man wants to do it when he has all of the information (as in this case, before he is sexually active) - that is his right.
I don't think a parent has the right to make that decision for him.2 votes#4.3 - Mon Jul 25, 2011 5:11 PM EDTJimmy the GoonNothing is more sexy or healthy than a bunch of loose skin hanging over your penis to catch the pee when you sneeze and collect dirt.4 votes#5 - Mon Jul 25, 2011 4:27 PM EDTgrapeshot weRdoomed:
Do you also feel that parents should not inoculate infants against disease? Who are they to make such a choice for a helpless infant who doesn't understand all the facts? Shouldn't we wait until they are 18 and smart enough to decide for themselves? What about infant surgery?
I'm trying really hard to understand the anti circ crowd. Help me out with something besides you think its mutilation.2 votes#6 - Mon Jul 25, 2011 5:34 PM EDTweRdoomedIt is irreversible and not necessary. In my opinion, that is really all that needs to be said for the argument.
I do not believe that we should create any laws banning them in the USA or anything like that. But I feel strongly enough about it that I do voice my opinion when the topic comes up.
Do you also feel that parents should not inoculate infants against disease?
Circumcision is not capable of eradicating any diseases as immunizations have been able to do (this article even states that fact).
For this argument to work, you would need to equate it with cutting out the breast tissue of female babies to prevent breast cancer. Effective? Yes. A good idea? No. Though there are probably some who may argue it could be a good idea; I don't know.
What about infant surgery?
Infant surgery...I think it depends on the surgery. Circumcision is surgery so I would say 'no' in that case.
If the surgery is to save the child's life, I think the answer is obvious.1 vote#6.1 - Tue Jul 26, 2011 9:01 AM EDTkatrixCircumcision helps prevent disease and doesn't stop a man from having sex. Removing breast tissue would prevent a woman from feeding her babies and is not at all a good analogy.

Again, circumcision has health benefits without negatively impacting the function of the penis, whereas breast removal does negatively impact the function of the breast.
Disagree. With the removal of foreskin you remove millions of nerve-ending. Additionally, the head of the penis is no longer protected and becomes dry or calloused requiring artificial lubricant during intercourse in many circumstances.
Not to mention the risk of botched circumcisions.
http://www.fathermag.com/health/circ/horror/horror.shtml
This is a report from Richmond VA. Pediatric urologist Dr. Boyd Winslow reports having done over 1600 corrective surgeries for botched circumcisions in the past 3 years.
For a procedure that is unnecessary with limited health benefits (if any when in developed nations as the USA's primary HIV transmission comes from drug use, not intercourse).3 votes#6.6 - Wed Jul 27, 2011 9:06 AM EDTJimmy the GoonThere are no callouses on my penis. It is protected by this thing called underwear, and there is this thing called foreplay that if done right will provide enough natural lubricant to allow for normal intercourse.
Now as far as circumcision goes, the first 4 weeks of life is the BEST time to do the procedure. After that there are significantly more risks envolved. Your own article plainly states that. The Eurologists that was enterviewed is also the only Pediatric Eurologists in Richmond, VA and probably is one of the few in the state. He specialized in these kinds of repairs and probably gets cases from all over the state and neighboring states. So the 1600 number probably will hit under 1% when everything is said and done. Not a very convincing argument.
Now as far as all the broken heart stories about some idiot circumcising a kid who had a broken arm, that is just ludicrous. Of course it happens, there are idiots everywhere. One of the saddest is the case where the woman claims that the boy got infected on his second day of life and had to go back to the hospital where he recieved IV antibiotics. He had seizures that caused brain damage etc. While this is a sad story I suspect that the anti-biotics and not a circumcision caused the seizures. Anyway, it is plain that you are against circumcision regardless of the benefits and are looking for any excuse to make it wrong. 1 vote#6.7 - Wed Jul 27, 2011 10:34 AM EDTweRdoomed
Anyway, it is plain that you are against circumcision regardless of the benefits and are looking for any excuse to make it wrong.
Not at all, any man who wants to get one should. Frankly, my best lover ever was cut (sorry, hubby) as great love-making has nothing to do with whether you are cut or uncut.
I'm only against circumcising babies.
The reason there is an increased risk with older patients is because babies are healing machines and obligated to follow the ""no touching"" rule until healed.
It's not right to permanently alter a person's body without their consent - that is my ONLY problem with circumcision.
Men are so sensitive about their penises, I find they cannot rationally look at the concept of circumcision without automatically seeking to DEFEND their own penis -- if they are cut, they defend cutting. If they are uncut, the defend not cutting.
Objectively - I only argue that altering a person's body permanently and irreversibly without their consent and without PROFOUND benefit is unethical. And this would apply to any procedure that met this criteria.
But, kudos and appreciation all around for the penises attached to men who use them well - no matter their shape, size, color, or hairiness. ;-) Okay...now I'm just being too graphic...1 vote#6.8 - Wed Jul 27, 2011 10:47 AM EDTkatrixThat's not being too graphic, that's just being appreciative - and I second the thought!

Katrix I am confused. Should you trim, shave, or go native. To me that is more important that the whole circumcision issue.
As far as this story goes though, we are talking about Africa. Water is not always readily available and standards of cleanliness are not followed as well as they are here. I believe that in Africa circumcision has a much greater benefit to youg males than it does to those in the U.S.A. So my argument would be more geopgraphical. Sorry if I misjudged you weRdoomed.

Right, but this article also states, they do not know why there appears to be a benefit in the spread of HIV and circumcision.
Correlation does not equal causation (I learned that in 3rd grade!) and this study could still very well be debunked. At this point, the benefit appears to be from the ""lack of folds where HIV could hide"" and this same effect could then be found by giving all the African guys a bar of soap and telling them to wash their penises well!1 vote#8.2 - Wed Jul 27, 2011 10:48 AM EDTkatrixUnfortunately, many people in third world countries DIDN'T get to the third grade, and go more on superstition - which is why the whole raping the virgin to cure HIV idea is so rampant. While I agree with the circumcision idea, I also acknowledge that education and condoms can do even more to stop the spread of HIV.1 vote#8.3 - Wed Jul 27, 2011 11:30 AM EDTAuteur 1536Though thanks to the Pope condoms may not become so trendy in Africa.#8.4 - Wed Jul 27, 2011 5:06 PM EDTLeave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

Langerhans cells limit HIV invasion
Visit http://jcb.rupress.org/content/177/1/5a.full
Note published in The Journal of Cell Biology, Vol. 177, No. 1, 5 (March 2007), doi:10.1083/jcb.1771rr5, refers to de Witte* study in Nat. Med. doi:10.1038/nm1541. Further research shows that a suspected entry route for HIV is a dead end. Langerhans cells, rather than transmitting the virus to T cells, trap HIV-1 and thus act as a barrier to infection. The foreskin of the male penis has Langerhans cells, but they are removed, along with the foreskin, during circumcision.
Pro-circumcision advocates have long relied on the Langerhans cells as an entry point for HIV to justify the removal of the foreskin with its rich concentration of Langerhans cells. The basis for this thinking includes studies like the one published in The Journal of Immunology, 172: 2219-2224 in 2004, titled HIV-Infected Langerhans Cells Preferentially Transmit Virus to Proliferating Autologous CD4+ Memory T Cells Located within Langerhans Cell-T Cell Clusters.

Intactivism: Week in Review June 18, 2011
by Tally on June 18, 2011
Parents, protect your babies. Support intactivism. The following list includes blogs, articles, and websites of interest to Intactivists that were published in the past week. This is a running tally of the ones I found interesting.

Herald Sun Australia: Crowe snips circumcision tweets
""Circumcision is barbaric and stupid. Who are you to correct nature?"" Russell Crowe tweeted. Crowe reached out to his Jewish friends to reject circumcision and that is when the press had a field day, calling Crowe antisemitic. He removed many of the tweets because he did not want anyone to think he was mocking other's rituals and traditions.
End Routine Infant Circumcision: Why Circumcision Does NOT Slow The Spread of HIV
The average person should know that safe sex (condoms), monogamy, and knowing one’s HIV status are by far the most effective ways of slowing the spread of HIV. Although male circumcision is touted to reduce HIV, men must still wear a condom to protect themselves. Male circumcision gives a false sense of security, causing many to forego wearing a condom.

Life as a Reader: MGM (Infant Circumcision) and Parents' Rights
It is illegal to tattoo a person under the age of 18, and a parent can get in serious trouble for tattooing their young child. But we allow parents to cut off a part of a baby boy's penis. Parents have rights and responsibilities in their children's lives, but those rights are not without limits. Those limits need to be extended to the issue of male genital cutting (infant circumcision).
Male Circumcision and HIV: Intactivism, Anti-Semitism, and Foreskin Man
The problem with the Foreskin Man comic is an outsider, depicted as the Aryan looking hero, swooping into another community, depicted as Jewish, and shaping things their way. ""Outsiders imposing their will on a community is just bullshit. The change must come from within (joined by others) if it is to come at all. Matthew (Foreskin Man author) completely failed to understand this.""

International Journal of Epidemiology: Male circumcision and sexual function in men and women: a survey-based, cross-sectional study in Denmark
Study found that circumcision adversely impacts both men and women.
Background One-third of the world’s men are circumcised, but little is known about possible sexual consequences of male circumcision. In Denmark (∼5% circumcised), we examined associations of male circumcision with a range of sexual measures in both sexes.
Results . . . circumcised men reported more partners and were more likely to report frequent orgasm difficulties after adjustment for potential confounding factors, and women with circumcised spouses more often reported incomplete sexual needs fulfilment and frequent sexual function difficulties overall, notably orgasm difficulties and dyspareunia.
Conclusions Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.
Gurardian: Time to ban male circumcision?
The UK Guardian asks, ""isn't it time to oppose all circumcision?"" Finally, a mainstream media article that takes a sensible look at male genital cutting. It had to be one outside the US, though. The Guardian notes that the sexual damage caused by female and male genital cutting can be extensive. ""Both male and female genital cutting can have profound psychological consequences. Circumcised women often experience trauma, stress and anxiety, and can have relationship problems. Some circumcised men describe feelings of loss, anger, distrust, and grief, while others have reported problems with subsequent intimacy, long-term post-traumatic stress disorder, and a sense of powerlessness.""
Beyond the Bris: On Circumcision, Authority and the Perpetuation of Abuse
A Jewish man describes his botched circumcision. His erections are tight and painful because too much skin was removed during his infant circumcision. He believes male infant circumcision is barbaric and needs to stop. He is working as an intactivist and has a news site.
DanNation.org: The SF Circumcision Law: Nathan Exposed On Foreskin Exposed (NSFW)
Nathan Exposed writes about the proposed circumcision ban in San Francisco. The circumcision ban gives the rights to the male whose penis is subject to circumcision. It is the male who has the right to a whole body. There is no parental right to cut off part of their baby's sex organ. He tells those that do not like foreskins to not sleep with an intact man.

HolyPost: Jackson Doughart: Are opponents of circumcision anti-Semitic?
I agree with the author that the notion that intactivism is intrinsically anti-Semitic is ridiculous. If anything, the movement has generally avoided criticizing the religious justifications for circumcision and has instead focused on eliminating cultural circumcision.He makes the point that the many who practice and believe in removing a part of the healthy sex organ of a child could be considered perverse and not, as many suggest, those who fight to leave the sex organs of babys alone.
Nathan Exposed: Nathan Exposed Featured in Circumcision Ban Article
Nathan authored a guest post in DanNation about why he supports the male infant circumcision ban in San Francisco.
Should I Circumcise?: Is Intactivism antisemitic?
The answer is . . . NO! ""There is nothing inherently antisemitic about wanting to save innocent babies from having part of their penis chopped off."" The author is a circumcised man who discusses how circumcision impacts those who realize what they lost from having part of their sex organ removed at birth. He feels anger toward the doctors that cut him. He can relate to a person feeling anger toward a mohel, but that is not antisemitism. It is anger directed to a perpetrator of a genital cutting.
Intactivists Blog: In Response to All Fooked Up
A post about another blogger who had her son circumcised because she thought he would never get a blowjob if he was not circumcised. Such a foolish woman. She judges her son's (and all other men's) penis and they are not good enough for her. They need to be surgically altered to meet her definition of being ""blog job worthy."" I bet her son, when he grows up and reads his mother's blog, will end up wishing she had left him whole and intact. Many young men today feel that way after they learn of the harm caused them by circumcision.
IAIN HALL's Sandpit: Intact genitals are a human right
Circumcision of male infants is tantamount to the most cruel child abuse. It is an unnecessary mutilation of a most vulnerable person, often done without anaesthetic.
Dr. Akilah El: Male Circumcision Originally Created To Prevent Masturbation
A brief history of circumcision, which was promoted in America in the 1800's as a way to curb the sexual appetite. Many say that circumcision does not affect masturbation because they think they still masturbate a lot. Most circumcised men have no basis of comparison and their statement that circumcision has not affected their masturbation is unsupported. After I started restoring my foreskin, I noticed that I masturbate more often, even while having a satisfactory sex life. Having a foreskin makes masturbation very easy. I do not need to use lube like I used to. The gliding action of the foreskin stimulates me in a way that I never could without a foreskin. I have whole body orgasms when masturbating with my restored foreskin. I never had them before I started restoring. Male circumcision really does impact masturbation.

The Jewish Chronicle Online: Circumcision critic has Board links
Jewish Journal: Circumcision critic has Board links
A Jewish woman who called for circumcision to be banned is an associate of the Board of Deputies for New West End Synagogue. Time to ban male circumcision? said: “Men, too, can be victims of unjust hegemonic systems tolerated in the name of tradition, culture or religion. If we oppose female genital mutilation, has the time not come for us also to oppose male genital mutilation?”
Joseph4GI: Jewish LGBT Leaders Against SF Circ Ban - Ignorance or Hypocrisy?
A critique of the recent news that Jewish LGBT (gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transgendered) leaders are speaking out against the restriction on underage circumcision in San Francisco. Joseph points out how their viewpoint is oftentimes inconsistent and contradictory. For example, ""how far does the Jewish LGBT community support a 'parent's right' and 'religious freedom'? Would they support a parent's 'right' to submit their son to electro-shock therapy to make him 'straight'? After all, it says so in the Torah that gays are an abomination to 'g-d,' and that they should be stoned to death.""

Male Circumcision and HIV: DENMARK: Circumcision associated with sexual dysfunction in men and women
A report of the recently published Danish study that shows male circumcision increases sexual dysfunction in both men and women. ""Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.""
Examiner: New study: male circumcision and sexual difficulties for men and female partners
A European study of the sexual side-effects from circumcision revealed a surprising number of conditions and ailments associated with circumcision. In addition to complications, there is now data that shows male circumcision is associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women who have sex with circumcised men.
Viceland: Matthew Hess wants to save your baby's foreskin
An interview with Matthew Hess, the man behind the Foreskin Man comic book. Hess provides good information regarding his motivation behind the Foreskin Man graphic novels. He is not antisemitic, but only wanted to show how the circumcisers would appear to a young child who is having a healthy part of his body cut off. Hess also discusses the ill effects of circumcision and foreskin restoration to undo some of the damage caused by male circumcision.

Life as a Reader: Sexual Dysfunction and MGM (Circumcision)
A recent Danish study found that male circumcision has adverse effects for men by reducing their sexual pleasure. The blogger asks why is there no study in the United States on how male circumcision affects sexual pleasure. Since the medical industry promotes male circumcision, they should have studies showing how great male circumcision is. But there are no such studies. Hmm. Maybe because the medical industry realizes that male circumcision often results in sexual dysfunction and they do not want to lose their cash cow.

Treatment of Pain in the Older Patient
Therapeutics Letter Issue 33 / Jan - Feb 2000
Printer Version
File Downloads
Newsletter #33
The assessment of gabapentin (Neurontin) included in this Letter was based on potentially misleading information, as reported by the manufacturer. U.S. litigation in 2009-2010 has revealed that Neurontin’s off-label promotion, which over a relatively short period led to blockbuster status for this drug with multi-billion dollars in annual sales world-wide, was assisted by selective publication and citation of studies with favorable outcomes. Court-ordered access to unpublished studies allowed us to present a more accurate estimate of gabapentin’s clinical effects in Therapeutics Letter #75 (July-December 2009)
Providing effective analgesia to a patient may seem routine, yet it is one of medicine’s most satisfying achievements. Serious pain eventually afflicts virtually everyone, and is particularly prevalent in the elderly. Currently available analgesics control acute pain promptly and safely in the vast majority of patients. Unfortunately chronic pain typically presents a much more difficult challenge. In a recent systematic review, the prevalence of pain in older people ranged from 62 to 83%, the most common type being musculoskeletal.1
This Letter focuses on the evidence and principles for drug therapy of chronic non-malignant pain in the older person.
What evidence is available about pain treatment in the elderly?
Surprisingly few clinical trials provide guidance on how best to treat pain in older people.1 Recent Clinical Practice Guidelines2,3 are substantially opinion-based. They reiterate the familiar adage, ""start low and go slow"", and also support use of opioids in the elderly for both malignant and non-malignant pain. These guidelines also suggest that a combination of drugs at low dose may be safer than increasing the dose of a single agent. However they offer no controlled trial data to support this approach, and it is possible that interactions between multiple drugs at low dose may be more dangerous than higher doses of a single drug.
Interpreting clinical trials of analgesics is especially difficult because side effects often compromise blinding. For example, a patient may interpret sedation as pain relief, without appreciating the risks of impairment as regards driving, falls, or mental function.
Older trials, while often of poor quality, tended to report more useful clinical endpoints, such as ‘patient improved or did not’. More recent trials report average pain scores, which don’t allow calculation of what proportion of patients have clinically significant pain relief.
What if there is limited evidence from controlled trials?
Insufficient evidence about a drug is less critical in managing pain and other symptoms than when prescribing preventive therapy. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence tells us that for most analgesics, only a minority of patients with chronic pain will respond. It is therefore up to the physician to establish that the therapy is in fact helping each individual patient. This can be achieved with a short therapeutic trial (usually 2 weeks). If the patient’s pain or suffering are not substantially reduced, or if the side effects outweigh the benefit, then the therapy should be stopped. Even when the therapy is judged to be helpful, it is still necessary to reassess efficacy at regular intervals (say every 3 to 6 months) by stopping it altogether. Ultimately improvement in function is the real goal of therapy.
Most long-term therapies have some risks (such as falls with tricyclic and SSRI antidepressants, or GI hemorrhage with NSAIDs), and as a consequence, practitioners must continually balance the symptomatic and functional benefit against these risks.
The fact remains that long-term RCTs are needed in the elderly to measure serious adverse outcomes and provide physicians with better tools to calculate the benefit-harm ratio in individual patients.
Do older persons respond differently to drugs?
Normal aging and associated organ dysfunction tend to increase sensitivity to both desirable and adverse effects of most drugs. Reduced renal function (even with ""normal"" serum creatinine), altered volume of distribution and a range of other factors all potentially increase elimination half-life and drug effect for many drugs. These features support the ""start low and go slow"" approach.
What is known about specific drugs for chronic pain?
We have reviewed the published literature on selected drugs, using standard search techniques to identify reports of double-blind RCTs. When choosing drugs for a therapeutic trial in chronic pain, it may be useful to classify patients as having either non-neuropathic or neuropathic pain.
NON-NEUROPATHIC PAIN
A) ""Muscle relaxants""
Methocarbamol (Robaxin®) including various formulations combined with acetaminophen, ASA, and codeine (e.g. Robaxacet-8®, Robaxisal-C®) have been available for decades. However we could find no well-controlled blinded studies that establish its efficacy. Methocarbamol has a short elimination half-life (2 hrs) and has significant side effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea in 4-5% of patients. The drug’s popularity may be due to its sedative effect, or more likely to the effect of the other ingredients in combination tablets. Generic acetaminophen+/-codeine affords a less expensive and safer choice. (see Table)
Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril®) like other tricyclics, has a complex route of metabolism. Elimination half-life is 1-3 days, and hence it can be given as a single bedtime dose. It has significant potential for many drug interactions, however, and side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth and dizziness are common. Constipation, urinary retention, delirium or dysrhythmias may occur, particularly in older patients. The manufacturer does not recommend use of cyclobenzaprine for periods longer than 2 to 3 weeks. Only one RCT of reasonable size and duration has examined efficacy.4 This was a Canadian study of 208 patients with fibromyalgia, which compared cyclobenzaprine (10-30 mg/d) with amitriptyline (10-50 mg/d) or placebo. At 1 month, 12% of cyclobenzaprine-treated patients and 21% of those taking amitriptyline showed improvement as compared with placebo. Most patients experienced side effects, and at 6 months neither drug provided any significant benefit.
Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, etc.) are not analgesics and can potentiate the sedative side effects of other analgesics. Because of their potential to induce dependence, they are not indicated for chronic pain.
B) Antidepressants
Tricyclics such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and their metabolites nortriptyline and desipramine are widely used in chronic pain. They share anticholinergic side effects (constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, delirium), sedation, weight gain and a propensity to fall. Average elimination half-live is long (1 day) and is greatly prolonged in genetically poor metabolizers (about 5% of people), in whom accumulation can occur well past one week at any dose.
For chronic back pain, a 1997 systematic review found no evidence that antidepressants are superior to placebo.5 For other conditions, the evidence is mixed. In 41 patients with chronic non-malignant pain, amitriptyline at 25 mg/d was better than placebo within the first week.6
Overall, the published trials suggest that a minority of non-depressed patients with chronic pain attain a modest benefit.7 This benefit must be weighed against the side effects listed above.8 Evening dosing may improve the benefit-harm ratio for sedation. There is little evidence to support large doses. If pain is not clearly improved within a week at a low dose, titrate by doubling the dose. A considered decision either to stop or to continue a tricyclic should be made within the first month of therapy.
SSRIs. Clinical trials in headache, neuropathy, and fibromyalgia have produced conflicting results but on balance the trial data is not convincing that SSRI’s are useful for analgesia.
C) Acetaminophen, NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors
Acetaminophen remains the analgesic of first choice for mild to moderate non-neuropathic pain. No conventional NSAID has proved better than any other in managing the pain of osteoarthritis (see Letter #4). Cox-2 inhibitors will be the subjects of a Letter later this year.
D) Glucosamine
At present there is no conclusive RCT evidence that glucosamine is effective in osteoarthritis.9
E) Methotrimeprazine (Nozinan®)
The only phenothiazine with analgesic properties, methotrimeprazine also has prominent sedative, anticholinergic, and hypotensive effects. These adverse effects may be tolerable in the short term, but likely outweigh its advantages in most long-term therapy. Like other phenothiazines it has a long half-life and a risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, including tardive dyskinesia.
F) Opioids
Sir William Osler presumably drew on clinical experience when he acclaimed morphine as ""God’s own medicine"". Even so, there is surprisingly little evidence from controlled trials to guide the use of opioids for chronic non-malignant pain.2 Standard recommendations favouring codeine/morphine over alternative opioids are not evidence-based. At higher cost, controlled-release formulations offer convenience of dosing and more consistent analgesia. Experience suggests that constipation can be addressed with diet, improved mobility, and laxatives, although controlled trials in this area are non-existent. Oral anileridine (Leritine®) and transcutaneous fentanyl (both analogs of meperidine) are occasionally useful in morphine-intolerant patients. Meperidine (Demerol®) has poor oral bio-availability and a short half-life. Normeperidine, a metabolite of both meperidine and anileridine, has a much longer elimination half-life than the parent drugs, and may also cause life-threatening convulsions, especially during chronic high dose therapy, or in patients with renal insufficiency associated with aging. Morphine and congeners are therefore preferable.
Patient and prescriber misconceptions about the ""addictive potential"" may result in under-use of opioids for chronic pain in the elderly. It is true that continuous chronic use is likely to induce pharmacologic tolerance and dependence, but is however unlikely to cause the destructive pattern of behaviour termed ""addiction"". As in the control of cancer pain, a decision to employ opioids should weigh the potential benefits of analgesia and improved function against the well-known side effects of constipation, nausea, sedation, and mental clouding. Concomitant use of anticholinergic and CNS-depressant drugs (including antispasmodics, antihistamines, tricyclics, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics) should be minimized. As with other drugs, opioid therapy should be continued only if symptoms and/or function clearly improve during a therapeutic trial.
NEUROPATHIC PAIN
A) Antidepressants
Amitriptyline and desipramine were associated in a small trial with moderate or better pain relief in 74% and 61% of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy as compared with 41% of patients on placebo. Fluoxetine was similar to placebo.10 The number needed to treat (NNT) for amitriptyline and desipramine is 3 and 5, respectively.
B) Anticonvulsants
Carbamazepine, although widely used for chronic neuropathic pain, has limited RCT evidence for efficacy. Combining 3 placebo-controlled trials in trigeminal neuralgia yields a 2-week NNT of 2.6 for benefit, and a NNH of 3.4 for adverse effects (mainly drowsiness, dizziness and gait disturbance) over two weeks. Doses were mostly 400-1000 mg/day. A 30-person cross-over trial with carbamazepine in diabetic neuropathy suggests a modest benefit within 2 weeks at doses 600 mg/day or less.11 Carbamazepine risks many interactions and toxicities of particular significance in the elderly (sedation, ataxia, hyponatremia, leukopenia). Its elimination half-life is about 12 hours. If improvement is not obvious within 2 weeks, the drug should be discontinued to avoid toxicity.
The assessment of gabapentin (Neurontin) included in this Letter was based on potentially misleading information, as reported by the manufacturer. U.S. litigation in 2009-2010 has revealed that Neurontin’s off-label promotion, which over a relatively short period led to blockbuster status for this drug with multi-billion dollars in annual sales world-wide, was assisted by selective publication and citation of studies with favorable outcomes. Court-ordered access to unpublished studies allowed us to present a more accurate estimate of gabapentin’s clinical effects in Therapeutics Letter #75 (July-December 2009)
Gabapentin (Neurontin®) is an anticonvulsant of unknown mechanism, excreted unmetabolized by the kidney. The average 6-hour elimination half-life measured in young volunteers is prolonged in older people with diminished renal function. Although gabapentin has been widely employed in various types of chronic pain, little evidence from high-quality controlled trials is available. A recent 8-week double blind RCT (N=165) compared gabapentin with placebo in otherwise uncomplicated patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.12 At 1,800 mg/d, a small benefit (1 point decrease on an 11 point pain score) was noted within 2 weeks. Benefit did not increase at higher doses, nor with longer therapy. The chance that a patient could discern a ""moderate or marked"" benefit attributable to gabapentin in an overall self-rating was 27% (NNT=4). The statistical validity of this number is questionable, and adverse effects such as dizziness (ARI=19%, NNH=5) and somnolence (ARI=16%, NNH=6) were frequent.
A similar 8-week RCT (N=229) in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia found a slightly larger average change in score (2/11 points) favouring gabapentin.13 Again, the benefit was seen by 2 weeks at 1,800 mg/d. Somnolence (ARI=22%, NNH=5), dizziness (ARI=19%, NNH=5), and ataxia (ARI=7%, NNH=14) were common.
A small crossover RCT (N=19) compared gabapentin (900- 1,800 mg/d) with amitriptyline (25-75 mg/d) for diabetic neuropathy. Amitriptyline provided ""moderate, a lot, or complete"" pain relief in 67% of patients, vs. 52% of those on gabapentin (P < 0.01). Virtually all patients experienced adverse effects with each drug.14 Gabapentin benefits at best a minority of patients with painful diabetic or post-herpetic neuropathy. Toxicity, but not analgesia, is dose-dependent. Stop the drug if pain relief does not clearly outweigh harm by 2 weeks.
C) Local anaesthetics
Mexilitine (Mexitil®) is an anti-dysrhythmic drug structurally related to lidocaine, with similar CNS, GI, and cardiovascular adverse effects. It is metabolized by the liver, with an average elimination half-life of 10 hours in healthy volunteers. The potential for dangerous drug interactions is significant, and mexilitine increased mortality in early trials of dysrhythmia suppression after MI. Although it has been used in painful diabetic and other neuropathies since 1988, we could find no double blind RCT of adequate quality to demonstrate an unequivocal benefit. Many small trials have serious design flaws. Such studies generally exclude patients with CHF, renal failure, abnormal EKG, or concomitant beta-blocker use, so that reported adverse event rates are undoubtedly lower than might be expected in typical elderly patients.15

Conclusions:
Chronic pain, particularly of musculo-skeletal origin, is a common problem for the elderly.
Long-term controlled trials in older people with chronic pain are lacking and are needed to guide rational therapy.
Physiological changes that occur with aging make older individuals more sensitive to the effects of drugs.
Most analgesic drugs provide modest benefit to only a minority of patients.
Start with low doses and titrate; symptomatic and functional benefits are evident early (usually within 1-2 weeks).
Benefit of each analgesic must be established by a therapeutic trial and reassessed regularly.
Overall goal of analgesic therapy is improved function and quality of life.

Antidepressants and Back Pain
Filed under: Pain,Uncategorized — Rick Heller @ 11:47 am
Antidepressants for non-specific low back pain
There is no clear evidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the management of patients with chronic low-back pain. These findings do not imply that severely depressed patients with back pain should not be treated with antidepressants; furthermore, there is evidence for their use in other forms of chronic pain.

Misuse of pain patch
Filed under: Neuroscience,Pain,Uncategorized — Rick Heller @ 1:41 pm
US issues new warning on misuse of J&J pain patch | Reuters
Despite a July 2005 warning, the Food and Drug Administration “has continued to receive reports of deaths and life-threatening side effects after doctors have inappropriately prescribed the patch or patients have incorrectly used it,” the agency said.
The patch delivers a potent narcotic called fentanyl through the skin. The product was approved in 1990 for patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe pain and whose bodies are used to opioids. That means they have used another strong opioid pain medicine around the clock for a week or longer.

Chili peppers shows promise in local anesthesia
Filed under: Pain — Rick Heller @ 10:23 am
Pain gate guru Clifford Woolf et al have come up with a method of selective local anesthesia working back from theoretical knowledge of the pain system.
The work on lab rats, described in the scientific journal Nature, breaks from the standard approach to local anesthesia, which usually involves anesthetics delivered by IV tubes or injections that silence all neurons in a given region of the body, not just those that sense pain. Shutting down just the pain neurons means that patients could still feel a light touch and other nonhurtful sensations.
“This could really change the experience of, for example, knee surgery, tooth extractions, or childbirth,” said Dr. Clifford Woolf, senior author of the study and a researcher in anesthesia and pain management at Mass. General. “The possibilities are almost endless.”

DEA After Pain Docs

The Phoenix has a piece by Harvery Silvergate on the DEA’s prosecution of pain doctors.
I do think that some doctors mistakenly favor a pharamcological approach over one that includes talk therapy, but I don’t think they should be prosecuted for that.

Doctors suppress response to patients' pain
Filed under: Pain — Rick Heller @ 10:53 am
Doctors learn to distance themselves from their patient’s pain.
Doctors learn to shut down the part of the brain that empathises with the pain their patients suffer during treatment, so they can avoid becoming distressed by conducting unpleasant medical procedures. Brain scans have revealed that doctors show a different pattern of neural activity to other people when watching videos of painful therapies.

Hypnosis + pain research
Filed under: Pain — Rick Heller @ 11:06 pm
Excellent resource on Hypnosis + pain research, including references to studies of hypnotically-induced pain, which in an fMRI activates similar regions to pain induced physically.
However, when subjects who have not been hypnotized are asked to imagine feeling pain, it’s much less intense than what is experienced under hypnotic suggestion.

Acupuncture, real or sham, reduces back pain
Filed under: Pain — Rick Heller @ 1:13 pm
Report on a study of treating back pain with acupuncture
In trials among 1,100 patients with chronic lower back pain which had lasted for an average of eight years, almost half (47 per cent) of those who received acupuncture showed significant improvement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ compared with barely a quarter (27 per cent) of those given conventional treatment. The effects lasted for at least six months, long after the treatment was completed.
The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Regensberg, in the spa town of Bad Abbach in Germany, who randomly allocated patients to receive ten 30-minute sessions of sham acupuncture, real acupuncture or conventional treatment.
Sham acupuncture involved sticking needles in randomly over the lower back, avoiding the meridians and points that dictate where the needles are placed in traditional acupuncture.
The results showed that 44 per cent of volunteers suffering from back pain showed a significant improvement with sham acupuncture.
1. The study suggests that the philosophy of acupuncture, the meridians, etc, is bogus. It’s about sticking needles into the skin.
2. The gate control theory of pain sensations shows that counter-stimulation can reduce pain by tricking the pain gates in the spine. This is the principal used in transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Tens).
In addition, there is probably a psychological component. Acupuncture, because of its bizarre appearance, may well have an impressive placebo effect. Placebo pain relief is real, and releases opioids in the brain.

Newsletter #33 [1]
The assessment of gabapentin (Neurontin) included in this Letter was based on potentially misleading information, as reported by the manufacturer. U.S. litigation in 2009-2010 has revealed that Neurontin’s off-label promotion, which over a relatively short period led to blockbuster status for this drug with multi-billion dollars in annual sales world-wide, was assisted by selective publication and citation of studies with favorable outcomes. Court-ordered access to unpublished studies allowed us to present a more accurate estimate of gabapentin’s clinical effects in Therapeutics Letter #75 (July-December 2009)
Providing effective analgesia to a patient may seem routine, yet it is one of medicine’s most satisfying achievements. Serious pain eventually afflicts virtually everyone, and is particularly prevalent in the elderly. Currently available analgesics control acute pain promptly and safely in the vast majority of patients. Unfortunately chronic pain typically presents a much more difficult challenge. In a recent systematic review, the prevalence of pain in older people ranged from 62 to 83%, the most common type being musculoskeletal.1
This Letter focuses on the evidence and principles for drug therapy of chronic non-malignant pain in the older person.
What evidence is available about pain treatment in the elderly?
Surprisingly few clinical trials provide guidance on how best to treat pain in older people.1 Recent Clinical Practice Guidelines2,3 are substantially opinion-based. They reiterate the familiar adage, ""start low and go slow"", and also support use of opioids in the elderly for both malignant and non-malignant pain. These guidelines also suggest that a combination of drugs at low dose may be safer than increasing the dose of a single agent. However they offer no controlled trial data to support this approach, and it is possible that interactions between multiple drugs at low dose may be more dangerous than higher doses of a single drug.
Interpreting clinical trials of analgesics is especially difficult because side effects often compromise blinding. For example, a patient may interpret sedation as pain relief, without appreciating the risks of impairment as regards driving, falls, or mental function.
Older trials, while often of poor quality, tended to report more useful clinical endpoints, such as ‘patient improved or did not’. More recent trials report average pain scores, which don’t allow calculation of what proportion of patients have clinically significant pain relief.
What if there is limited evidence from controlled trials?
Insufficient evidence about a drug is less critical in managing pain and other symptoms than when prescribing preventive therapy. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence tells us that for most analgesics, only a minority of patients with chronic pain will respond. It is therefore up to the physician to establish that the therapy is in fact helping each individual patient. This can be achieved with a short therapeutic trial (usually 2 weeks). If the patient’s pain or suffering are not substantially reduced, or if the side effects outweigh the benefit, then the therapy should be stopped. Even when the therapy is judged to be helpful, it is still necessary to reassess efficacy at regular intervals (say every 3 to 6 months) by stopping it altogether. Ultimately improvement in function is the real goal of therapy.
Most long-term therapies have some risks (such as falls with tricyclic and SSRI antidepressants, or GI hemorrhage with NSAIDs), and as a consequence, practitioners must continually balance the symptomatic and functional benefit against these risks.
The fact remains that long-term RCTs are needed in the elderly to measure serious adverse outcomes and provide physicians with better tools to calculate the benefit-harm ratio in individual patients.
Do older persons respond differently to drugs?
Normal aging and associated organ dysfunction tend to increase sensitivity to both desirable and adverse effects of most drugs. Reduced renal function (even with ""normal"" serum creatinine), altered volume of distribution and a range of other factors all potentially increase elimination half-life and drug effect for many drugs. These features support the ""start low and go slow"" approach.
What is known about specific drugs for chronic pain?
We have reviewed the published literature on selected drugs, using standard search techniques to identify reports of double-blind RCTs. When choosing drugs for a therapeutic trial in chronic pain, it may be useful to classify patients as having either non-neuropathic or neuropathic pain.
NON-NEUROPATHIC PAIN
A) ""Muscle relaxants""
Methocarbamol (Robaxin®) including various formulations combined with acetaminophen, ASA, and codeine (e.g. Robaxacet-8®, Robaxisal-C®) have been available for decades. However we could find no well-controlled blinded studies that establish its efficacy. Methocarbamol has a short elimination half-life (2 hrs) and has significant side effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea in 4-5% of patients. The drug’s popularity may be due to its sedative effect, or more likely to the effect of the other ingredients in combination tablets. Generic acetaminophen+/-codeine affords a less expensive and safer choice. (see Table)
Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril®) like other tricyclics, has a complex route of metabolism. Elimination half-life is 1-3 days, and hence it can be given as a single bedtime dose. It has significant potential for many drug interactions, however, and side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth and dizziness are common. Constipation, urinary retention, delirium or dysrhythmias may occur, particularly in older patients. The manufacturer does not recommend use of cyclobenzaprine for periods longer than 2 to 3 weeks. Only one RCT of reasonable size and duration has examined efficacy.4 This was a Canadian study of 208 patients with fibromyalgia, which compared cyclobenzaprine (10-30 mg/d) with amitriptyline (10-50 mg/d) or placebo. At 1 month, 12% of cyclobenzaprine-treated patients and 21% of those taking amitriptyline showed improvement as compared with placebo. Most patients experienced side effects, and at 6 months neither drug provided any significant benefit.
Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, etc.) are not analgesics and can potentiate the sedative side effects of other analgesics. Because of their potential to induce dependence, they are not indicated for chronic pain.
B) Antidepressants
Tricyclics such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and their metabolites nortriptyline and desipramine are widely used in chronic pain. They share anticholinergic side effects (constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, delirium), sedation, weight gain and a propensity to fall. Average elimination half-live is long (1 day) and is greatly prolonged in genetically poor metabolizers (about 5% of people), in whom accumulation can occur well past one week at any dose.
For chronic back pain, a 1997 systematic review found no evidence that antidepressants are superior to placebo.5 For other conditions, the evidence is mixed. In 41 patients with chronic non-malignant pain, amitriptyline at 25 mg/d was better than placebo within the first week.6
Overall, the published trials suggest that a minority of non-depressed patients with chronic pain attain a modest benefit.7 This benefit must be weighed against the side effects listed above.8 Evening dosing may improve the benefit-harm ratio for sedation. There is little evidence to support large doses. If pain is not clearly improved within a week at a low dose, titrate by doubling the dose. A considered decision either to stop or to continue a tricyclic should be made within the first month of therapy.
SSRIs. Clinical trials in headache, neuropathy, and fibromyalgia have produced conflicting results but on balance the trial data is not convincing that SSRI’s are useful for analgesia.
C) Acetaminophen, NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors
Acetaminophen remains the analgesic of first choice for mild to moderate non-neuropathic pain. No conventional NSAID has proved better than any other in managing the pain of osteoarthritis (see Letter #4 [2]). Cox-2 inhibitors will be the subjects of a Letter later this year.
D) Glucosamine
At present there is no conclusive RCT evidence that glucosamine is effective in osteoarthritis.9
E) Methotrimeprazine (Nozinan®)
The only phenothiazine with analgesic properties, methotrimeprazine also has prominent sedative, anticholinergic, and hypotensive effects. These adverse effects may be tolerable in the short term, but likely outweigh its advantages in most long-term therapy. Like other phenothiazines it has a long half-life and a risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, including tardive dyskinesia.
F) Opioids
Sir William Osler presumably drew on clinical experience when he acclaimed morphine as ""God’s own medicine"". Even so, there is surprisingly little evidence from controlled trials to guide the use of opioids for chronic non-malignant pain.2 Standard recommendations favouring codeine/morphine over alternative opioids are not evidence-based. At higher cost, controlled-release formulations offer convenience of dosing and more consistent analgesia. Experience suggests that constipation can be addressed with diet, improved mobility, and laxatives, although controlled trials in this area are non-existent. Oral anileridine (Leritine®) and transcutaneous fentanyl (both analogs of meperidine) are occasionally useful in morphine-intolerant patients. Meperidine (Demerol®) has poor oral bio-availability and a short half-life. Normeperidine, a metabolite of both meperidine and anileridine, has a much longer elimination half-life than the parent drugs, and may also cause life-threatening convulsions, especially during chronic high dose therapy, or in patients with renal insufficiency associated with aging. Morphine and congeners are therefore preferable.
Patient and prescriber misconceptions about the ""addictive potential"" may result in under-use of opioids for chronic pain in the elderly. It is true that continuous chronic use is likely to induce pharmacologic tolerance and dependence, but is however unlikely to cause the destructive pattern of behaviour termed ""addiction"". As in the control of cancer pain, a decision to employ opioids should weigh the potential benefits of analgesia and improved function against the well-known side effects of constipation, nausea, sedation, and mental clouding. Concomitant use of anticholinergic and CNS-depressant drugs (including antispasmodics, antihistamines, tricyclics, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics) should be minimized. As with other drugs, opioid therapy should be continued only if symptoms and/or function clearly improve during a therapeutic trial.
NEUROPATHIC PAIN
A) Antidepressants
Amitriptyline and desipramine were associated in a small trial with moderate or better pain relief in 74% and 61% of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy as compared with 41% of patients on placebo. Fluoxetine was similar to placebo.10 The number needed to treat (NNT) for amitriptyline and desipramine is 3 and 5, respectively.
B) Anticonvulsants
Carbamazepine, although widely used for chronic neuropathic pain, has limited RCT evidence for efficacy. Combining 3 placebo-controlled trials in trigeminal neuralgia yields a 2-week NNT of 2.6 for benefit, and a NNH of 3.4 for adverse effects (mainly drowsiness, dizziness and gait disturbance) over two weeks. Doses were mostly 400-1000 mg/day. A 30-person cross-over trial with carbamazepine in diabetic neuropathy suggests a modest benefit within 2 weeks at doses 600 mg/day or less.11 Carbamazepine risks many interactions and toxicities of particular significance in the elderly (sedation, ataxia, hyponatremia, leukopenia). Its elimination half-life is about 12 hours. If improvement is not obvious within 2 weeks, the drug should be discontinued to avoid toxicity.
The assessment of gabapentin (Neurontin) included in this Letter was based on potentially misleading information, as reported by the manufacturer. U.S. litigation in 2009-2010 has revealed that Neurontin’s off-label promotion, which over a relatively short period led to blockbuster status for this drug with multi-billion dollars in annual sales world-wide, was assisted by selective publication and citation of studies with favorable outcomes. Court-ordered access to unpublished studies allowed us to present a more accurate estimate of gabapentin’s clinical effects in Therapeutics Letter #75 [3] (July-December 2009)
Gabapentin (Neurontin®) is an anticonvulsant of unknown mechanism, excreted unmetabolized by the kidney. The average 6-hour elimination half-life measured in young volunteers is prolonged in older people with diminished renal function. Although gabapentin has been widely employed in various types of chronic pain, little evidence from high-quality controlled trials is available. A recent 8-week double blind RCT (N=165) compared gabapentin with placebo in otherwise uncomplicated patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.12 At 1,800 mg/d, a small benefit (1 point decrease on an 11 point pain score) was noted within 2 weeks. Benefit did not increase at higher doses, nor with longer therapy. The chance that a patient could discern a ""moderate or marked"" benefit attributable to gabapentin in an overall self-rating was 27% (NNT=4). The statistical validity of this number is questionable, and adverse effects such as dizziness (ARI=19%, NNH=5) and somnolence (ARI=16%, NNH=6) were frequent.
A similar 8-week RCT (N=229) in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia found a slightly larger average change in score (2/11 points) favouring gabapentin.13 Again, the benefit was seen by 2 weeks at 1,800 mg/d. Somnolence (ARI=22%, NNH=5), dizziness (ARI=19%, NNH=5), and ataxia (ARI=7%, NNH=14) were common.
A small crossover RCT (N=19) compared gabapentin (900- 1,800 mg/d) with amitriptyline (25-75 mg/d) for diabetic neuropathy. Amitriptyline provided ""moderate, a lot, or complete"" pain relief in 67% of patients, vs. 52% of those on gabapentin (P < 0.01). Virtually all patients experienced adverse effects with each drug.14 Gabapentin benefits at best a minority of patients with painful diabetic or post-herpetic neuropathy. Toxicity, but not analgesia, is dose-dependent. Stop the drug if pain relief does not clearly outweigh harm by 2 weeks.
C) Local anaesthetics
Mexilitine (Mexitil®) is an anti-dysrhythmic drug structurally related to lidocaine, with similar CNS, GI, and cardiovascular adverse effects. It is metabolized by the liver, with an average elimination half-life of 10 hours in healthy volunteers. The potential for dangerous drug interactions is significant, and mexilitine increased mortality in early trials of dysrhythmia suppression after MI. Although it has been used in painful diabetic and other neuropathies since 1988, we could find no double blind RCT of adequate quality to demonstrate an unequivocal benefit. Many small trials have serious design flaws. Such studies generally exclude patients with CHF, renal failure, abnormal EKG, or concomitant beta-blocker use, so that reported adverse event rates are undoubtedly lower than might be expected in typical elderly patients.15

Conclusions:
Chronic pain, particularly of musculo-skeletal origin, is a common problem for the elderly.
Long-term controlled trials in older people with chronic pain are lacking and are needed to guide rational therapy.
Physiological changes that occur with aging make older individuals more sensitive to the effects of drugs.
Most analgesic drugs provide modest benefit to only a minority of patients.
Start with low doses and titrate; symptomatic and functional benefits are evident early (usually within 1-2 weeks).
Benefit of each analgesic must be established by a therapeutic trial and reassessed regularly.
Overall goal of analgesic therapy is improved function and quality of life.

What research is being done?
If you have lower back pain, you are not alone. Nearly everyone at some point has back pain that interferes with work, routine daily activities, or recreation. Americans spend at least $50 billion each year on low back pain, the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work. Back pain is the second most common neurological ailment in the United States � only headache is more common. Fortunately, most occurrences of low back pain go away within a few days. Others take much longer to resolve or lead to more serious conditions.
Acute or short-term low back pain generally lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Most acute back pain is mechanical in nature � the result of trauma to the lower back or a disorder such as arthritis. Pain from trauma may be caused by a sports injury, work around the house or in the garden, or a sudden jolt such as a car accident or other stress on spinal bones and tissues. Symptoms may range from muscle ache to shooting or stabbing pain, limited flexibility and/or range of motion, or an inability to stand straight. Occasionally, pain felt in one part of the body may �radiate� from a disorder or injury elsewhere in the body. Some acute pain syndromes can become more serious if left untreated.
Chronic back pain is measured by duration � pain that persists for more than 3 months is considered chronic. It is often progressive and the cause can be difficult to determine.
What structures make up the back?
The back is an intricate structure of bones, muscles, and other tissues that form the posterior part of the body�s trunk, from the neck to the pelvis. The centerpiece is the spinal column, which not only supports the upper body�s weight but houses and protects the spinal cord � the delicate nervous system structure that carries signals that control the body�s movements and convey its sensations. Stacked on top of one another are more than 30 bones � the vertebrae � that form the spinal column, also known as the spine. Each of these bones contains a roundish hole that, when stacked in register with all the others, creates a channel that surrounds the spinal cord. The spinal cord descends from the base of the brain and extends in the adult to just below the rib cage. Small nerves (�roots�) enter and emerge from the spinal cord through spaces between the vertebrae. Because the bones of the spinal column continue growing long after the spinal cord reaches its full length in early childhood, the nerve roots to the lower back and legs extend many inches down the spinal column before exiting. This large bundle of nerve roots was dubbed by early anatomists as the cauda equina, or horse�s tail. The spaces between the vertebrae are maintained by round, spongy pads of cartilage called intervertebral discs that allow for flexibility in the lower back and act much like shock absorbers throughout the spinal column to cushion the bones as the body moves. Bands of tissue known as ligaments and tendons hold the vertebrae in place and attach the muscles to the spinal column.
Starting at the top, the spine has four regions:
the seven cervical or neck vertebrae ,
the 12 thoracic or upper back vertebrae ,
the five lumbar vertebrae , which we know as the lower back, and
the sacrum and coccyx, a group of bones fused together at the base of the spine.
The lumbar region of the back, where most back pain is felt, supports the weight of the upper body.
Top
What causes lower back pain?
As people age, bone strength and muscle elasticity and tone tend to decrease. The discs begin to lose fluid and flexibility, which decreases their ability to cushion the vertebrae.
Pain can occur when, for example, someone lifts something too heavy or overstretches, causing a sprain, strain, or spasm in one of the muscles or ligaments in the back. If the spine becomes overly strained or compressed, a disc may rupture or bulge outward. This rupture may put pressure on one of the more than 50 nerves rooted to the spinal cord that control body movements and transmit signals from the body to the brain. When these nerve roots become compressed or irritated, back pain results.
Low back pain may reflect nerve or muscle irritation or bone lesions. Most low back pain follows injury or trauma to the back, but pain may also be caused by degenerative conditions such as arthritis or disc disease, osteoporosis or other bone diseases, viral infections, irritation to joints and discs, or congenital abnormalities in the spine. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, posture inappropriate for the activity being performed, and poor sleeping position also may contribute to low back pain. Additionally, scar tissue created when the injured back heals itself does not have the strength or flexibility of normal tissue. Buildup of scar tissue from repeated injuries eventually weakens the back and can lead to more serious injury.
Occasionally, low back pain may indicate a more serious medical problem. Pain accompanied by fever or loss of bowel or bladder control, pain when coughing, and progressive weakness in the legs may indicate a pinched nerve or other serious condition. People with diabetes may have severe back pain or pain radiating down the leg related to neuropathy. People with these symptoms should contact a doctor immediately to help prevent permanent damage.
Top
Who is most likely to develop low back pain?
Nearly everyone has low back pain sometime. Men and women are equally affected. It occurs most often between ages 30 and 50, due in part to the aging process but also as a result of sedentary life styles with too little (sometimes punctuated by too much) exercise. The risk of experiencing low back pain from disc disease or spinal degeneration increases with age.
Low back pain unrelated to injury or other known cause is unusual in pre-teen children. However, a backpack overloaded with schoolbooks and supplies can quickly strain the back and cause muscle fatigue. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that more than 13,260 injuries related to backpacks were treated at doctors� offices, clinics, and emergency rooms in the year 2000. To avoid back strain, children carrying backpacks should bend both knees when lifting heavy packs, visit their locker or desk between classes to lighten loads or replace books, or purchase a backpack or airline tote on wheels.
Top
What conditions are associated with low back pain?
Conditions that may cause low back pain and require treatment by a physician or other health specialist include:
Bulging disc (also called protruding, herniated, or ruptured disc). The intervertebral discs are under constant pressure. As discs degenerate and weaken, cartilage can bulge or be pushed into the space containing the spinal cord or a nerve root, causing pain. Studies have shown that most herniated discs occur in the lower, lumbar portion of the spinal column.
A much more serious complication of a ruptured disc is cauda equina syndrome, which occurs when disc material is pushed into the spinal canal and compresses the bundle of lumbar and sacral nerve roots. Permanent neurological damage may result if this syndrome is left untreated.
Sciatica is a condition in which a herniated or ruptured disc presses on the sciatic nerve, the large nerve that extends down the spinal column to its exit point in the pelvis and carries nerve fibers to the leg. This compression causes shock-like or burning low back pain combined with pain through the buttocks and down one leg to below the knee, occasionally reaching the foot. In the most extreme cases, when the nerve is pinched between the disc and an adjacent bone, the symptoms involve not pain but numbness and some loss of motor control over the leg due to interruption of nerve signaling. The condition may also be caused by a tumor, cyst, metastatic disease, or degeneration of the sciatic nerve root.
Spinal degeneration from disc wear and tear can lead to a narrowing of the spinal canal. A person with spinal degeneration may experience stiffness in the back upon awakening or may feel pain after walking or standing for a long time.
Spinal stenosis related to congenital narrowing of the bony canal predisposes some people to pain related to disc disease.
Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease marked by progressive decrease in bone density and strength. Fracture of brittle, porous bones in the spine and hips results when the body fails to produce new bone and/or absorbs too much existing bone. Women are four times more likely than men to develop osteoporosis. Caucasian women of northern European heritage are at the highest risk of developing the condition.
Skeletal irregularities produce strain on the vertebrae and supporting muscles, tendons, ligaments, and tissues supported by spinal column. These irregularities include scoliosis, a curving of the spine to the side; kyphosis, in which the normal curve of the upper back is severely rounded; lordosis, an abnormally accentuated arch in the lower back; back extension, a bending backward of the spine; and back flexion, in which the spine bends forward.
Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and multiple �tender points,� particularly in the neck, spine, shoulders, and hips. Additional symptoms may include sleep disturbances, morning stiffness, and anxiety.
Spondylitis refers to chronic back pain and stiffness caused by a severe infection to or inflammation of the spinal joints. Other painful inflammations in the lower back include osteomyelitis (infection in the bones of the spine) and sacroiliitis (inflammation in the sacroiliac joints).

How is low back pain diagnosed?
A thorough medical history and physical exam can usually identify any dangerous conditions or family history that may be associated with the pain. The patient describes the onset, site, and severity of the pain; duration of symptoms and any limitations in movement; and history of previous episodes or any health conditions that might be related to the pain. The physician will examine the back and conduct neurologic tests to determine the cause of pain and appropriate treatment. Blood tests may also be ordered. Imaging tests may be necessary to diagnose tumors or other possible sources of the pain.
A variety of diagnostic methods are available to confirm the cause of low back pain:
X-ray imaging includes conventional and enhanced methods that can help diagnose the cause and site of back pain. A conventional x-ray, often the first imaging technique used, looks for broken bones or an injured vertebra. A technician passes a concentrated beam of low-dose ionized radiation through the back and takes pictures that, within minutes, clearly show the bony structure and any vertebral misalignment or fractures. Tissue masses such as injured muscles and ligaments or painful conditions such as a bulging disc are not visible on conventional x-rays. This fast, noninvasive, painless procedure is usually performed in a doctor�s office or at a clinic.
Discography involves the injection of a special contrast dye into a spinal disc thought to be causing low back pain. The dye outlines the damaged areas on x-rays taken following the injection. This procedure is often suggested for patients who are considering lumbar surgery or whose pain has not responded to conventional treatments. Myelograms also enhance the diagnostic imaging of an x-ray. In this procedure, the contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal, allowing spinal cord and nerve compression caused by herniated discs or fractures to be seen on an x-ray.
Computerized tomography (CT) is a quick and painless process used when disc rupture, spinal stenosis, or damage to vertebrae is suspected as a cause of low back pain. X-rays are passed through the body at various angles and are detected by a computerized scanner to produce two-dimensional slices (1 mm each) of internal structures of the back. This diagnostic exam is generally conducted at an imaging center or hospital.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate the lumbar region for bone degeneration or injury or disease in tissues and nerves, muscles, ligaments, and blood vessels. MRI scanning equipment creates a magnetic field around the body strong enough to temporarily realign water molecules in the tissues. Radio waves are then passed through the body to detect the �relaxation� of the molecules back to a random alignment and trigger a resonance signal at different angles within the body. A computer processes this resonance into either a three-dimensional picture or a two-dimensional �slice� of the tissue being scanned, and differentiates between bone, soft tissues and fluid-filled spaces by their water content and structural properties. This noninvasive procedure is often used to identify a condition requiring prompt surgical treatment.
Electrodiagnostic procedures include electromyography
(EMG), nerve conduction studies, and evoked potential (EP) studies. EMG assesses the electrical activity in a nerve and can detect if muscle weakness results from injury or a problem with the nerves that control the muscles. Very fine needles are inserted in muscles to measure electrical activity transmitted from the brain or spinal cord to a particular area of the body. With nerve conduction studies the doctor uses two sets of electrodes (similar to those used during an electrocardiogram) that are placed on the skin over the muscles. The first set gives the patient a mild shock to stimulate the nerve that runs to a particular muscle. The second set of electrodes is used to make a recording of the nerve�s electrical signals, and from this information the doctor can determine if there is nerve damage. EP tests also involve two sets of electrodes � one set to stimulate a sensory nerve and the other set on the scalp to record the speed of nerve signal transmissions to the brain.
Bone scans are used to diagnose and monitor infection, fracture, or disorders in the bone. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream and will collect in the bones, particularly in areas with some abnormality. Scanner-generated images are sent to a computer to identify specific areas of irregular bone metabolism or abnormal blood flow, as well as to measure levels of joint disease.
Thermography involves the use of infrared sensing devices to measure small temperature changes between the two sides of the body or the temperature of a specific organ. Thermography may be used to detect the presence or absence of nerve root compression.
Ultrasound imaging, also called ultrasound scanning or sonography, uses high-frequency sound waves to obtain images inside the body. The sound wave echoes are recorded and displayed as a real-time visual image. Ultrasound imaging can show tears in ligaments, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissue masses in the back.

How is back pain treated?
Most low back pain can be treated without surgery. Treatment involves using analgesics, reducing inflammation, restoring proper function and strength to the back, and preventing recurrence of the injury. Most patients with back pain recover without residual functional loss. Patients should contact a doctor if there is not a noticeable reduction in pain and inflammation after 72 hours of self-care.
Although ice and heat (the use of cold and hot compresses) have never been scientifically proven to quickly resolve low back injury, compresses may help reduce pain and inflammation and allow greater mobility for some individuals. As soon as possible following trauma, patients should apply a cold pack or a cold compress (such as a bag of ice or bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel) to the tender spot several times a day for up to 20 minutes. After 2 to 3 days of cold treatment, they should then apply heat (such as a heating lamp or hot pad) for brief periods to relax muscles and increase blood flow. Warm baths may also help relax muscles. Patients should avoid sleeping on a heating pad, which can cause burns and lead to additional tissue damage.
Bed rest � 1�2 days at most. A 1996 Finnish study found that persons who continued their activities without bed rest following onset of low back pain appeared to have better back flexibility than those who rested in bed for a week. Other studies suggest that bed rest alone may make back pain worse and can lead to secondary complications such as depression, decreased muscle tone, and blood clots in the legs. Patients should resume activities as soon as possible. At night or during rest, patients should lie on one side, with a pillow between the knees (some doctors suggest resting on the back and putting a pillow beneath the knees).
Exercise may be the most effective way to speed recovery from low back pain and help strengthen back and abdominal muscles. Maintaining and building muscle strength is particularly important for persons with skeletal irregularities. Doctors and physical therapists can provide a list of gentle exercises that help keep muscles moving and speed the recovery process. A routine of back-healthy activities may include stretching exercises, swimming, walking, and movement therapy to improve coordination and develop proper posture and muscle balance. Yoga is another way to gently stretch muscles and ease pain. Any mild discomfort felt at the start of these exercises should disappear as muscles become stronger. But if pain is more than mild and lasts more than 15 minutes during exercise, patients should stop exercising and contact a doctor.
Medications are often used to treat acute and chronic low back pain. Effective pain relief may involve a combination of prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies. Patients should always check with a doctor before taking drugs for pain relief. Certain medicines, even those sold over the counter, are unsafe during pregnancy, may conflict with other medications, may cause side effects including drowsiness, or may lead to liver damage.
Over-the-counter
analgesics, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen), are taken orally to reduce stiffness, swelling, and inflammation and to ease mild to moderate low back pain. Counter-irritants applied topically to the skin as a cream or spray stimulate the nerve endings in the skin to provide feelings of warmth or cold and dull the sense of pain. Topical analgesics can also reduce inflammation and stimulate blood flow. Many of these compounds contain salicylates, the same ingredient found in oral pain medications containing aspirin.
Anticonvulsants
� drugs primarily used to treat seizures � may be useful in treating certain types of nerve pain and may also be prescribed with analgesics.
Some
antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and desipramine, have been shown to relieve pain (independent of their effect on depression) and assist with sleep. Antidepressants alter levels of brain chemicals to elevate mood and dull pain signals. Many of the new antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are being studied for their effectiveness in pain relief.
Opioids such as codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine are often prescribed to manage severe acute and chronic back pain but should be used only for a short period of time and under a physician�s supervision. Side effects can include drowsiness, decreased reaction time, impaired judgment, and potential for addiction. Many specialists are convinced that chronic use of these drugs is detrimental to the back pain patient, adding to depression and even increasing pain.
Spinal manipulation is literally a �hands-on� approach in which trained specialists (such as chiropractors, osteopaths, and massage therapists) use leverage and a series of exercises to adjust spinal structures and restore back mobility. These specialists do not prescribe drugs or use surgery in their treatment of low back pain.
When back pain does not respond to more conventional approaches, patients may consider the following options:
Acupuncture involves the insertion of needles the width of a human hair along precise points throughout the body. Practitioners believe this process triggers the release of naturally occurring painkilling molecules called peptides and keeps the body�s normal flow of energy unblocked. Clinical studies are measuring the effectiveness of acupuncture in comparison to more conventional procedures in the treatment of acute low back pain.
Biofeedback is used to treat many acute pain problems, most notably back pain and headache. Using a special electronic machine, the patient is trained to become aware of, to follow, and to gain control over certain bodily functions, including muscle tension, heart rate, and skin temperature (by controlling local blood flow patterns). The patient can then learn to effect a change in his or her response to pain, for example, by using relaxation techniques. Biofeedback is often used in combination with other treatment methods, generally without side effects.
Interventional therapy can ease chronic pain by blocking nerve conduction between specific areas of the body and the brain. Approaches range from injections of local anesthetics, steroids, or narcotics into affected soft tissues, joints, or nerve roots to more complex nerve blocks and spinal cord stimulation. When extreme pain is involved, low doses of drugs may be administered by catheter directly into the spinal cord. Chronic use of steroid injections may lead to increased functional impairment.
Traction involves the use of weights to apply constant or intermittent force to gradually �pull� the skeletal structure into better alignment. Traction is not recommended for treating acute low back symptoms.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is administered by a battery-powered device that sends mild electric pulses along nerve fibers to block pain signals to the brain. Small electrodes placed on the skin at or near the site of pain generate nerve impulses that block incoming pain signals from the peripheral nerves. TENS may also help stimulate the brain�s production of endorphins (chemicals that have pain-relieving properties).
Ultrasound is a noninvasive therapy used to warm the body�s internal tissues, which causes muscles to relax. Sound waves pass through the skin and into the injured muscles and other soft tissues.
Minimally invasive outpatient treatments to seal fractures of the vertebrae caused by osteoporosis include vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Vertebroplasty uses three-dimensional imaging to help a doctor guide a fine needle into the vertebral body. A glue-like epoxy is injected, which quickly hardens to stabilize and strengthen the bone and provide immediate pain relief. In kyphoplasty, prior to injecting the epoxy, a special balloon is inserted and gently inflated to restore height to the bone and reduce spinal deformity.
In the most serious cases, when the condition does not respond to other therapies, surgery may relieve pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. Some surgical procedures may be performed in a doctor�s office under local anesthesia, while others require hospitalization. It may be months following surgery before the patient is fully healed, and he or she may suffer permanent loss of flexibility. Since invasive back surgery is not always successful, it should be performed only in patients with progressive neurologic disease or damage to the peripheral nerves.
Discectomy is one of the more common ways to remove pressure on a nerve root from a bulging disc or bone spur. During the procedure the surgeon takes out a small piece of the lamina (the arched bony roof of the spinal canal) to remove the obstruction below.
Foraminotomy is an operation that �cleans out� or enlarges the bony hole (foramen) where a nerve root exits the spinal canal. Bulging discs or joints thickened with age can cause narrowing of the space through which the spinal nerve exits and can press on the nerve, resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness in an arm or leg. Small pieces of bone over the nerve are removed through a small slit, allowing the surgeon to cut away the blockage and relieve the pressure on the nerve.
IntraDiscal Electrothermal Therapy (IDET) uses thermal energy to treat pain resulting from a cracked or bulging spinal disc. A special needle is inserted via a catheter into the disc and heated to a high temperature for up to 20 minutes. The heat thickens and seals the disc wall and reduces inner disc bulge and irritation of the spinal nerve.
Nucleoplasty uses radiofrequency energy to treat patients with low back pain from contained, or mildly herniated, discs. Guided by x-ray imaging, a wand-like instrument is inserted through a needle into the disc to create a channel that allows inner disc material to be removed. The wand then heats and shrinks the tissue, sealing the disc wall. Several channels are made depending on how much disc material needs to be removed.
Radiofrequency lesioning is a procedure using electrical impulses to interrupt nerve conduction (including the conduction of pain signals) for 6 to12 months. Using x-ray guidance, a special needle is inserted into nerve tissue in the affected area. Tissue surrounding the needle tip is heated for 90-120 seconds, resulting in localized destruction of the nerves.
Spinal fusion is used to strengthen the spine and prevent painful movements. The spinal disc(s) between two or more vertebrae is removed and the adjacent vertebrae are �fused� by bone grafts and/or metal devices secured by screws. Spinal fusion may result in some loss of flexibility in the spine and requires a long recovery period to allow the bone grafts to grow and fuse the vertebrae together.
Spinal laminectomy (also known as spinal decompression) involves the removal of the lamina (usually both sides) to increase the size of the spinal canal and relieve pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots.
Other surgical procedures to relieve severe chronic pain include rhizotomy, in which the nerve root close to where it enters the spinal cord is cut to block nerve transmission and all senses from the area of the body experiencing pain; cordotomy, where bundles of nerve fibers on one or both sides of the spinal cord are intentionally severed to stop the transmission of pain signals to the brain; and dorsal root entry zone operation, or DREZ, in which spinal neurons transmitting the patient�s pain are destroyed surgically.

Can back pain be prevented?
Recurring back pain resulting from improper body mechanics or other nontraumatic causes is often preventable. A combination of exercises that don't jolt or strain the back, maintaining correct posture, and lifting objects properly can help prevent injuries.
Many work-related injuries are caused or aggravated by stressors such as heavy lifting, contact stress (repeated or constant contact between soft body tissue and a hard or sharp object, such as resting a wrist against the edge of a hard desk or repeated tasks using a hammering motion), vibration, repetitive motion, and awkward posture. Applying ergonomic principles � designing furniture and tools to protect the body from injury � at home and in the workplace can greatly reduce the risk of back injury and help maintain a healthy back. More companies and homebuilders are promoting ergonomically designed tools, products, workstations, and living space to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury and pain.
The use of wide elastic belts that can be tightened to �pull in� lumbar and abdominal muscles to prevent low back pain remains controversial. A landmark study of the use of lumbar support or abdominal support belts worn by persons who lift or move merchandise found no evidence that the belts reduce back injury or back pain. The 2-year study, reported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in December 2000, found no statistically significant difference in either the incidence of workers� compensation claims for job-related back injuries or the incidence of self-reported pain among workers who reported they wore back belts daily compared to those workers who reported never using back belts or reported using them only once or twice a month.
Although there have been anecdotal case reports of injury reduction among workers using back belts, many companies that have back belt programs also have training and ergonomic awareness programs. The reported injury reduction may be related to a combination of these or other factors.

Quick tips to a healthier back
Following any period of prolonged inactivity, begin a program of regular low-impact exercises. Speed walking, swimming, or stationary bike riding 30 minutes a day can increase muscle strength and flexibility. Yoga can also help stretch and strengthen muscles and improve posture. Ask your physician or orthopedist for a list of low-impact exercises appropriate for your age and designed to strengthen lower back and abdominal muscles.
Always stretch before exercise or other strenuous physical activity.
Don�t slouch when standing or sitting. When standing, keep your weight balanced on your feet. Your back supports weight most easily when curvature is reduced.
At home or work, make sure your work surface is at a comfortable height for you.
Sit in a chair with good lumbar support and proper position and height for the task. Keep your shoulders back. Switch sitting positions often and periodically walk around the office or gently stretch muscles to relieve tension. A pillow or rolled-up towel placed behind the small of your back can provide some lumbar support. If you must sit for a long period of time, rest your feet on a low stool or a stack of books.
Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.
Sleep on your side to reduce any curve in your spine. Always sleep on a firm surface.
Ask for help when transferring an ill or injured family member from a reclining to a sitting position or when moving the patient from a chair to a bed.
Don�t try to lift objects too heavy for you. Lift with your knees, pull in your stomach muscles, and keep your head down and in line with your straight back. Keep the object close to your body. Do not twist when lifting.
Maintain proper nutrition and diet to reduce and prevent excessive weight, especially weight around the waistline that taxes lower back muscles. A diet with sufficient daily intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D helps to promote new bone growth.
If you smoke, quit. Smoking reduces blood flow to the lower spine and causes the spinal discs to degenerate.

What research is being done?
Scientists are examining the use of different drugs to effectively treat back pain, in particular daily pain that has lasted at least 6 months. Other studies are comparing different health care approaches to the management of acute low back pain (standard care versus chiropractic, acupuncture, or massage therapy). These studies are measuring symptom relief, restoration of function, and patient satisfaction. Other research is comparing standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard nonsurgical treatments to measure changes in health-related quality of life among patients suffering from spinal
stenosis.
Other researchers are studying whether low-dose radiation can decrease scarring around the spinal cord and improve the results of surgery. Still others are exploring why spinal cord injury and other neurological changes lead to an increased sensitivity to pain or a decreased pain threshold (where normally non-painful sensations are perceived as painful, a class of symptoms called neuropathic pain), and how fractures of the spine and their repair affect the spinal canal and intervertebral foramena (openings around the spinal roots).
Also under study for patients with degenerative disc disease is artificial spinal disc replacement surgery. The damaged disc is removed and a metal and plastic disc about the size of a quarter is inserted into the spine. Ideal candidates for disc replacement surgery are persons between the ages of 20 and 60 who have only one degenerating disc, do not have a systemic bone disease such as osteoporosis, have not had previous back surgery, and have failed to respond to other forms of nonsurgical treatment. Compared to other forms of back surgery, recovery from this form of surgery appears to be shorter and the procedure has fewer complications.

does yogurt cultures work to cure bacterial vaginosis?

I’ve read on various sites about using the plain yogurt or capsule/tablets to cure BV. Has anyone tried it? How to get the capsules in there and dissolve?
Here’s where I heard of it, was hoping someone here had actually tried it.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition of the vagina caused by an overgrowth of various bacteria (germs). It is not just a simple infection caused by one type of bacterium.
The main symptom of BV is a vaginal discharge. BV is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women of childbearing age. The discharge is often a white-grey colour, and often has a fishy smell. The smell may be most noticeable when having sex. The discharge tends to be heaviest just after a period, and after having sex.
The discharge of BV does not usually cause itch or soreness around the vagina and vulva.
Many women with BV do not have any symptoms (up to half of cases). These women may be found to have BV by chance when vaginal swabs are taken for other reasons.
Note: BV is not the only cause of a vaginal discharge. Various conditions can cause a discharge. For example, the second most common cause of a discharge is due to thrush which is an infection caused by a yeast called candida. Unlike BV, thrush typically causes a thicker white discharge which tends to cause itch and soreness around the vagina and vulva.
Human Studies From Four Different Hospitals
Four human clinical trial studies in four different hospitals have been completed to date, including 124 patients.
The studies were designed to test the oral use of the product (at 10 ppm) to treat 18 different human ailments and diseases. In these studies there were no failures, and almost all patients were deemed as fully recovered in less than one week.
The studies included ailments such as: upper respiratory tract infections, eye infections, ear infections, urinary tract infections, sore throats, abdominal pain and diarrhea, bronchitis, vaginal yeast infections, external cuts, gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease, various mouth problems, retro viral infections, Malaria, etc.
The product was found to be so effective that the country of Ghana approved the product as an antibiotic-alternative drug.

Yogurt helps with YEAST infections.BV, as you know. is a bacterial vaccine. Quite different. For example, a yeast infection can occur after being on an antibiotic,sometimes even with frequent intercourse. A yeast infection is usually white,thick cottage cheese appearance, itch, with a slight or no odor.. BV usually has a fishy odor and the discharge is thin, milky and yellowish/slight greenish discharge. I guess depending on your symptoms, you’ll know if it’s yeast or BV. If it’s BV, then you need to contact your doctor and have medication prescribed to you IE: Metrogel. Good Luck!!

It does work for yeast infections, if you do it as soon as you feel the symptoms,but i’m not sure about bacterial vaginosis. It’s about balancing out the natural bacteria in our system. It should be plain yogurt.

I also don’t think yogurt will help with BV. I’ve actually read that hydrogen peroxide helps eliminate BV.
See this link:

I thought about using hydrogen peroxide in there the other day, and figured I do a search to see it it’s safe, and wooo laaa!

Yogurt is used to treat yeast– not bacteria. Only your doctor can prescribe medication to clear a bacterial infection.

I have never heard of yogurt or yogurt culture tabs curing bacterial vaginosis. I have heard of it using yogurt to cure vaginal yeast infections, however. Bacterial vaginosos is caused by introduction of bacteria not native to the vagina into the vagina where they grow and can cause a discharge and foul odor. It can also cause PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) if not treated appropriately with antibiotics. vaginal yeast is caused by the candida yeast bacteria that occurs naturally in the vagina along with many other ""critters"" that occur there naturally and usually all live in harmony until something happens to change the natural balance. Taking antibiotics for other problems (such as ear infections, urinary tract infections, skin infections, etc.) can kill off many of the naturally occuring bacteria that help keep the yeast in check (like cats keep rats under control). When the yeast gets over populated then you have what is called a ""yeast infection"" with cottage cheesy discharge and some really bad itching. This can be treated sometime in the earlier stages with yogurt; by eating yogurt or douching with yogurt (or dissolved yogurt culture tabs). It is more commonly treated, however with preparations like monistat or clotrimazole cream or suppositories (which can be bought over the counter at your local pharmacy) or diflucan pills (which are sold by prescription).

Fluconazole Plus Probiotics: Fighting Yeast Infections
Probiotics are live microorganisms (in most cases, bacteria) that are similar to beneficial microorganisms found in the human gut. Probiotics come mainly in the form of dietary supplements and foods, such as yogurt.
Probiotics are frequently used by women to help prevent vaginal infections, although research has shown mixed results.
Researchers at the University of Sao Paolo in Brazil achieved a positive result in their study, demonstrating “that probiotic lactobacilli can increase the effectiveness of an anti-fungal pharmaceutical agent”. 1 The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial found that taking four weeks of a combination of two Lactobacillus species after a single dose of the anti-yeast drug fluconazole, decreased the recurrence rate of vaginal yeast infection by 71 percent, compared to fluconazole plus placebo. Fluconazole is the generic name for Diflucan.
1. Lett Appl Microbiol. 2009 Mar;48(3):269-74. Epub 2009 Feb
Improved treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis with fluconazole plus probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14.Martinez RC, Franceschini SA, Patta MC, Quintana SM, Candido RC, Ferreira JC, De Martinis EC, Reid G.Departamento de Análises Clínicas, Toxicológicas e Bromatológicas, Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil.
AIMS: To determine the ability of probiotic lactobacilli to improve the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) using a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-five women diagnosed with VVC by vaginal discharge positive for Candida spp. (according to culture method) associated with at least one of the symptoms (itching and burning vaginal feeling, dyspareunia and dysuria), were treated with single dose of fluconazole (150 mg) supplemented every morning for the following 4 weeks with two placebo or two probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14). At 4 weeks, the probiotic treated group showed significantly less vaginal discharge associated with any of the above mentioned symptoms (10.3%vs 34.6%; P = 0.03) and lower presence of yeast detected by culture (10.3%vs 38.5%; P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that probiotic lactobacilli can increase the effectiveness of an anti-fungal pharmaceutical agent in curing disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This novel finding of probiotic lactobacilli augmenting the cure rate of yeast vaginitis, not only offers an alternative approach to a highly prevalent condition that adversely affects the quality of life of women around the world, but also raises the question of how this combination works.

Probiotics are increasingly being used to treat and prevent urogenital infections. However, a critical assessment of their efficacy in major urogenital infections is lacking. We report the results of a systematic review to determine the efficacy of probiotics for prevention or treatment of three major urogenital infections: bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract infection. Using multiple computerized databases, we extracted data from clinical trials using a lactobacillus-containing preparation to either prevent or treat a urogenital infection. Of 25 included studies, 18 studies used lactobacillus preparations for treatment or prevention of urogenital infections and seven studies focused solely on vaginal colonization. Four studies included patients with vaginal candidiasis, five included patients with urinary tract infections, and eight included patients with bacterial vaginosis. One included several types of genitourinary infections. Overall, lactobacilli were beneficial for the treatment of patients with bacterial vaginosis. No clear benefit was seen for candidiasis or urinary tract infection. Studies were heterogeneous, with some limited by a small population size. In conclusion, the use of certain lactobacillus strains such as L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri for prevention and treatment of recurrent urogenital infection is promising, especially for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Scant data on the use of probiotics for urinary tract infection and vulvovaginal candidiasis precludes definitive recommendations. Further research and larger studies on types of lactobacilli strains, dosage of lactobacilli, optimal route and vehicle of administration are needed.
J Antimicrob Chemother. 2006 Aug;58(2):266-72. Epub 2006 Jun 21. Probiotics for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review.Falagas ME, Betsi GI, Athanasiou S.Alfa Institute of Biomedical Sciences (AIBS) Athens, Greece. m.falagas@aibs.gr
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection affecting the quality of life of many women. Probiotics have been investigated as possible agents for the prevention of recurrences of VVC. We reviewed the available literature. In some studies the development of VVC was associated with either a low number of lactobacilli in the vagina or with the presence of H2O2-non-producing vaginal lactobacilli, although there are a few studies not supporting these statements. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that lactobacilli can inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and/or its adherence on the vaginal epithelium. The results of some clinical trials support the effectiveness of lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14, administered either orally or intravaginally in colonizing the vagina and/or preventing the colonization and infection of the vagina by C. albicans, while the results of a small number of clinical trials do not corroborate these findings. Nevertheless, most of the relevant clinical trials had methodological problems such as small sample size, no control group (placebo) and included women without confirmed recurrent VVC, and thus they are not reliable for drawing definitive conclusions. Thus, the available evidence for the use of probiotics for prevention of recurrent VVC is limited. However, the empirical use of probiotics may be considered in women with frequent recurrence of VVC (more than three episodes per year), especially for those who have adverse effects from or contraindications for the use of antifungal agents, since adverse effects of probiotics are very rare. In any case women should be clearly informed about the unproven usefulness of probiotics for this purpose. In conclusion, despite the promising results of some studies, further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing the recurrences of VVC and to allow their wide use for this indication.

A Complete Guide To Probiotics
April 06, 2012

Probiotics are live microorganisms. The microorganisms are quite similar to the ones that are found in the human gut. There are quite a few different strains of the microorganisms in probiotics. The microorganisms in the human gut are consider beneficial. Probiotics are also referred to as good bacteria or friendly bacteria. The good bacteria in probiotics are usually available to people in the form of supplements or food. Probiotics are also used as complementary and alternative medicine. Many people use them to prevent illnesses and to treat certain illnesses. They are also used to support general health and well being.
There are a few side effects associated with probiotics. The side effects have not really been scientifically studied so it is hard to say if some side effects are more common than other side effects while using probiotics. It is reported that side effects are a rare occurrence when taking probiotics.
Abdominal discomfort is one of the most common side effects that is reported when using probiotics. People sometimes report feeling bloating after taking probiotics. Bloating happens when the digestive process produces excess gas. Feeling extremely full is a sign of bloating. Pain in the abdominal region is another side effect that users report while using probiotics. People need to see their doctor if they experience any kind of abdominal discomfort after they use the supplement.
Not only are abdominal pains and bloating some reported side effects but headaches are also commonly reported side effects of using probiotics. People who suffer from headaches after using probiotics should lower their dosage. Some people say that their headaches go away once their body becomes used to taking the probiotics supplement. People should contact their doctor if their headaches do not get better over time or if the headaches become severe.
Some reports of probiotics say that a small number of people should not take the supplement because they could become more prone to catching infections, mainly fungal infections. Sometimes the infections can happen more often due to the immune system being compromised. Intestinal infections are other types of infections that can occur as a result of taking probiotics. Anybody who gets symptoms of infection after taking the supplement should call their doctor.
Diarrhea has been reported as one of the side effects of using probiotics. Diarrhea has not been a commonly reported side effect and probiotics are also used to treat diarrhea.
Skin rashes are rare when using probiotics supplements but rashes have been reported in some cases.
A person who experiences any abnormal changes in their body after taking probiotics should contact their doctor and make an appointment to see them.
Side effects are quite rare when using probiotics but they do happen once in a while.
Probiotics Supplements
Probiotics supplements are sold in many different places. A lot of probiotics supplements come in pill form but sometimes the supplements come in liquid form too but pill form is the most common form the probiotics come in. Powder form is also a popular form that it comes in. The powder is simply stirred into a drink such as water and then consumed by drinking it.
Probiotics supplements are made by many manufacturers. Research on companies and manufacturers of probiotics is needed when a person decides to buy the supplement because some probiotic supplements may be better than others as some manufacturers may use slightly different ingredients than other manufacturers.
Many manufacturers will make their own recommendations on when to take the probiotics supplements. However, most companies recommend taking probiotics supplements before breakfast with a glass of water. After taking it, a person should wait around twenty minutes before eating because this will help a person get the full benefits of the supplement. The probiotics supplements should not be taken within three hours of consuming an antibiotic.
Almost every single company will recommend taking probiotics right around meal time, most likely breakfast time.
Side effects are usually mild but there are rare cases where the supplement has been linked to major side effects.
Probiotics Benefits
There are many positive benefits of taking probiotics. There are some reports that say that one of the benefits of consuming probiotics is an enhanced immune system response. Sometimes antibiotics can cause negative side effects but probiotics can reduce those negative side effects.
A lot of people experience colon inflammation after a surgery. Probiotics actually helps treating the inflammation as well as preventing it.
Eczema is a nuisance for many people but youths can take measures to prevent eczema. Eczema is a nasty rash that can cause severe itching. The skin condition is something that is very hard to treat. However, one of the measures that can be taken to treat eczema is probiotics supplements. Eczema prevention is one of the benefits of taking it.
Another benefit of probiotics is that a person can expect to digest food better because their ability to digest food will increase.
The overall immune system gets enhanced too and this acts as a therapeutic for viral tract infections.
Lactose intolerance is reduced when taking probiotics. Incidents of vaginitis, yeast infections and candidiasis are also reduced when taking the probiotics supplements. Women love taking it because of these benefits. Many women do not know how to effectively reduce incidents of yeast infections and vaginitis and taking probiotics is one of the best things to take to reduce such incidents.
Probiotics also help with bad breathe. Bad breathe is a very common problem among many people. Bad breathe causes thousands and thousands of people embarrassment and shame. Many do not know how to battle bad breathe. There are way too many remedies out there that claim they battle bad breathe but often people are let down by such products making such claims. However, many people believe that the best remedy for bad breathe are probiotics supplements. There are many reports out there that show that probiotics work very well in preventing and even curing bad breathe.
Probiotics may help with preventing cavities. Preventing cavities is something that many people try to do. Brushing teeth and using mouthwash are both great ways to prevent cavities but taking probiotics is possibly another way to prevent cavities. There are not a lot of studies out there to back up the claims but many people do believe the good bacteria can prevent cavities. There is a small amount of studies that do claim certain strains of probiotics can prevent cavities.
Probiotics are also great for digestive disorders. Digestive disorders such as IBS, diarrhea and constipation are some common forms of digestive disorders. These disorders are uncomfortable and can cause a person to feel a lot of abdominal pain. A lot of people feel helpless when they suffer from digestive disorder symptoms. However, probiotics alleviates disorders such as diarrhea, IBS and constipation. The benefits are usually noticed shortly after consumption. Many elderly people seem to have issues with constipation and this is why they love the benefits of taking probiotics. A lot of elderly believe that the symptoms of constipation are reduced shortly after taking the probiotics supplements.
There are a lot of men and women who encounter bladder infections. Bladder infections can be treated with different types of medicines but the treatments may not always be effective. People who suffer or experience bladder infections frequently should give probiotics a try because there are many studies out there that show they are effective at relieving symptoms of bladder infections and sometimes even curing them too. Men and women have reported positive improvements in bladder infections’ symptoms shortly after taking probiotics.
There are some studies out there that show that probiotics promote healthy bacteria in the colon. This is great news but it is amazing news for men because a lot of men suffer from problems relating to the colon but probiotics help lower the conversion of bile into carcinogens in the colon. Colon cancer is one of the leading cause of deaths in men.
Probiotics increases the availability of vitamin K as well as fatty acids and lactase. They also produces very important enzymes.
Allergies affects millions of people all over the world. Allergies are sometimes hard to deal with. However, there is some good news for people who suffer from mild or severe allergies. A lot of people find that taking probiotics help relieve allergy symptoms.
Chronic fatigue suffers also can feel the benefits. One of the benefits of the probiotics supplements is that it helps relieves symptoms of chronic fatigue. People find themselves more energized and able to stay awake more shortly after consuming probiotics.
Nutrients such as vitamin B and calcium are affected by probiotics. Vitamin B is easier to synthesize because the supplements increases the ability to do so. Calcium is also absorbed easier because probiotics increases the ability to absorb calcium.
Cholesterol is something that affects all types of people and sometimes lowering it can be a difficult task. Probiotics actually can lower cholesterol in people. There have been many people who have said that their cholesterol have been lowered as a result of taking probiotics. Reducing blood pressure is another claim that is made by quite a few people who take probiotics.
Parasites are also something that a lot of men and women have to deal with. Some parasites can be harmful to the body and cause serious problems. Not only are probiotics good for types of fungal problems but they are also good for treating people with parasites and can sometimes prevent people from getting parasites. Parasites are often eliminated completely soon after consuming probiotics supplements or food with probiotics in them.
Stress is something that almost all people deal with. It does not matter how old somebody is or what their sex or race is, stress is something that is unavoidable at times. There are people who suffer from stress more than others and they find it hard to relax and relieve stress. Although there are not many studies about the positive benefits that probiotics have on people who deal with stress, there are a few studies that say probiotics actually help people who suffer from stress. Some foods and probiotics supplements boosts peoples’ overall moods and helps them cope with stress a lot easier.
Probiotics Yogurt
The good bacteria is also found in yogurt. Different strains of the good bacteria are found in different yogurts. This means that all yogurts are not created equal when it comes to probiotics. Some strains of the bacteria are considered to be more beneficial than others, so it is important to read the labels on yogurt carefully. Read on and find out the different types of strains that are found in some types of yogurts. Almost all yogurts have some form or amounts of probiotics in them. However, probiotic yogurts have many more beneficial probiotics in them, and this is why they are called probiotic yogurts.
One of the most popular strains of the bacteria is Lactobacillus GG (or LGG) and it is found in many yogurts. LGG in yogurt has been shown to help people reduce the effects of diarrhea and atopic eczema in kids. LGG is also shown to reduce illness in kids who attend day care. LGG is the most studied strain of probiotics and is thought to have the most benefits. This is why LGG is found in many yogurts. Bifildobacterium is another strain that is commonly found in yogurts. Both of the strains are similar to good bacteria that is found naturally within the body.
There are many different brands of probiotic yogurts. Before discussing the types of brands who market probiotic yogurts, lets discuss how safe these types of yogurts are. Side effects of consuming probiotics were discussed earlier in the first paragraph and some of those side effects can occur due to eating probiotic yogurts. Read on and find out what possible side effects can occur from eating probiotic yogurts.
Although rare, bloating and gas is a reported side effect of eating probiotic yogurts. Bloating and gas are the two side effects that are most commonly reported after consuming probiotic yogurts. Gene transfer is another side effect that sometimes occur due to eating probiotic yogurts. Unhealthy metabolic activities is another side effect that is sometimes due to eating the yogurts. Sometimes another ingredient in the yogurt could be the cause of certain side effects and not the probiotics causing the side effects. A person should see a doctor if they experience any severe side effects or side effects that don’t go away within two or three weeks.
Now lets discuss the different types of yogurt brands that have probiotic yogurts on the market today and what kind of reputation they have.

Yoplait is not quite as popular as Activia is but many people do claim to experience great benefits in regards to their digestive system. Yoplait is said to be one of the best yogurts with probiotics in it because hundreds of people have claimed that Yoplait yogurts have helped their digestive system as well as making their bowels regular.

Natural Remedy for Bacterial Vaginosis – Do It Yourself Remedies For BV
September 1st, 2011
Are you looking for easy, natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis? Women experience bacterial vaginosis once in their lives that can be caused by hormonal imbalance, poor hygiene, or sexually transmitted. Symptoms accompanying bacterial vaginosis are foul-odor, greyish discharge and itching.
When the ob-gyne confirms your bacterial vaginosis, it is likely that you will receive prescriptions for antibacterial medications. You should take these medications for one week. Nonetheless, these medications can cause side-effects like harming the good bacteria found in your vagina.
Women often search for the natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis in order to permanently cure this illness. Antibacterial medications often provide temporary relief, as these destroy even the good bacteria that maintains the natural pH. Imbalanced pH levels result to bacterial vaginosis. There are available alternative treatments for bacterial vaginosis.
One good example of natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis is eating raw garlic. This would help fight the bad bacteria. You can also try apple cider vinegar or tea tree oil on your bath water. If you prefer an instant relief, try using a hydrogen peroxide solution for douche. If you really want to have the best natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis, you can also try to take acidophilus supplements.
Don’t waste time in treating bacterial vaginosis. It is best to look for cures the soonest you find out that you have bacterial vaginosis. Remember the natural remedy for bacterial vaginosis is good hygiene besides the herbal medications and supplements. This will prevent occurrence or recurrence of bacterial vaginosis.

What Are Some Natural Remedies For Bacterial Vaginosis? – I Have Been To The Gyno 3 Times And Nothing Has Helped!
August 31st, 2011
I have had bacterial vaginosis for over 4 months now and I have gone to my gyno three times. Two of the cream treatments he gave me to use, gave me severe allergic reactions and one of the pills didn’t work at all. I apparently have a very small amount of bad bacteria but it just won’t go away and I can’t have sex and it is putting a huge strain on my relationship. I also apparently don’t have enough healthy bacteria either which is why I didn’t want to take my gyno’s 4th suggested treatment because apparently it is harsh (a seven day pill treatment-can’t remember the name). I have been taking probiotics for a month and half now. Is there anything else I can do? I am desperate.
This is only one of the thousands of sad recurrent BV stories you will read on the internet when you browse around the web, finding a cure for this condition. I have had this condition too, and treated it! In this short article, I will try to give you some few recommendations that you can use to try treating your recurrent bacterial vaginosis and I will also provide links to some great internet sites where you can find even advanced help for your recurrent BV condition.
Treating recurrent bacterial vaginosis is really difficult and if you have been having it for some time and trying to search on the internet to find some kind of help, then you might have come across questions like the one asked above.
A bacterial vaginosis natural remedy can be used to treat this infection, instead of antibiotics. When bad bacteria attack a woman’s vagina, many uncomfortable symptoms can be experienced. These include burning, swelling, smelly and unpleasant discharge, soreness, inflammation, urinary discomfort, and pain during sex. Typically, what conventional doctors would recommend would be prescription drugs and creams to deal with these symptoms. However, there are also natural remedies that can help you deal with them.
Naturopathic doctors say that the vagina has its own ecosystem. Both good and bad bacteria can be found in this ecosystem. The good bacteria strains help your body from bad bacteria and other harmful organisms. A bacterial vaginosis natural remedy helps create an environment where bad organisms find difficult to thrive. It also restores the vagina’s normal pH, decrease irritation and inflammation, and do away with the infecting organisms. Still, the success of treating this condition is largely dependent on correctly diagnosing the root cause of the problem.
Vaginitis can happen because of 2 main reasons. It can be either from a bacterial infection, or from the fungal yeast Candida albicans. For a successful recovery, it is important that you use the appropriate treatment to target the type of bacteria, yeast or parasite that is invading your body. In the meantime, you should also avoid consuming processed sugar, refined carbohydrates or alcohol.
Ask your herbalist about the following options for a bacterial vaginosis natural remedy that is most suitable for your case:
1. Garlic can help fight against infections as it contains many antibacterial and antifungal properties. This is why it is one of the best herbal remedies for treating bacterial infections such as vaginal infections. If you wish to consume garlic in the form of a supplement, it should contain 5,000 micrograms of alliums (the compound in garlic that contains the highest infection-fighting properties ). Take 1 or 2 garlic capsules per day until the symptoms subside.
2. Goldenseal contains many immunity-boosting properties. It has a chemical that has been shown to fight off bacteria and Candida fungus that reside in the vagina’ mucous membranes. Generally, what is recommended is a dosage of about two 500-milligram goldenseal capsules once or twice a day until the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis recede.
3. Tracheal is a traditional herb that you can use to remove toxins such as bacteria or parasites from your body. You can also use this herb to restore a normal flow of bodily fluids. For a home remedy, simply soak one teaspoon of dried tracheal in 1 cup of hot water. Drink this as a tea before bedtime. If you dislike the taste of this tea, you can always consume two 500-milligram capsules of this bacterial vaginosis natural remedy before bedtime daily instead.
4. There is also this very great bacterial vaginosis cure guide which helped me a lot when I was struggling with my recurrent BV. The guide I am talking about is called: Bacterial Vaginosis Freedom written by Elena Peterson. I have recommended this guide to so many friends, family members and loved ones who had problems with recurrent BV, and most of them totally cured their condition just by following the recommendations in this guide. I will advise any woman who is struggling with persistent, chronic and recurrent BV to get a copy of the Bacterial Vaginosis Freedom guide and follow the recommendations in it.
Click here: Bacterial Vaginosis Freedom, to read more about this guide and see how it has been helping thousands of women all over the world in curing their recurrent bacterial vaginosis.

MagSpectrum
To help reverse the tide of widespread and debilitating magnesium deficiency, an innovative formula of 100% fully reacted amino acid chelates has been created called MagSpectrum�. Not all products that claim to be chelates are fully reacted to give the full benefits, whereas all the amino acid chelates in MagSpectrum� are rigorously tested to insure their quality.
120 Capsules
Our Price: $28.77
Quantity in Stock:524
Product Code: 42-120
Description
Ingredients
Precautions
Description:MagSpectrum� provides not one but 5 different kinds of fully reacted amino acid chelates to provide a wide range of benefits of restoring vital magnesium to all the parts of the body. MagSpectrum� thus provides a full range of generally and specifically targeted amino acid chelates to restore life and vitality-giving magnesium throughout the body.
Ingredients:Magnesium Chelate
Precautions:
Magnesium can cause loose stools and even diarrhea, particularly if taken as inorganic salts. The chelates are much less prone to this effect, but it is still prudent to divide your intake if possible to do so. As magnesium can relax muscles and balance the nervous system, if any adverse effects whatsoever are suspected, it is essential to hold the use of the supplement and contact your physician.
Contraindications to Magnesium Therapy:
Kidney Failure. With kidney failure there is an inability to clear magnesium from the kidneys.
Myasthenia gravis. Intravenous administration could accentuate muscle relaxation and collapse the respiratory muscles.
Excessively slow heart rate. Slow heart rates can be made even slower, as magnesium relaxes the heart. Slow heart rates often require an artificial pacemaker.
Bowel obstruction. The main route of elimination of oral magnesium is through the bowel.
Additional Info
Magnesium is one of the most widespread and important mineral deficiencies.
-Approximately 74% of Americans consume less than the recommended daily intake of magnesium.
-Stress, exercise, and ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, and refined sugar increase magnesium excretion.
-Excessive calcium consumption further aggravates magnesium balance through competitive antagonism for absorption in the small intestine.
-Dietary fiber and phytates bind ionized magnesium and diminish its absorption.
-Diuretic and corticosteroid medications as well as laxatives can cause severe magnesium wasting through the kidneys and gastrointestinal tracts.
-Based on these factors it is estimated that 90-95% of Americans are magnesium deficient.
The use and supplementation of inexpensive inorganic magnesium salts is one of the main reasons why magnesium deficiency is so widespread. These salts include oxides, citrates, carbonates, gluconates, sulfates, acetates, and lactates. To be absorbed, these salts must first be ionized, which requires adequate stomach acid. The ionized mineral may then be bound to dietary fiber, phosphates, phytates, and tannins and be rendered unabsorbable. Not only are dietary polyphenols bound, their antioxidant activity is depleted. Medications can also bind to the ionized mineral, resulting in both becoming unavailable. The remaining ionized magnesium then competes for absorption with calcium, zinc, iron, and several other minerals. These antagonistic effects are so great that studies have shown that grains supplemented with magnesium salts actually caused a net depletion of magnesium from the body.
""The use and supplementation of inexpensive inorganic magnesium salts is one of the main reasons why magnesium deficiency is so widespread. These salts include oxides, citrates, carbonates, gluconates, sulfates, acetates, and lactates. To be absorbed, these salts must first be ionized, which requires adequate stomach acid. The ionized mineral may then be bound to dietary fiber, phosphates, phytates, and tannins and be rendered unabsorbable.""
The key to effective supplementation is the form in which the magnesium is given.The body has a powerful natural transport mechanism for minerals in which amino acids wrap around the mineral to package it both for absorption and delivery to tissues. This process is known as amino acid chelation, as the amino acids surround the mineral like the pincers of a claw, the term ""chela"" being the Greek word for claw. The chelation process neutralizes the charge of the magnesium so that it no longer binds to dietary components or medications, preventing the formation of insoluble complexes that reduce absorption. The neutralization of charge also prevents the antagonistic competition for absorption of other minerals. Absorption and tissue delivery of the amino acid chelates is greatly enhanced through active transport mechanisms in the small intestine that actively bind to the amino acids to ferry them across the intestinal lining, into the blood stream, and into the cells.
The magnitude of increased absorption with true amino acid chelates is biologically profound. Comparing a magnesium amino acid chelate to magnesium oxide (a typical salt found in many supplements) the amino acid chelate had 9 times the absorption as the oxide. This study compared the use of the single mineral. If another inorganic mineral were given at the same time, such as calcium carbonate, the usual effect would be no reduction of the amino acid chelate, but a further 70-80% reduction of magnesium absorption from the oxide form. The net effect on absorption of chelated to inorganic magnesium, if two or more inorganic minerals are taken, can be 20-30 fold greater absorption or more of the amino acid chelate.
Magnesium is of therapeutic value in treating a myriad of symptoms and health conditions: � Anxiety & panic attacks � Hypoglycemia
� Asthma � Insomnia
� Blood clots � Kidney disease
� Bowel disease � Migraine
� Cystitis � Musculoskeletal conditions
� Depression� Nerve problems
� Obgyn problems � Toxicity
� Diabetes � Osteoporosis
� Fatigue � Raynaud's syndrome
� Heart disease � Tooth decay
� Hypertension
Magnesium opposes the cramping effects of calcium on muscle. Calcium causes muscles to contract and magnesium allows muscles to relax. An excess of calcium in relation to magnesium results in chronic muscular contraction. Related symptoms of magnesium deficiency include muscle cramping and spasm, chronic pain, irritability, insomnia, muscle tension, tremors, headaches, and body aches. Magnesium deficiency can cause muscle cramps with the slightest exertion and may cause cramps of the hands and feet at night.
Magnesium has a natural calming and balancing effect on the nervous system. The more serious the magnesium deficiency, the more anxious, edgy, and short-tempered the person may become. A person who jumps at the slightest provocation is likely to have a magnesium deficit. Persons who sustain a major magnesium loss are almost always hyperirritable. Adults with magnesium deficiency can develop memory loss, impaired concentration, apathy, and depression. In contrast, children may become hyperactive. Providing well-absorbed magnesium can calm the nerves and improve concentration in many highly stressed and anxious adults and calm hyperactive children.
Optimum bone metabolism requires sufficient magnesium. A deficiency of magnesium impairs the release of parathyroid hormone, the glandular secretion required for proper calcium absorption and formation of bones. Magnesium deficiency not only causes bones to be brittle, but the calcium meant for bone can be deposited harmfully. Such undesired placement includes deposition around joints to create painful bone spurs or in blood vessels to accelerate vascular disease. Because of antagonizing magnesium absorption, the use of inorganic calcium supplements to improve bone strength (e.g., carbonate, phosphate, sulfate, oxide, citrate, and gluconate) can worsen the condition the calcium was given to improve! Ingesting well-absorbed magnesium can strengthen the bones and help dissolve deposits of undesirably placed calcium. Ingesting well-absorbed magnesium can strengthen the bones and help dissolve deposits of undesirably placed calcium.
Cardiac health is vitally dependent on magnesium. Deficiency of magnesium may reduce relaxation of the heart and predispose to diastolic hypertension. Deficiency may increase contraction of arterial muscle that can contribute to systolic hypertension, and in more severe cases to spasm of the arteries that can cause heart attacks. Serious and even life threatening abnormal heart rhythms have resulted from magnesium deficiency, as magnesium is required for normal electrical conduction in the heart. Because cardiac medications such as diuretics can cause severe magnesium depletion and aggravate these risks, it is especially important to supply adequate magnesium in this setting. Sufficient delivery of bioavailable magnesium for persons with cardiac conditions may be life saving.
Severe magnesium deficiency can result in:
Seizures, muscular rigidity, and shock.
Pre-eclampsia in expectant mothers. This condition of overactive reflexes and elevated blood pressure can progress to life threatening eclampsia (shock, seizures, and multi-organ failure) if not successfully treated with magnesium.
PMS. Rapid relief has been reported following magnesium replacement.
Perhaps the most profoundly important role for magnesium is cellular energy production. There are three basic forms of energy - immediate, rapid burst, and sustained endurance. Immediate energy comes from stores of ATP, the primary energy molecule in the body. These stores are small and are consumed within a few minutes unless replenished. Creatine phosphate is a reserve form of energy in muscle that can replenish ATP for immediate energy. This process is magnesium dependent. Rapid burst energy is exemplified by anaerobic activities such as weight lifting and sprinting. Anaerobic muscle exertion requires high levels of ATP quickly and for short bursts. Anaerobic metabolism uses glucose as fuel to produce two molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose.
Endurance activities such as hiking, biking, or swimming uses the far more efficient process of aerobic metabolism that uses oxygen to completely combust glucose, producing 36 molecules of ATP for every molecule of glucose. Magnesium is required for several key enzymes in both anaerobic burst and aerobic endurance energy production. Without adequate magnesium, all forms of energy production - immediate, burst, and sustained, are impaired. If glucose is the fuel, magnesium is the spark plug without which energy is not effectively produced. Fatigue, poor energy levels, and reduced endurance are all symptoms of magnesium deficiency.
Scientific studies indicate the magnitude of energy and endurance effects offered through magnesium supplementation. A study of swimming endurance in rats divided the animals into three groups - placebo control, inorganic magnesium salt, and amino acid chelated magnesium. The control animals lasted only 10 minutes, those receiving the inorganic magnesium salt swam for 13 minutes, and those receiving the amino acid chelated magnesium endured substantially longer at 48 minutes. This experiment underscored the enormous importance of using the much more bioavailable amino acid chelated magnesium to derive the full benefits of greater energy and endurance. A double blind human clinical study explored the effects of chelated magnesium in persons with coronary artery disease and chest pain with exertion. The subjects receiving the amino acid chelated magnesium sustained 25% greater exertion on exercise testing compared to the placebo control group. In addition, the placebo control group required 29% more nitroglycerin for relief of episodes of chest pain. For many persons with fatigue, low energy, or poor endurance, taking high quality magnesium may provide a welcome and rapid boost in energy and performance.
To help reverse the tide of widespread and debilitating magnesium deficiency, an innovative formula of 100% fully reacted amino acid chelates has been created called MagSpectrum�. Not all products that claim to be chelates are fully reacted to give the full benefits, whereas all the amino acid chelates in MagSpectrum� are rigorously tested to insure their quality. MagSpectrum� provides not one but 5 different kinds of fully reacted amino acid chelates to provide a wide range of benefits of restoring vital magnesium to all the parts of the body.
The next type of chelate uses L-lysine and L-glycine known as a chelazome. This is the specific form that was used for cardiac patients to improve their exercise endurance and reduce their need for cardiac medication. The third type, Creatine Magna Power, combines creatine with magnesium to increase transport not only of magnesium but also of creatine through the GI tract. This form especially targets to muscle to improve muscular performance.
Magnesium aspartate, the fourth type of chelate, uses aspartic acid as the chelating agent. This form may especially improve the function of the brain and nervous system. The fifth type uses the amino acids L-glutamine and L-glycine. This version particularly supports the immune system, muscle, and brain performance.
MagSpectrum� thus provides a full range of generally and specifically targeted amino acid chelates to restore life and vitality-giving magnesium throughout the body. In persons who have been deficient for a long time, overall energy, well-being, and performance can be improved significantly within a few weeks.
MagSpectrum� is further enhanced with a laser process that can increase uniformity of shape and give an even greater boost to bioavailability.
Are There Tests to Prove Magnesium Deficiency?
Although ""total serum (blood) magnesium testing"" and ""red and white blood cell magnesium testing"" can be used, these tests are not completely accurate as they do not measure the amount of magnesium held in other parts of the body. The most important consideration is that significant depletion in the cell may be present even if the blood test gives a level in the normal range. Magnesium depletion in the cell must be severe before blood tests will show a reduced magnesium level. However, even with this criterion, studies have still shown up to a 65% prevalence of magnesium deficiency.
The option of a ""blood ionized magnesium test"" involves a very refined procedure and may be considered the most accurate and reliable blood test available. Magnesium ions constitute the physiologically active fraction on magnesium in the body - they are not attached to other substances and are free to join in biochemical body processes. With the blood ionized magnesium test, ion-selective electrodes are used to directly measure the levels of magnesium ions in whole blood, plasma and serum.
Using intracellular testing, typically of cells swabbed from the inside of the mouth, has shown magnesium deficiency in over 90% of persons tested. This kind of testing is known as ""the buccal cell smear test"". The total mineral levels in the buccal cells correlate with the results from white blood cells and red blood cells. Analysis is performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental X-ray analysis (EXA). Similarly to the red and white blood cell magnesium testing, the only downfall of buccal smear testing is that is doesn't measure active, free magnesium ions.
For many people, including those who do not have easy access to the ionized blood test or even the buccal cell smeartest, it will be far more practical to observe for any of the many symptoms of magnesium depletion and observe if improvement occurs with appropriate supplementation.
Because of the widespread deficiency of magnesium due to inadequate intake, stress and lifestyle factors, and even medications, magnesium supplementation of amino acid chelates can be strongly recommended for almost everyone.
Suggested Usage:
To receive the recommended daily allowance of 400mg of magnesium, it is advised to take 4 capsules of MagSpectrum� daily, preferably divided into 2 capsules twice daily.
For children up to 8 years old, one capsule per day is advised. For children aged 9-13, 2-3 capsules per day may be taken, preferably divided into 1-2 capsules in the morning and one capsule in the evening.
Additionally, the fastest method to track the progress of re-mineralizing the body, and the only highly reliable one for magnesium, is intracellular mineral testing. This is done from a swab of the lining of the mouth.

Drugs that can cause leg cramps
Posted by medconsumers on December 28, 2011
Painful cramps in the legs or feet that disrupt sleep are impervious to treatment. The use of magnesium supplements and daily stretching exercises have been proven ineffective. And the anti-malaria drug Quinine, though often prescribed, is both dangerous and unproven. A team of Canadian researchers have identified several widely used prescription drugs that are a likely cause of these severe muscle contractions.
The new study, which was conducted in the province of British Columbia, used an ingenious way of sorting out the drugs most likely to trigger leg cramps. They fall into three frequently prescribed drug classes—diuretics for heart failure and hypertension, cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and inhaled long-acting β2-agonists for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study, entitled “Nocturnal Leg Cramps and Prescription Use That Precedes Them,” was led by Scott R. Garrison, MD, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and published recently online in Archives of Internal Medicine.
In Canada and the U.S., doctors frequently prescribe Quinine for nighttime leg cramps, though the drug has never been proven effective for this purpose. Most government drug regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, have issued warnings against the use of Quinine for leg cramps because of severe, potentially fatal adverse effects. Still, the practice lives on in both countries. Quinine was the first effective treatment for malaria.
Since British Columbia is not a hotbed of malarial disease the researchers focused their attention on Quinine prescriptions, stating that they could be reasonably certain that the drug was prescribed “almost exclusively” for the prevention of leg cramping.
Thanks to two databases maintained by this province, the researchers had access to information on all prescriptions dispensed and all physician services and hospitalizations paid by its taxpayer-supported health care system. The third database included all vital statistics such as date of death for the period between 1996 and 2009. The study was funded by the government of British Columbia.
The researchers began the sorting-out process by confining their study to people over the age of 50 years because nocturnal leg cramps are uncommon in younger adults. Then they singled out the people given first-ever Quinine prescriptions between 2001 and 2006. After that, they worked backward to see whether some drugs were prescribed more frequently in the years leading up to the Quinine prescriptions. The provincial databases allowed for comparison of similar populations who did and did not receive Quinine prescriptions.
Here’s what the researchers found: Of the three drug classes with the strongest link to leg cramps, statin drugs had the weakest association. Statins are known to cause muscle symptoms, but myopathy (muscle weakness) is more likely than cramps.
The two drug classes with the strongest links to leg cramps are the diuretics and the inhaled long-acting β2-agonists (some brands: Advair, Serevent, Symbicort). Quinine was substantially more likely to be (mis)prescribed in the year following a prescription from one of these two drug classes. When the researchers broke things down further in the diuretic class, which has a wide range of brand names and three subgroups, the potassium-sparing diuretics (some brands: Aldactone, Dyrenium, Midamor) and thiazidelike diuretics (Zytanix, Zaroxolyn, Mykrox) were even more likely to cause leg cramps than loop diuretics.
The researchers explained why they thought of leg cramps as a drug side effect. For starters, they are common to people over the age of 50 years, and this is the same group likely to be on multiple drug therapy. “Instead of stopping the drug likely to cause the leg cramps many doctors are inclined to prescribe yet another drug in the hope of stopping the leg cramps.”
What should people do if they have leg cramps and are taking one of the drugs most likely to be the cause? Dr. Garrison, the lead author of this study, answered this question by e-mail, “Nocturnal leg cramps can be very difficult to treat. If someone suffering cramps is on either an inhaled beta-agonist or a potassium-sparing diuretic they should ask their doctor if other treatment options could be considered. Is drug treatment for their condition essential? If so, inhaled anticholinergics are a good alternative to beta-agonists that do not promote cramps, and their doctors will know many alternatives to diuretics for the treatment of high blood pressure.”

I ended up with restless legs syndrome when I was pregnant. It turned out to be caused by all the calcium supplements that were prescribed for me. The solution ended up to be a form of iron (Iron Bisglycinate).
I could replicate the results once I figured it out–take the calcium or tums–I had restless legs syndrome almost immediately. Take the iron bisglycinate, and the symptoms subsided.
Just another example of unintended results from following your doctors orders. And I’d like to add that while leg cramps or restless legs syndrome sounds trivial–it’s definitely not. While it’s dismissed as unimportant–”well you can’t die from it” — it was impossible to sleep much at all, and the sleep deprivation was the really horrible experience. It certainly felt like I could die from it.

I am prescribed both furosemide and spironolactone, but had assumed that nocturnal leg cramps were related to peripheral neuropathy that developed a few years ago. I had worked my dose of furosemide down to half a tablet three days a week, from one tablet daily. On the much lower dosage, my legs and feet do not swell unless I eat food high in sodium, despite advanced heart failure. The leg cramps used to be more frequent. Now, having read your article, I see why that may be.
Homeopathy is a good fix for me — Hyland’s “Nerve Tonic” has the mineral phosphate of calcium, iron, potassium, and sodium, as well as magnesium, all in 3X, and works very nicely.
Quinine may be problematic in its common form, but homeopathic quinine (cinchona off.) can be helpful in cramping as well, without the adverse effects — try a 6 or 12 potency, either X or C.

An easy, drug-free way to manage leg cramps has been described recently n/in some sites/publications: extend the legs fully and stretch the toes forcefully for a few seconds. The cramping stops. Sometimes you may have to repeat this soon after.
It works for me. I am 87 and my choice of diuretic has been hydreochlorothiazide, It controls my BP and ny sense is that it is the most benign choice when potential side effects of the altenatives are considered. I have been getting nocturnal leg cramps at most once or twice a week.

My preferred method of medical practice is homeopathy. I am 83 and infrequently suffer from leg cramps, but when they hit, I grab my bottle of Hyland’s #8 Mag. Phnos 6X, short for magnesia Phophorica. I place three of the small pellets under my tongue every five minutes and within two doses, the leg un-cramps. My MD homeopath suggested I try these years ago and it works every time. They are available from health food stores and if not on their shelves, they can be ordered easily. And the cost is usually under $10 for a bottle that will last for years.

Margaret, it’s great to know somebody else finds homeopathy useful. Hyland’s has a combination remedy called “Leg cramps with Quinine” The quinine, of course is in homeopathic potency (3X), so will not cause the adverse effects quinine can cause. The remedy also contains Viscum Album, Gnaphalium Polycephalum, Rhus Tox, Aconitum Mapellus, Ledum Palustre, as well as your preferred mineral, Magnesia Phosphorica in 6X potency. I find this works very nicely whenever a foot cramp attacks, usually in the morning.

I do not take prescription drugs aside from thyroid. I associate my leg cramps with lack of sleep!!!! I am 81 years od age, and have had leg cramp problems that I trace back to vincristine, that was prescrived while I had breast cancer; which is not present now. I also get hand cramps.

Antidepressant May Aid Brain Function After Stroke
During the first three months after a stroke, an antidepressant may help a person recover thinking, learning, memory and verbal skills. This news came from a small, simply designed study that was published February 2 in Archives of General Psychiatry.
It included 129 people who had a recent stroke. None of the individuals who enrolled had depression. They were divided into groups that received the medicine escitalopram (Lexapro), a placebo pill or mental exercises to improve problem-solving skills. Escitalopram is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug (SSRI).
After three months of treatment, people who took escitalopram scored better on tests of logic and memory. Memory seemed to improve for both words and pictures. The people in this group also scored slightly better on one section of a test that aims to measure ""functional independence."" This includes problem solving, memory, attention and judgment related to safety issues.
It is difficult to know how large the ""real life"" benefit may be or whether longer treatment might have showed added benefit.
The authors suggest that the antidepressant may allow more chemical and electrical connections to form between cells. This is not proven though. This stroke study did not evaluate recovery of strength or muscle function, only cognitive (thinking) function. Use of escitalopram or another SSRI antidepressant may eventually become part of standard care in the first months after a stroke. First, the findings from this small study need to be confirmed with more research.
Inhaled Steroids Help Few People with COPD
Long-time smokers can develop emphysema, bronchitis or a combination of both. These lung problems are also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD).
Doctors rely on inhalers to keep patients with COPD from having flare-ups in their symptoms. But is this confidence in inhalers over-rated? Yes, say the experts. According to a study published in the February issue of Chest, past studies seem to have overestimated the benefit of corticosteroid inhalers by including primarily patients whose COPD is severe.
Corticosteroid inhalers are meant to reduce inflammation in the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids include the medicines beclomethasone (QVAR), budesonide (Pulmicort), flunisolide (AeroBid), fluticasone (Flovent), mometasone (Asmanex) and triamcinolone (Azmacort). Several combination inhalers also include a corticosteroid drug.
Researchers reviewed over 1,000 separate studies of corticosteroid inhalers. Then they hand-picked 11 studies that met the most rigid criteria for quality. This means they were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and included strict definitions of flare-ups (""exacerbations"") and objective descriptions of lung function.
The researchers combined the data from all 11 studies into one large data pool. This gave them information from about 8,164 people who were treated with corticosteroid inhalers or with a placebo.
According to the results, using the inhalers if you had mild COPD did not seem to change your likelihood of having a flare-up. But if you had severe COPD (defined in this study by having less than 50% of normal airflow as measured by lung function tests) and used corticosteroid inhalers, your risk for being hospitalized due to an exacerbation was cut by 18%. This is a measurable benefit, but it is not dramatic.
Inhaled steroids can lead to yeast infections in the mouth (thrush) and cataracts. They can also increase the risk for bone fractures. For people who have COPD, inhaled steroids also increase the risk for pneumonia.
Quitting smoking and wearing oxygen if you need it can improve survival for people who have COPD. Based on this study, corticosteroid inhalers should probably not be used routinely to prevent COPD flare-ups, unless the condition is severe. When exacerbations do occur, steroids like prednisone may still be the appropriate treatment to help speed recovery of symptoms.
New Blood Sugar Goal (A1C) Is Proposed For Type 2 Diabetes
Treating diabetes to bring blood sugar levels to a normal level can safe lives and prevent complications. But sometimes treatment can make blood sugar levels too low and cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is not healthy.
In fact, a much-discussed study from 2008, called the ACCORD trial, showed that overly aggresive treatment of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes led to a higher premature death rate. In this study, people reduced their blood sugar levels to an average A1C of 6.4%. Doctors use a test called hemoglobin A1C to estimate average blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Subsequent studies have not been able to duplicate these findings. Since 2008, however, many expert groups have recommended an A1C goal of less than 7%.
Now, a new study published in Lancet on February 6 may increase the A1C level that doctors consider safe.
This study reviewed the health records of 48,000 people in the United Kingdom who have type 2 diabetes. The information was part of the General Practice Research Database and covered 22 years — until 2008. All of these individuals were over age 50 and had recently increased their diabetes treatment in an effort to gain tighter control of their blood sugar.
The researchers ranked all 48,000 people by their A1C levels, and then divided them into ten equally-sized groups from ""low"" to ""high"" A1Cs. They reviewed the health outcomes of each patient. The group with the fewest deaths had A1C levels near to 7.5%. The group with the lowest A1C levels (less than 6.7%) had 1.5 more deaths per year than the group with the most ""survivable"" A1C levels — about 7.5%. (There were roughly three deaths in the 6.7% A1C group for every two deaths in the 7.5% group.) People with A1C below 6.7% also had more dangerous ""large artery events,"" which included a heart attack, stroke, chest pain that was blamed on heart disease, heart surgery or angioplasty to open a heart artery or a carotid (neck) artery. For people who had an A1C above 9.8%, the 1-year death rate was 1.79 times greater than that of the ""best"" surviving group. This translates to about nine deaths in the highest A1C group for every fove deaths in the group with an A1C near to 7.5%.
This study also found that people who were treated with a combination of oral medicines (pills) for diabetes seemed to live longer than people who were treated with insulin. It was not clear from this study whether this difference could be blamed on insulin, because the people who used insulin were older and had diabetes for for a longer period of time than the average person in the oral treatment group.
We can probably safely conclude that the ideal A1C for a person with type 2 diabetes is 7.5%, and that levels below 6.7% are unhealthy.
FDA Says to Limit Your Use of Certain Asthma Inhalers
Long-acting beta agonist (LABA) drugs are commonly used inhaled medications that open the airways. They wear off very gradually. Although it is rare, they may increase the chance of one or more severe asthma episodes, which can lead to death. Experts are not sure why this happens to some people. It may be that the medicines cause the lungs to adapt and adjust over time, limiting the power of rescue medicines to treat severe symptoms.
Now, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new restrictions on the use of these inhalers. This follows a series of previous warnings. If you have asthma, do not use one of these inhalers, says the FDA, unless it is packaged with or combined with an asthma ""controller"" medicine. (For most people, this is an inhaled corticosteroid.) A LABA medication, says the FDA, should only be used short-term and stopped as soon as symptoms are under control. The FDA's Drug Safety Communication was posted online on February 18.
LABA medications include salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), and two inhalers that combine a LABA medication with a corticosteroid (Advair diskus, Symbicort). The restrictions are not meant to apply to bronchitis and emphysema, which are also called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Review Looks at Best Drug Treatments for Muscle Cramps
More than half of older adults complain of muscle cramps. Researchers supported by the American Association of Neurology looked at various drug treatments for muscle cramps to identify the best ones. They reported their findings and treatment guidelines in the February 23 issue of Neurology.
Cramps, confirm these experts, are more frequent when a person has a neurologic or muscle disease. They are also common in the third trimester of pregnancy. They frequently occur after heavy exercise or when a person is dehydrated. Cramps can also be caused by low magnesium or calcium, or when the liver, thyroid or kidneys are not working properly.
To treat muscle cramps, doctors usually recommend that you keep hydrated and stretch. These treatments may help some people. For other people, there are drug treatments. But how effective are they? The researchers reviewed more than 500 articles. They chose only high-quality studies to analyze.
They found that taking gabapentin (Neurontin), vitamin E, magnesium citrate or magnesium sulfate had no benefit. However, vitamin B6, diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Cartia XT, Tiazac and other brands) and nafthidrofuryl (nafronyl or Praxil?ne), which is not available currently in the United States, reduced the frequency or severity of cramps.
Quinine drugs, which used to be an old-fashioned favorite among people with cramps, had a modest effect on the frequency of cramps. They reduced them by about 25%, according to the most carefully designed trial. However, the FDA ordered most quinine drugs off the market in 2006 because they were too risky to use for this purpose. Between 1969 and 2006 there were a total of 665 known serious adverse events, including 93 deaths, which were blamed on side effects from quinine drugs.
More News in Brief Stuttering Is Explained By Gene Mutation. Stuttering has sometimes been blamed on stress, nervousness, low intelligence or habit. It often runs in families. But scientists have now identified a clear biologic cause of stuttering: mutations in any of three recently identified genes. These genes could account for about 9% of stuttering cases. Experts anticipate they will find more genes linked to stuttering after more research. It's possible that most cases of stuttering will eventually be linked to a genetic cause. The New England Journal of Medicine published this report on February 10. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Strongly Increases Risk for Clot in Leg. Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) results in chronic inflammation. In recent years, doctors have learned that chronic inflammation can increase a person's tendency to form blood clots. When a blood clot forms in a large vein in the leg, it can cause deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A DVT is dangerous because the clot can dislodge and make its way to the lungs. This problem, called a pulmonary embolus, is life-threatening. Researchers studied 13,756 people with inflammatory bowel disease and 71,672 people who did not have the condition. They recorded the number of DVT events that occurred in each group. During a flare of inflammatory bowel disease — and for four months after — the risk of clotting was 16 times greater for people with IBD than for people without the disease. This study was published online by the Lancet on February 8. In light of the findings, doctors may begin to recommend that people who have Crohn's or ulcerative colitis should take a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin) when they are experiencing or recovering from a flare-up of symptoms.

View Full Version : Boost magnesium levels with epsom salt baths
barbara09-12-2009, 10:42 PMBy Melissa Breyer, Senior Editor, Healthy & Green Living
Many of us are deficient in magnesium, and by simply soaking in a relaxing bath with magnesium-rich Epsom salt we can boost our levels of this important element. ?Magnesium,? you might wonder, ?what?s the big deal?? Find out the importance of magnesium and discover the many surprising health benefits of using Epsom salt in your bath.
We all know about the importance of iron and calcium, but what about magnesium? It is the second-most abundant element in human cells and the fourth-most important positively charged ion in the body. Surprisingly, it helps the body regulate over 325 enzymes and plays an important role in organizing many bodily functions, like muscle control, electrical impulses, energy production and the elimination of harmful toxins.
According to the National Academy of Sciences, most Americans are magnesium deficient, which the academy says helps to account for high rates of heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and joint pain, digestive maladies, stress-related illnesses, chronic fatigue and a number of other ailments. Who knew?!
Americans? magnesium levels have dropped by half in the last century due to changes in agriculture and diet. Industrial farming has depleted magnesium from soil and the typical American diet contains much less magnesium than that of our forefathers. And in fact, the modern American diet with its fat, sugar, salt and protein actually works to speed up the depletion of magnesium from our bodies.
Interestingly, our focus on getting enough calcium is another factor in decreased magnesium levels. In a delicate dance of balance, calcium depletes magnesium yet calcium functions best when enough magnesium is present. Studies indicate that taking a calcium supplement without enough magnesium can increase the shortage of both nutrients. Researchers have found that many Americans have five times as much calcium as magnesium in their bodies, although the proper ratio for optimum absorption of both minerals is two to one.
With such widespread magnesium deficiency one might think that magnesium supplements would be called upon, but studies show that magnesium is not easily absorbed through the digestive tract. The presence of specific foods or drugs, certain medical conditions, and the chemistry of a person?s stomach acid can render magnesium supplements ineffective.
This brings us to Epsom salt. Known scientifically as hydrated magnesium sulfate, Epsom salt is rich in both magnesium and sulfate. While both magnesium and sulfate can be poorly absorbed through the stomach, studies show increased magnesium levels from soaking in a bath enriched with Epsom salt! Magnesium and sulfate are both easily absorbed through the skin. Sulfates play an important role in the formation of brain tissue, joint proteins and the proteins that line the walls of the digestive tract. They stimulate the pancreas to generate digestive enzymes and are thought to help detoxify the body of medicines and environmental contaminants.
Researchers and physicians suggest these health benefits from proper magnesium and sulfate levels, as listed on the web site of the Epsom Salt Industry Council:
* Improved heart and circulatory health, reducing irregular heartbeats, preventing hardening of the arteries, reducing blood clots and lowering blood pressure.
* Improved ability for the body to use insulin, reducing the incidence or severity of diabetes.
* Flushed toxins and heavy metals from the cells, easing muscle pain and helping the body to eliminate harmful substances.
* Improved nerve function by electrolyte regulation. Also, calcium is the main conductor for electrical current in the body, and magnesium is necessary to maintain proper calcium levels in the blood.
* Relieved stress. Excess adrenaline and stress are believed to drain magnesium, a natural stress reliever, from the body. Magnesium is necessary for the body to bind adequate amounts of serotonin, a mood-elevating chemical within the brain that creates a feeling of well being and relaxation.
* Reduced inflammation to relieve pain and muscle cramps.
* Improved oxygen use.
* Improved absorption of nutrients.
* Improved formation of joint proteins, brain tissue and mucin proteins.
* Prevention or easing of migraine headaches.
All this from a bath, hurray! While there are many different brands of Epsom salt, they are all the same product chemically, and can be found at most drug stores. Add two cups of Epsom salt and soak for at least 12 minutes. Do this three times weekly.
If you are pregnant or have any health concerns, check with your doctor before using Epsom salts.

Yes, I agree that Mg is essential for good health!
I buy Mg in pure liquid form(concentrate) and put it in her H20.
Aside from all the benefits you listed, the other important one that it helps a lot, is keeping her ""regular"". This is extremely important for PD patients, as constipation is an enemy for PWP. Also, I occasionally rub her legs with Mg salts(called ancients minerals);-this is usually equivalent in giving her 100mg by mouth.

Cramps in the Leg
Leg cramps are common. The cause is not known
in most cases. However, some drugs and diseases sometimes cause
leg cramps. Regular calf stretching exercises may prevent leg
cramps. Quinine tablets may be advised as a last resort if you
have cramps regularly.
What are leg cramps?
A leg cramp is a pain that comes from a leg muscle. It is due
to a muscle spasm which is when a muscle contracts too hard. It
usually occurs in a calf muscle, below and behind a knee. The
small muscles of the feet are sometimes affected.
A cramp pain typically lasts a few minutes. In some cases it
lasts just seconds, but in some cases it lasts up to 10 minutes.
The severity of the pain varies. The muscle may remain tender
for up to 24 hours after a leg cramp. Leg cramps usually occur
when you are resting - most commonly at night when in bed. (They
are often called night cramps.) They may wake you. It can become
a distressing condition if your sleep is regularly disturbed..
.
Who gets leg cramps?
Many people have an occasional leg cramp. However, they occur
frequently in some people. They are more common in older people.
About 1 in 3 people over the age of 60, and about half of people
over the age of 80, have regular leg cramps. About 4 in 10 people
who have leg cramps have at least three per week. They occur every
day in some people..
.
What causes leg cramps?.
Unknown cause (idiopathic leg cramps)
In most cases the cause is not known. One theory is that cramps
occur when a muscle that is already in a shortened position is
stimulated to contract. As the muscle is already shortened, to
contract further may cause the muscle to go into spasm. This commonly
happens at night in bed, as the natural position we lie in is
with the knees slightly bent (flexed), and with feet pointing
slightly downwards. In this position the calf muscle is relatively
shortened and may be prone to cramps. This theory explains why
stretching exercises may cure the problem..
.
Secondary causes
In some cases, the cramps may be a symptom of another problem.
For example:.
•Some drugs can cause cramps as a side-effect, or make cramps
occur more often. These include: diuretics (water tablets), nifedipine,
cimetidine, salbutamol, statins, terbutaline, lithium, clofibrate,
penicillamine, phenothiazines, and nicotinic acid.
•Over-exertion of muscles.
•Dehydration.
•Conditions that cause alterations in the balance of salts
in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium or potassium
level).
•Some people who have renal (kidney) dialysis get leg cramps.
•Pregnancy - usually in the later stages.
•An untreated underactive thyroid gland.
•Peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of the leg arteries
which causes poor circulation).
•Excess alcohol.
•Some uncommon disorders of nerves.
•Rare causes include: cirrhosis of the liver; lead poisoning;
sarcoidosis.
With the above conditions the cramps would just be one of various
other symptoms. Therefore, if you are otherwise well, and have
no other unexplained symptoms, then the leg cramps are likely
to be idiopathic (unknown cause) and not due to a secondary cause.
Note: leg cramps are different to a condition called restless
legs syndrome. In this condition the legs can be uncomfortable,
you feel creeping sensations in the legs, and it is relieved by
walking about. See separate leaflet called 'Restless Legs Syndrome'
for details..
.
What is the treatment for a leg cramp?
Stretching and massaging the affected muscle can usually relieve
an attack of cramp. Most cramps soon ease off. Painkillers are
not usually helpful as they do not act quickly enough. However,
a painkiller such as paracetamol may help to ease muscle discomfort
and tenderness that sometimes persists for up to 24 hours after
a cramp has gone..
.
What are the options for preventing leg cramps?
If cramps do not occur often, then no particular treatment is
usually needed. However, if you have frequent cramps, you may
wish to consider ways of preventing them..
.
Consider your medication (where appropriate) or other conditions
Tell your doctor if you take any of the drugs listed earlier.
It may be causing the leg cramps, or making them recur more often.
Alternative drugs may be available. Also, if you have other symptoms
apart from cramps, see your doctor who may examine you or do some
checks to rule out a secondary cause for the cramps..
.
Stretching exercises
Stretching exercises are commonly advised. However, there is
a lack of good research evidence to prove that they work. One
research study concluded that stretching exercises did reduce
the number and severity of cramps, but another study did not confirm
this. However, many doctors feel that regular calf stretching
does help. So, as it may help, it is worth trying if you are able
to do the exercises. If it works, you will not need any tablets
to prevent the cramps.
At first, do stretching exercises of affected muscles for about
five minutes, three times a day. Do the last exercise shortly
before bedtime. If the cramps ease off, you may then only need
to do the exercise once or twice a day to keep the cramps away.
To stretch calf muscles, stand about 60-90 cm from a wall. Then,
keeping the soles of your feet flat on the floor, bend forward
and lean on the wall. You will feel your calf muscles stretch.
Do this several times, each time for as long as you can manage.
It may take a week or so of exercises before you notice an improvement.
So, it is worth giving yourself a 2- to 4-week trial of regular
calf stretching exercises to see if your cramps ease off. The
cramps may not go completely, but their frequency and/or severity
may reduce..
.
Posture of the legs when resting in bed
Positions which prevent the calf muscle from shortening when
you are asleep may help. The following are not proven treatments
(from research studies), but some experts believe that they help
to prevent cramps..
•Using a pillow to prop the feet up in bed while sleeping
on your back.
•Hanging the feet over the end of the bed while sleeping
on your front.
•Keeping blankets loose at the foot of the bed to prevent
toes and feet from pointing downwards during sleep.
.
Quinine is used as a last resort - and you need to be aware of
the risks
If you take quinine you have a good chance of reducing the number
and/or severity of leg cramps, but it may not stop them altogether.
One tablet at bedtime is the normal dose. Most people can take
quinine, but do not take it if you are pregnant or may become
pregnant. There are also some rare conditions where you should
not take quinine. These include: a previous reaction to quinine;
a previous haemolytic anaemia; optic neuritis; glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency.
Side-effects are uncommon at the low dose used to treat leg cramps.
However, serious side-effects do sometimes occur. For example,
a serious blood disorder which is potentially fatal is a known
rare side-effect. Also, a small number of people who take quinine
long-term develop a condition called cinchonism (a complex of
nausea, vomiting, dizziness, visual disturbance, and hearing impairment).
Read the drug packet leaflet for a full list of possible side-effects.
Note: quinine is dangerous in overdose, particularly in children.
Keep tablets away from children.
Therefore, quinine is only used as a last resort when other treatments
have not worked, and leg cramps are frequent and are affecting
your quality of life.
When quinine is first prescribed it may be done on a trial basis
for 4-6 weeks. You should be aware of the small risk of serious
side-effects. Also, it is best to objectively assess how well
the quinine works. For example, by keeping a sleep and cramp diary.
Ideally, this should be for a few weeks before and after the start
of treatment so as to gauge its effect. If quinine is found to
help then you may be advised to continue with it for a few months.
You should consider stopping quinine every three months or so
to see if it is still needed. This is because, in some people,
the cramps go away and so the treatment may no longer be needed.
If the cramps return, you can always re-start the tablets..
.
Other treatments
Other drugs have been suggested as possible treatments for leg
cramps. These include: magnesium, diltiazem, vitamin B complex,
vitamin E, naftidrofuryl, orphenadrine, and verapamil. In general,
these are not currently recommended, as most studies involving
them found that they do not work very well in most people. Quinine
remains the main treatment. However, your doctor may suggest a
trial of one of these drugs if quinine has not worked or has caused
troublesome side-effects.

If the body is low in magnesium, it is forced to take it from the muscles, and without sufficient magnesium muscles stiffen up or contract at liberty. The result may be painful cramps, irritability, twitching or even tremors. Magnesium supplementation may also be of assistance for the temporary relief of symptoms of back pain and muscular strain. Features and benefits Combines magnesium with co-factors for improved absorption and utilisation Contains magnesium from two different sources, magnesium oxide (which is the most concentrated source of elemental magnesium) and magnesium phosphateHow it works Magnesium is essential for the electrical activity of nerves and muscle, and is indicated to relieve painful cramps (including menstrual cramps), twitching and tremors. Together with calcium, magnesium plays an integral role in tooth and bone hardness.Other nutrients present in Bio Magnesium also assist muscle function and include vitamins C and D (low intake has been associated with muscle fatigue), vitamin B6 and the mineral manganese which is involved in active phosphate transfer processes to provide muscle energy. Dosage Adults - Take one to two tablets daily with meals, or as professionally prescribed Children (from 6 years to 12 years) - We recommend Blackmores Celloid Magnesium Compound.Children (under 6 years) - Only as professionally prescribed. Cautions This product contains pyridoxine hydrochloride, which may cause peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) when used in large amounts or for a long time. If symptoms persist, see your healthcare professional Always read the label. Use only as directed. Side Effects None noted in the literature at the recommended dosage Active Ingredients Per Tablet Magnesium oxide - heavy 440 mg Magnesium phosphate 175 mg (equiv to total magnesium 300 mg) Calcium ascorbate 250 mg Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine hydrochloride) 50 mg Vitamin D3 (Colecalciferol 2.5 mcg) 100 IU Manganese amino acid chelate 40 mg equivalent to manganese 4 mg Medicine interactions If taking tetracycline or quinolone antibiotics separate doses by at least two hours. Magnesium may decrease the absorption and efficacy of these medications. Consult your healthcare professional before use if taking, or think you may be taking phenytoin or phenobarbitone (anticonvulsant drugs). Pyrodoxine may decrease plasma levels of these medications.

Diapulse�
Electromagnetic Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury, Head Injury, & Pressure
Sores
Laurance Johnston,
Ph.D. & James Kelly
Other articles posted on this website discuss how
electromagnetic energy can treat various ailments relevant to physical
disability. This article specifically discusses the use of Diapulse,
a device that directs a pulsed-electromagnetic field (PEMF) to an area of
injury. Animal and human studies indicate that this treatment soon after
spinal cord injury (SCI) protects neurons, promotes regeneration, and
minimizes lost function.
The
therapy has been also proven to reduce cerebral edema and mortality after
traumatic head injury and accelerate the healing of disability-associated
pressure sores.
Modern medicine focuses on the anatomical and
biochemical (i.e., the physical), ignoring, until recently, the body�s
less-understood electromagnetic nature. As underscored by Albert
Einstein�s famous E= mc2 equation, however, the physical never
exists without energy, and each influences the other. Every molecule in
our body emits an electromagnetic field, and because each cell - and, in
turn, each organ - is an aggregation of such molecules, they too are
electromagnetic.
There is no tissue in which this fact is more evident
than our nervous system, which functions by routing electromagnetic
impulses throughout our body via our spinal cord. Hence, attempts to fix
an injured cord through physical means will be enhanced by working with
and - not against - its electromagnetic nature.
DESCRIPTION:
Diapulse
directs electromagnetic energy to a specific
body area, even through clothing, casts, or bandages, via
a cylindrical treatment head mounted on an adjustable bracket. The
technology does not cause side effects or require patient
involvement.
Because the device
pulses its electromagnetic output, it emits energy for only a fraction of
time, allowing any heat associated with the transferred energy to
dissipate. Diapulse�s electromagnetic output is often pulsed at 600 pulses
per second with each pulse lasting 65 microseconds (1 second = 1million
microseconds). Hence, this pulse rate corresponds to the device being off
25 times longer than it is on.
HISTORY:
The Diapulse prototype
was developed in the early 1930s by physician Abraham Ginsberg and
physicist Arthur Milinowski, who reported their initial
clinical experience and animal research with the device to the 1934 & 1940
New York Academy of Medicine. Because the technology behind the device was
used to develop radar, the device�s emergence as a healing modality was
delayed due to World War II security concerns.
Research was resumed in
the 1950s by the military�s Tri-Service Research Program, which after
extensive studies concluded that the device was safe and effective.
About this time, the driving force behind Diapulse
shifted from Ginsburg to Dr. Jesse Ross, a biophysicist, whose impressive
background includes professional associations with Einstein and being one
of the founders of the prestigious Bioelectromagnetic Society and a NASA
consultant. Ross created the Diapulse Corporation of America (Great Neck,
NY), developing a collaboration with Remington Rand to produce the device.
To further assess the device�s healing potential, Ross then launched
ambitious research with universities and clinicians around the world.
One famous customer was former President Harry
Truman, who rented the device in 1966.
Over time, Diapulse was adopted as a treatment in
various areas of medicine throughout the world; in this country, it is
approved by the FDA for treatment of post-operative swelling and pain.
DIAPULSE STUDIES:
Numerous studies support Diapulse�s potential to
treat neurologically associated problems and exert neuroprotective and
-regenerative influences. After nervous-system injury, Diapulse helps to
restore the membrane potential (concentration difference of charged
solutes between the cell inside and outside) necessary to ensure cell
survival and to enhance recovery-promoting blood flow.
Blood Flow:
Dr. W. Erdman
(Philadelphia, 1960) demonstrated that Diapulse increases systemic blood
flow without elevating pulse rate or blood pressure. This effect is most
likely due to the ability of Diapulse-generated fields to induce cells to
align in a pearl-chain fashion. When the device was turned off, the cells
reassumed a random distribution. With such a pearl-chain alignment, blood
cells can more efficiently pass through a given vascular space, like cars
traveling in the same direction on parallel lanes instead of �bumper�
cars.
As in all injuries, the
rate of blood flow affects recovery after SCI. Specifically, the injury to
the cord compromises blood flow, which, as a consequence, aggravates
neurological damage. The importance of this issue was emphasized in a
recent SCI conference where Dr. H. Crock (London, UK), probably the
world�s foremost expert on spinal cord circulation, stressed that blood
flow is the primary factor that needs to be addressed after SCI (insert
link). Given Diapulse�s ability to enhance blood-flow, it is not
surprising that studies indicate that it promotes healing after SCI.
Animal Studies:
The first scientists to
focus on Diapulse�s neuronal regeneration properties were Drs. D. Wilson
and P. Jagadeesh (Leeds, UK, 1975). After demonstrating that the device
stimulates regeneration in rats with peripheral nerve injuries (i.e.,
those outside of the brain and spinal cord), they examined its effects on
cats whose spinal cords were half cut (hemicordotomy). Three months after
hemicordotomy, compared to controls, Diapulse improved functional
recovery, reduced scar formation and adhesions, increased the number of
axons transversing the injury site, and promoted the integration of
peripheral nerve grafts that had been inserted to bridge the lesion.
Drs. A. Raji and R.
Bowden (London, UK, 1983) also demonstrated that Diapulse enhances
regeneration and remyelination of rat peripheral nerves after transection.
Because surgeons are
beginning to use peripheral nerve tissue to bridge spinal cord lesions in
human, Diapulse�s ability to accelerate regeneration in peripheral tissue
also has important therapeutic implications for SCI.
Dr. Wise Young (New
York, 1984) showed that Diapulse reduces calcium at the injury site in
cats injured through impact, (an injury that resembles most human SCI).
Because calcium causes secondary neuronal cell death, this
Diapulse-induced reduction lessened neurological damage and, in turn,
preserved function.
Specifically, Young
reported that 1) the majority of Diapulse-treated cats were walking four
months after surgery compared to none in the control group and 2) that the
device was superior to treatment with the steroid methylprednisolone, now
considered a post-injury treatment standard.
SCI Human Studies:
Dr. M. Weiss, et al (Warsaw, Poland) carried out a
promising SCI study in 1980. Weiss, who interestingly was funded by the
U.S. Veterans Administration for developing another innovative SCI
approach, arranged for acutely injured patients to be picked up by
helicopter and brought to Warsaw where they were treated with Diapulse. Of
the 97 treated patients, 38 had pronounced neurological improvement; of
these, 28 had substantial functional gains, and 18 were discharged with
only slight impairment of the extremities. Although
this preliminary study lacked
controls, these are impressive statistics, which, at minimum, warrant
study replication. Unfortunately, because Weiss died soon after publishing
these initial results, combined with post-communism social upheaval, this
promising research was not continued.
Dr. W. Ellis (1987)
anecdotally noted that PEMF given for pain in patients with chronic SCI
resulted in sensory or motor improvement in 7 of 13 patients. Ellis
hypothesized that these fields can normalize viable but dysfunctional
neuronal structures.
In another posted article, a surgical procedure was
discussed in which olfactory tissue was transplanted into the injury site
of individuals with chronic SCI to restore function. Working with the lead
surgeon Dr. C. Lima (Portugal), Ross treated two Americans with
quadriplegia with Diapulse several days before and after surgery to
promote neuronal regeneration.
Head Injury:
In large clinical
trials, Dr. M. Sambasivan (India, 1993) showed that Diapulse therapy
reduces cerebral edema and mortality after traumatic-brain-injury.
SCI Pressure Sores:
In 1991, the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association
gave several Diapulse devices to a nearby VA hospital to treat
SCI-associated pressure sores, and, in turn, funded
a double-blind study by Dr. C. A.
Salzberg et al (Valhalla, NY, 1995) which showed
that Diapulse-treated patients with such sores healed on average in 13
compared to 31.5 days for controls. (See
testimonial letter below)
CONCLUSION:
Compelling evidence indicates that Diapulse-generated
pulsed electromagnetic fields exert neuroprotective and -regenerative
influences when administered soon after SCI. Although its true SCI
therapeutic potential still needs to be determined, if Diapulse
represented a more familiar pharmaceutical approach, the biomedical
research community would be elated given this amount of positive
preliminary evidence and pushing it to the forefront for further scrutiny
instead of letting it languish on the sidelines. Our neglect may have
adversely affected the many of those currently living with SCI. For the
sake of all those who sustain a SCI in the future, let�s once and for all
objectively evaluate its healing potential.

TESTIMONIAL
I was delighted to
see the article in this month's PVA. My husband was a T8 para. In
1996 while living in the Minneapolis, MN area, he developed a severe
decubitius ulcer of the coccyx, and it progressed to stage 4 (into the
bone) before anything much was done about it.
We moved to Arizona,
and he had home health care for almost three years, yet the wound
continued. Health care professionals took the approach of packing and
probing with no success. Finally, a new wound care specialist took
time to do a lot of research and came up with the idea of using the
Diapulse. Medicare refused to fund the cost, but our supplement paid
the cost of $98.00 per day for eight weeks. The wound was
approximately 4 centimeters deep and quite large in diameter. It was
absolutely amazing, after eight weeks of 4 times a day, the wound
healed completely. My husband did not experience another wound until
his last hospitalization in Sept. of 2002.
I found it astonishing that none of the doctors or plastic surgeons
had ever heard of this product. In fact my husband was at Mayo
Hospital Clinic in Phoenix, and I discussed it with the health care
personnel there and they had never heard of it either. Diapulse needs
to do some sweeping advertising to the medical field, as it is indeed
a miracle cure for bedsores!!!
Sincerely,
Anna

Introduction
When will a cure for spinal cord injury be available? This is the second most frequently asked question, usually asked right after the first most frequently asked question, “Will there be a cure for spinal cord injury?” While I don’t have a crystal ball for the future, some therapies are already beginning to restore function in people with spinal cord injury with spinal cord injury, several regenerative therapies have begun clinical trials, and the first combination therapies will soon go into clinical trial. If we work hard, the resources are available, and we are lucky, we should expect the first restorative therapies within 5 years and perhaps the first curative combination therapies within a decade.
First generation therapies for spinal cord injury are already restoring some function to some people with spinal cord injury. Methylprednisolone (MP) was the first therapy to show any beneficial effects when given after spinal cord injury. MP improves motor and sensory recovery by about 20% compared to control. A second therapy is Fampridine (4-aminopyridine), which is restoring function to some people with demyelination. The third therapy is locomotor training for people with “incomplete” spinal cord injuries.
Second generation therapies are now or will soon be in clinical trial. These include cell transplants (olfactory ensheathing glia, Schwann cells, bone marrow stem cells, neural stem cells, oligodendroglial progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells), nogo and nogo receptor blockers, chondroitinase, growth factors, lithium, and many others. These therapies are likely to stimulate modest regeneration in the spinal cord and restore more function to more people.
Third generation therapies will be combination therapies that will bring substantially more function to most people, fulfilling the definition of what many people may call “cures” for spinal cord injury. The optimal combination will probably differ depending on the individual. The combination therapies should include not only therapies that regenerate spinal axons but also remyelination and neuronal replacement, including motoneurons.
What can we learn from these experiences? I will describe below eight examples of therapies for spinal cord injury, i.e. methyprednisolone, locomotor training, fampridine, cethrin, nogo antibody, and human embryonic stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, and combination therapy with cord blood mononuclear cells and lithium. I chose these treatments because each have undergone or are going through clinical trial. I will describe the development of each of the therapies to date, the lessons from this experience, and the probability of the first restorative therapies and combination therapies.
Methylprednisolone (MP)
MP was the first therapy shown to be effective for acute spinal cord injury. In the 1970’s, neurosurgeons were using high doses of the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid drug methylprednisolone (MP) to treat arachnoiditis [1] and head injury [2]. Some clinicians wondered if MP would be effective for acute spinal cord injury [3, 4]. In 1979, ten spinal cord injury centers joined to do the first double blind randomized clinical trial of high-dose and low-dose MP for acute spinal cord injury.
The first National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS 1) randomized 300 patients to 1000 mg/day or 100 mg/day of intravenous MP for 10 days starting within 24 hours after injury. The trial found no significant difference between the two doses of MP [5]. However, in 1982, animal studies showed that much higher doses (30 mg/kg) were required to inhibit lipid peroxidation [6] and that very early treatment was necessary for to reduce extracellular calcium entry into cells and to prevent post-traumatic ischemia [7]. The opiate receptor blocker naloxone was beneficial in animal models [8, 9] and a phase 2 trial [10].
The second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS 2) therefore randomized 487 patients to placebo, high-dose MP (30 mg/kg bolus followed by 5.4 mg/kg/hour over 24 hours), and naloxone (5.4 mg/kg + 3.0 mg/kg/hour over 24 hours). Starting in 1985, the trial proposed to segregate patients by the median treatment time, which was 8 hours, assess the effects of treatment timing. NASCIS 2 [11] showed that high-dose MP improved motor and sensory recovery compared to placebo when treatment started within 8 hours but not when started later than 8 hours [12]. Naloxone had intermediate effects between MP and placebo. MP was not associated with significant morbidity or mortality. From 1991-1993, <50% of people with acute spinal cord injury in Colorado received MP [13] and physicians tended to give the drug to more severely injured patients.
The third National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS 3) randomized 499 patients with acute spinal cord injury and treated all within 8 hours with a 30 mg/kg MP bolus, followed by 5.4 mg/kg/hour for 24 hours (MP24), MP given for 48 hours (MP48), or tirilazad mesylate (TM) 2.5 mg bolus given every 6 hours for 48 hours (TM48). The median treatment time was 3 hours. All three treatment groups had similar outcomes when started within 3 hours but MP48 was better than either MP24 or TM48 when given more than 3 hours after injury [14, 15]. The treatments were not associated with significant mortality or morbidity except for an increase in severe pneumonia after MP48.
The NASCIS group recommended MP24 when it could be started within 3 hours, MP48 between 3-8 hours, and no MP if it could not be started within 8 hours after injury. Several randomized trials [16-19] have confirmed beneficial effects and safety of MP use in human acute spinal cord injury and related conditions [20, 21]. However, one small randomized trial [22] and several retrospective studies [23-27] suggested MP may be ineffective. One study suggested that MP Retrospective studies are biased because clinicians tend to give MP to more severely injured patients. Nevertheless, criticisms of NASCIS mounted [28-36]. Today, MP is an option and not a standard treatment of acute spinal cord injury in the United States.
Locomotor Training
Most doctors believe that recovery of walking is unlikely after spinal cord injury and thus few encourage their patients to walk after injury. In 1992, Wernig & Muller [37] reported that intensive treadmill training restored unassisted walking to 8 patients, starting at 5-20 months after spinal cord injury. By 1995, Wernig et al. [38] had studied 89 patients (44 chronic, 45 acute) with spinal cord injury. Of 44 chronic patients trained for 3-20 weeks, 33 were initially wheelchair-bound and could not stand or walk. After training, 25 (76%) of the 33 wheelchair-bound patients achieved unassisted walking. Of 11 patients who were walking before training, all had better speed and endurance. In a 1998 followup [39], at 6-72 months after training, 31 of 35 chronic patients who recovered unassisted walking maintained, three improved, and one stopped walking. Of 41 initially acute spinal cord injuries, 15 improved and one stopped walking.
In 1998, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) commissioned a multicenter study to compare weight-supported treadmill and overground walking training in spinal cord injury. The Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial or SCILT [40] showed that <10% of patients with ASIA B, 92% of those with ASIA C, and 100% of ASIA D recovered walking at >0.8 meter/second and over 260 meters in 6 minutes. An ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) B classification refers to an injury that preserves only sensation below the injury site, including anal sensation. ASIA C indicate injuries that preserve anal sensation or sphincter function and motor function below the injury site but less than half of ten key muscles have strength grades exceeding 3 of 5 (0=paralyzed, 1=slight, 2=definite, 3=anti-gravity, 4=against resistance, 5=normal). ASIA D indicates injuries with 5 or more key muscles with strength grades of 3 or more. SCILT indicated no difference between training with weight-supported treadmill and overground walking.
Although intensive training can restore locomotion in animals after even severe spinal cord injuries [41-45], the finding that >90% of people with incomplete spinal cord injury can recover unassisted walking even without treadmill training nonetheless took many clinicians by surprise. Despite initial resistance, this finding is transforming rehabilitation of spinal cord injury. Motor incomplete patients can walk. Many investigators are now examining the effects of treadmill training patients with ASIA A (complete) or B (sensory incomplete). Others are assessing other training approaches, in combination with functional electrical stimulation [46], serotonin receptor agonists [47], and other methods of increasing motor control [48].
In summary, early studies in the 1990’s reported that weight-supported treadmill training could restore unassisted locomotion to people with chronic spinal cord injury. In 1998, the NIH funded SCILT to study weight-supported treadmill training of patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries. The study surprisingly showed that >90% of motor incomplete patients recovered unassisted locomotion, whether they were trained by treadmill or overground walking, suggesting that most people who have preserved motor function after injury can recover locomotion if they worked on it. Many investigators are examining various adjuncts to locomotor training.
Fampridine (4-AP)
Trauma, ischemia, and inflammation demyelinate the spinal cord. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP or fampridine) blocks potassium channels on demyelinated axons, improves conduction, and increases neurotransmitter release [49]. In 1981, Bostock, et al. [50] reported that 4-AP improves conduction in demyelinated axons and Zangger, et al. [51] showed that it also facilitates L-DOPA induced spinal locomotor rhythms in spinal-injured animals. In 1986, Eliasson, et al. [52] showed that 4-AP restores conduction in heat-injured nerve and spinal roots in animals. In 1987, Bowe, et al. [53] confirmed that 4-AP improves conduction in demyelinated axons and Blight & Gruner [54] found that 4-AP improved vestibulospinal free fall responses in spinal-injured cats. In 1989, Blight et al. studied the effects of 4-AP in dogs [55] and proposed clinical trials of 4-AP in spinal cord injury.
In 1993, Hansebout, et al. [56] did the a double-blind, crossover trial of 4-AP in eight patients, finding the drug improved motor and sensory function. Hayes, et al. [57] confirmed the 4-AP effects on function [58] and motor evoked potentials [59] in patients with spinal cord injury. In 1997, Segal & Brunnemann [60] found that 4-AP improves pulmonary function in quadriplegic humans with chronic spinal cord injury [60]. In 1997, Acorda Therapeutics licensed the use patent for 4-AP treatment of spinal cord injury. In 1998, Potter, et al. [61] did a randomized crossover trial of a sustained release 4-AP (Fampridine SR) made by Elan. In 1999, Acorda partnered with Elan to develop Fampridine SR, including preclinical studies [62, 63], studies to assess pharmacokinetics of intravenous [64], intrathecal [65], oral [66] 4AP in humans and animals [67].
In 2001, van der Bruggen, et al. [68] found that 4-AP (0.5 mg/kg) did not improve neurological function of 20 patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury. However, 4-AP improved motor evoked potentials patients with chronic spinal cord injury [69] and Grijalva, et al. [70] randomized 27 patients to 4-AP or placebo, and found that 30 mg/day 4AP for 12 weeks improved neurological function in 69% compared to 46% on placebo. In 2004, Deforge, et al. [71] found no difference between 4-AP (40 mg/day) or placebo in 15 people who were walking after spinal cord injury.
From 2005 to 2007, after a phase 2 [72], more pharmacokinetics [73, 74] and safety trials [75], Acorda did two large randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trials involving over 800 patients with chronic spinal cord injury to assess Fampridine SR effects on spasticity. Both trials [not yet published] showed no significant difference between Fampridine SR and placebo. However, Acorda also did two phase 3 clinical trials that showed that Fampridine SR significantly improves walking performance in multiple sclerosis (MS).
In summary, over a decade of clinical trials yielded promising and conflicting results concerning 4-AP effects on chronic spinal cord injury. The trials surprisingly revealed that people with spinal cord injury are susceptible to placebo. Over 40% of patients responded to placebo and perhaps half of the patients responded to 4-AP. Until better outcome measures can be found, it may be better to choose a condition that is more responsive to 4-AP and go back later to demonstrate efficacy for spinal cord injury.
Nogo-A Antibody
In 1990, Schwab, et al. stunned the world with his study showing that IN-1, an antibody against an as-yet-unidentified myelin component [76], stimulates regeneration of rat corticospinal tract [77]. The first demonstration of a treatment that regenerates the spinal cord, the work convinced many neuroscientists that Aguayo and David [78-80] were right in their proposal that there is something about central myelin that stops axonal growth. Unfortunately, the IN-1 antibody was promiscuous and bound to many proteins. It took ten years before Schwab and his colleagues were able to isolate and clone the gene for the protein, now named Nogo [81-86]. With the purified protein finally available, Novartis licensed the patent for Nogo antibody treatment of spinal cord injury and embarked on an intensive program to develop the first regenerative therapy for spinal cord injury.
Many investigators tried different approaches to using the discovery of myelin-based growth inhibitory proteins to regenerate the spinal cord injury. For example, Huang, et al. [87] reported that vaccinating mice with spinal cord may have induced antibodies that stimulated spinal cord regeneration, an approach that was later validated when the nogo protein itself was available to determine whether the vaccination induced the antibodies against nogo [88, 89]. If vaccination will induce antibodies that can stimulate spinal cord regeneration, this would be a very powerful approach indeed.
Novartis developed specific nogo-A antibodies that improve behavioral outcome and corticospinal plasticity in rats after experimental stroke [90], stimulated corticospinal regeneration in marmosets [91], increased plasticity in many different preparations [92-94]. After demonstrating that the antibodies penetrated into the spinal cord when infused intrathecally [95] and showing that the anti-Nogo-A antibody stimulated sprouting of corticospinal axons in macaque monkeys [96] and the treatment restores serotonin projections in rats after spinal cord injury [97], the Nogo-A antibody was taken to clinical trial in patients with chronic spinal cord injury.
The Novartis phase 1 trial of Nogo-A-antibody (ATI355) was recently completed. The phase 1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00406016) was an open-label multicenter study to assess feasibility, safety, and tolerability of continuous infusing five doses of ATI355 intrathecally into patients starting 4-14 days after injury. Paraplegic and ASIA A tetraplegic patients were included. Tetraplegic patients who require artificial respiration could receive treatment as late as 60 days after injury, as soon as they were weaned off the respirator. Patient with complete anatomical transection or obstruction of the spinal canal, multiple spinal cord lesions, cauda equina injury, brachial or lumbar plexus injury, significant head injury and systemic disease were excluded. A phase 2 trial has started, indicating that the phase 1 trial has shown safety and feasibility.
In summary, the development of the Nogo antibody has taken nearly 2 decades since the initial discovery that that something in myelin inhibits spinal axonal regeneration. The treatment has been validated in many laboratory studies and completed phase 1, indicating feasibility and safety. Upcoming phase 2 trials will optimize the therapy and outcome measures, to be followed by pivotal phase 3 studies to show efficacy.
Cethrin
In 2001, Strittmatter et al. [98-107] described the receptor for Nogo. The receptor, like many others that stop axonal growth and cellular migration, inhibits axonal growth by activating the intracellular messenger rho with rho kinase [108]. The Strittmatter laboratory identified a 66-amino acid fragment of Nogo that blocks the Nogo receptor [109-112] and other Nogo receptor blockers [113-124]. They even showed that MP and Nogo-66 have a synergistic effect on regeneration [125]. Working with Biogen, they subsequently found that the soluble Nogo receptor protein itself tightly bind molecules that inhibit axonal growth [123] and improves recovery after spinal cord contusion [126].
In the meantime, after studies of rho activation patterns in the spinal cord [127], Lisa McKerracher proposed [128] a new approach to target rho to stimulate repair and regeneration after spinal cord injury. She used the bacterial toxin C3 to inhibit rho, modifying it so that it entered cells. She formed the company Bioaxone to develop the drug. The resulting cell-permeable recombinant protein BA-210 prevented secondary damage and promoted function recovery in spinal cord injury [129]. BA-210 or Cethrin subsequently went to phase 1 clinical trial [130, 131]. Bioaxone was recently bought be Alseres Pharmaceuticals (formerly Boston Life Sciences).
The Cethrin trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00500812) was a Phase I/IIa dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BA-210 and the neurological status of patients following administration of a single extradural application of Cethrin during surgery for acute thoracic and cervical Spinal Cord Injury. All the patients were ASIA A (complete). Carried out from February 2005 to October 2008, the final data collection of the trial will be in June 2009. The trial compared 0.3, 1, 6, and 9 mg of BA-210 applied to the dura surface of the injured spinal cord, during surgery that exposed the spinal cord for decompression.
Presentations of the Cethrin phase 1 trial results suggest possible beneficial effects of Cethrin in recovery after spinal cord injury [132]. Of 37 patients entered into the trial, they found no serious adverse side effects. All the patients were ASIA A on admission. The six-month patient data indicated that 28% of the patients (10 of 36) improved by one or more ASIA grades as compared to reported literature results of 6.7% [133]. Five of the patients improved to ASIA C and two improved to ASIA D. One patient died form acute respiratory distress syndrome.
A phase 2 trial will start soon to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cethrin in adult subjects with acute cervical spinal cord injury [134]. The trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study that will use mean ASIA motor score change as the primary outcome measure. Six experimental groups will be compared: placebo, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, and 18 mg Cethrin. All the treatments will be applied epidurally during surgery exposing the spinal cord for decompressive or other purposes during the first several weeks after spinal cord injury.
Olfactory Ensheathing Glia (OEG)
The olfactory nerve is the only part in the central nervous system that continuously regenerates in adult mammals. Its regenerative ability has been attributed to olfactory ensheathing glial (OEG) cells that are born in the nasal mucosa and migrate to the olfactory bulb. Doucette [135] suggested that OEG cells would facilitate regeneration in other parts of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord. In 1996, Smale, et al. [136] used OEG cells to repair transected fornix in the rat. In 1997, Li, et al. [137] used OEG cells to repair adult rat corticospinal tract. In 1998, Ramon-Cueto, et al. [138] reported that OEG transplants promoted regeneration in transected rat spinal cords.
In 2000, Barnett, et al. [139, 140] reported that human OEG cells can remyelinate axons. Imaizumi, et al. [141, 142] used pig OEG cells to promote regeneration and remyelination in the spinal cord. Ramon-Cueto, et al. [143, 144] reported functional regeneration in rats after spinal cord transection. Many investigators enthused about the promise of OEG cells to bridge the gap in spinal cord injury [145-151]. One company (Alexion) grew OEG from genetically modified pigs as a substitute for human cells.
In 2001, Lu, et al. [152] reported that transplantation of nasal olfactory tissue promotes partial recovery in paraplegic adult rats. Shortly thereafter, in Portugal, Lima, et al. [153] began transplanting nasal mucosa into patients with chronic spinal cord injury and reported recovery of motor scores, as well as light touch and pinprick scores. In total he transplanted nasal mucosa to over 160 patients with chronic spinal cord injury. Several places, including Osaka University Medical School [154], want to continue the study.
In Brisbane, MacKay-Sim, et al. [155] successfully cultivated olfactory ensheathing cells from the nasal mucosa of 3 patients with chronic spinal cord injury and transplanted the cells into their spinal cords, Compared with 3 patients matched for injury severity and other characteristics, the transplanted patients showed no adverse effects of the transplants. However, they also did not show any significant functional change or neuropathic pain at 3 years after the transplant.
In the largest published series to date, Huang, et al. [156] transplanted OEG isolated from olfactory bulbs of aborted fetuses into 171 patients with chronic spinal cord injury. The patients showed significant increases in sensory scores but only modest improvements in motor function. Dobkin, et al. [157] criticized the study, claiming that there were unreported complications and five patients did not show improvements. Huang has denied these criticisms and published further studies suggesting that OEG transplants are safe and efficacious [158, 159]. He has transplanted OEG into over 1200 patients to date.
In summary, the discovery that OEG cells facilitate regeneration in animal spinal cords excited clinicians. Carlos Lima in Portugal transplanted autologous nasal mucosa into over 160 patients with chronic spinal cord injury with modest results. McKay-Sim in Brisbane cultured nasal mucosa OEG cells and transplanted them into 3 patients who had no significant beneficial effects after 3 year. Huang Beijing transplanted fetal OEG cells into more than 700 patients and find that they consistently restore significant sensory.
Human Embryonic Stem (HES) Cells
The 1977 disovery by Thomson, et al. [160] that pluripotent human embryonic stem (HES) cells can be isolated and cultivated indefinitely transformed stem cell research. The first study reporting efficacy of embryonic stem cells for spinal cord injury appeared in 1999 [172]. While several other cell transplants have reported to be beneficial for spinal cord injury, i.e. marrow stromal cells [162], fetal neural stem cells [163], and other cells [164-171], people thought that the only way to get cells for transplantation was to collect them from fetuses, blood, or bone marrow. HES cells can produce many cell types for transplants, including neural stem cells, which in turn can produce neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendroglia [161].
Geron helped fund the early work leading to the first successful cultivation of HES cells. Working with Keirstead at UC Irvine [173-177], Geron has concentrated their attention on treating spinal cord injury with oligodendroglial progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells [178-180]. However, after many announcements of clinical trials since 2005 [181], the first phase 1 trial of HES cells has not yet been approved by the FDA.
Many people assumed that the delays are due to opposition by the Bush Administration to clinical trials of HES cells in the United States, including a May 2008 hold by the FDA [182]. Some scientists are concerned that the first clinical trial of HES must be very carefully designed. As Evan Snyder of the Burnham Institute pointed out, “The last thing we need is another Jesse Gelsinger, referring to the 18-year-old man who died during a gene therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania in 1999. After Gelsinger’s death, the FDA closed down many gene-therapy trials for several years. Because it is the first time that human embryonic stem cells are being transplanted into human, the trial will be under a microscope and any adverse effect will be emphasized [183].
In statements to the public [184], Geron CEO Thomas Okarma has suggested that the company plans to study 40 people with acute spinal cord injury. The trial will focus on patients who are “complete” (ASIA A) and within the first two weeks after injury. It is not clear whether and how much immunosuppression will be used. Geron scientists have reported that oligodendroglial cells differentiated from HES cells are not targets of innate and adaptive human effectors cells and are resistant to lysis by Neu5Gc antibodies [179]. However, Keirstead has suggeted that long-term immunosuppression may be necessary.
In summary, human embryonic stem cells have been the object of much hope and controversy. Due to their pluripotency, many regard the cells to be a promising source of cells for transplantation. Geron is one of the first companies to fund research leading to the first successful cultivation of human embryonic stem cells a decade ago. The cells have not yet reached clinical trial stage. Geron chose to focus on spinal cord injury in their first clinical trials. However, since 2005, despite repeated announcements, the first phase 1 trials have not yet been approved by the FDA. The trial will likely study 40 patients with subacute spinal cord injury with oligodendroglial cells differentiated from a human embryonic stem cell line. A major question is immune rejection of the cells and whether immunosuppression will be used.
Combination Therapies
Combination therapies achieve greater axonal growth than individual therapies [185]. To regenerate the spinal cord, therapies must address the following obstacles to regeneration.
Bridging the injury site. The spinal cord injury site does not support regenerating axons for several reasons. The injury site is disorganized, filled with inflammatory cells, lacks cellular adhesion molecules to guide axonal growth, and may contain factors the inhibit axonal growth. Many laboratories are consequently transplanting cells or placing biomaterials to provide a bridge for axonal growth across the injury site.
Sustained source of growth factors. Axons grow slowly, less than a mm a day. They must grow long distances, as much as a meter, to reach their original targets. To do so, there must be a sustained source of growth factors. Several neurotrophins, including NGF, NT-3, and GDNF are critical growth factors. One way is to infuse the factors but a better way may be to stimulate either endogenous or transplanted cells to secrete growth factors.
Blocking growth inhibitors. Several factors block axonal growth in the spinal cord. The best defined is the myelin-based factor Nogo. Other include extracellular glycoproteins such as CSPG. The former can be blocked by anti-Nogo-A antibodies, Nogo receptor blockers, rho inhibitors, and even soluble nogo receptor protein. The latter can be digested by enzymes, including chondroitinase.
Individual therapies are being tested in clinical trials. To test combination therapies, we must have clinical trial networks that can test therapies rigorously and efficiently. We have set up a clinical trial network to test spinal cord injury therapies in China. Called the China Spinal Cord Injury Network (ChinaSCINet), this network currently has 25 centers in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, capable of randomizing many thousands of subjects per year.
ChinaSCINet is carrying out the first clinical trials of combination therapies of spinal cord injury, i.e. umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCBMC) and lithium. Many laboratories have reported beneficial effects of UCBMC on spinal cord injury [165-168, 170, 171, 186-188]. In 2004, Yick, et al. [189] reported that lithium stimulates regeneration in rat spinal cord. Subsequently, Su, et al. [190] found that lithium stimulates proliferation of neural stem cells in the spinal cord and Dill, et al. [191] showed that lithium promotes axon regeneration and recovery in rat spinal cord injury.
Lithium stimulates UCBMC cells to secrete NGF, NT-3, and GNDF and we therefore propose to carry out studies of lithium and UCBMC cells individually, in combination, and then with axonal growth inhibitor blockers such as anti-nogo-A antibody, nogo receptor protein, cethrin, and chondroitinase. UCBMC and lithium are attractive first therapies for clinical trial since both have been extensively used in humans for many years. If UCBMC are effective, many cord blood banks are available to supply the cells. Lithium is very low cost and can be taken orally.
Lessons Learned
What lessons have we learned from the above therapies for spinal cord injury? Three lessons are clear:
Slow and Tortuous Process. Few therapies go through the development gauntlet without major hitches. The average time for therapy development exceeded a decade for all therapies described above. For example, development of MP required 13 years (1977 to 1990) from first preclinical discovery to NASCIS 2. Weight-supported treadmill locomotor training required 14 years (1991-2005). Fampridine (1987-now) and Nogo-A antibody (1990-now) both are likely to take over 20 years to develop. The development of Cethrin began in 2003 and may complete clinical trials before 2013. OEG (1997-now) and embryonic stem cells (1997-now) both have taken over a decade already.
Rigorous proof-of-concept of treatment efficacy is required for companies, government, or foundations to invest millions of dollars into development of a therapy. In the case of companies, intellectual property protection is also necessary. A large part of the development time for most of the therapies resulted from a prolonged period of research to establish proof-of-concept. In certain cases, e.g. MP and locomotor training, the clinical trials and proof-of-concept research in animals proceeded in parallel. However, both fampridine and nogo antibody therapies went through 10 years of extensive preclinical studies before the drugs was licensed.
Clinical Trials are Inherently Risky. A single mistake in clinical trial design can set a program by five or more years. It is important to have systematic preclinical data before starting clinical trials. For example, NASCIS 1 compared a ten-day course of 1000 mg/day and 100 mg/day without sufficient animal to indicate the optimal dose or timing of therapy, wasting over 5 years. A wrong choice of outcome measures, such as the choice of spasticity as the primary outcome of the Fampridine trials added over five years to the development of fampridine for spinal cord injury. Neither OEG nor HES cells have undergone any controlled clinical trials.
The development times for spinal cord injury therapies may have been particularly long because all of the therapies are the first in their class. For example, MP was the first neuroprotective drug, weight-supported locomotor training the first major restorative rehabilitation treatment, fampridine was the first conduction enhancing drug, nogo antibody and cethrin are the first regenerative therapies, and OEG and HES transplants are both first of their class. Trailblazing is inherently time-consuming.
Clinical trial networks should reduce treatment development times because much time and expense of clinical trials must be spent on recruiting and train clinical trial centers. Having clinical trial networks that are ready and able to test therapies will not only improve the quality of clinical trials but should speed up and defray costs significantly. This will encourage companies to invest in spinal cord injury therapies.
Probability
How soon can we expect curative therapies of spinal cord injury? To date, most spinal cord injury therapies have taken 10-20 years to complete clinical trials. Establishment of clinical trial networks and increased interest of pharmaceutical companies in spinal cord injury therapies may shorten the development time. However, until significant new funding becomes available for spinal cord injury clinical trials, the rate of progress in developing therapies is unlikely to change significantly.
Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch and several promising therapies are already in the clinical trial pipeline. Six of the 8 therapies described above are in or soon will be in clinical trials. If each therapy has a 50% chance of success, we would have to be rather unlucky for all the trials will fail. In the case of 6 trials, the probability of all six trials failing is 1 in 64. Clearly, it behooves us to have as many clinical trials going in parallel as possible. The reason is that if one trial is successful, everybody wins.
The likelihood that a given clinical trial will be successful of course depends on the therapy and the amount of data supporting that particular therapy and clinical trial design. If one rushes into a clinical trial without much preclinical data, one has a much greater risk of failure. Since we have limited clinical trial funds and facilities, it would also increase the likelihood of successful clinical trials by focusing on those therapies that have the most supporting data.
The first successful clinical trial that restores function to people with subacute or chronic spinal cord injury will increase enthusiasm and funding for more clinical trials. If any of the six therapies listed above, or dozens of therapies that are awaiting clinical trials, were to succeed, I believe that companies will begin investing in spinal cord injury therapies. The first therapy is always the most difficult to get funded and moving. Many of the therapies would also be the first of their classes, i.e. the first regenerative therapy, the first cell transplant therapy, the first remyelinative therapy.
Two types of clinical trial failures are harmful to the spinal cord injury community, the investigators, and the sponsors. The first and worst are false negative trials, i.e. a trial that falsely indicates that treatment is ineffective, are particularly deleterious. Such trials may be underpowered, i.e. a trial that does not have enough subjects to establish significance. It may also happen if the wrong outcome measure is chosen. The second are inconclusive trials. Inconclusive trials may result from poor followup and high drop out rates.
Finally, it is important to note that clinical trials that show that a treatment is ineffective are not “failures”. Showing that a therapy does not work is just as important as showing that a therapy works. It stops the waste of further time and resources on that particular therapy. Thus, for example, many people believe that umbilical cord blood cells are beneficial for spinal cord injury. In fact, several overseas clinics are offering and charging for umbilical cord blood treatment of spinal cord injury as if they have already been proven to be effective. A rigorously conducted clinical trial that shows it is ineffective will stop wasteful practices.
Summary and Conclusions
Many people frequently ask how long it will take for a cure of spinal cord injury to be available. In the last two decades, about a dozen therapies have gone to clinical trial. To illustrate the course of therapy development, I described 8 therapies that have been through or are going into clinical trials for spinal cord injury.
High-dose methylprednisolone (MP) is the first spinal cord injury treatment to be tested in a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.
Weight-supported locomotor training is the first rehabilitation therapy that has been shown to restore function after spinal cord injury.
Fampridine (4AP) is the first therapy that improves conduction in demyelinated axons but has not yet been shown to be effective in spinal cord injury.
Nogo antibody is the first therapy shown to regenerate the spinal cord of rats and is currently in phase 2 clinical trials.
Cethrin is a membrane-permeable recombinant bacterial toxin C3 that blocks rho, improves recovery in animals and humans, and is in phase 2 clinical trial.
Olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG) have been transplanted to >1200 patients with chronic spinal cord injury but has not yet been tested in a controlled trial.
Human embryonic stem (HES) cells have been announced for clinical trial by Geron since 2005 and is still awaiting approval by the U.S. FDA.
Combination therapies. The China Spinal Cord Injury Network is now testing umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells and lithium alone and in combination.
The history of spinal cord injury therapy development teaches us three important lessons. First, therapy development is slow and tortuous, with each therapy taking 10 or more years. Second, rigorous proof of concept is required before companies, government, or foundations will invest millions into developing a therapy. Finally, clinical trials are inherently risky. A single mistake in trial design may set a program back by many years.
Development of curative therapies for spinal cord injury will require large clinical trial networks to test combination therapies systematically. To regrow large numbers of axons across the injury site, therapies need to bridge the injury site with cells that support growing axons, provide a long-term source of growth factors, and block growth inhibitors in the spinal cord, as well as replace cells. We know that each of these is possible.
The China Spinal Cord Injury Network is beginning clinical trials of the first combination therapy: umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells and lithium. Several groups had reported that cord blood cells are beneficial in animal models of spinal cord injury. Lithium enhances regeneration in the spinal cord, stimulates proliferation of cord blood cells and neural stem cells, and increases the production of neurotrophic factors. If this combination is effective, we will add growth inhibitor blockers.
So, how long will it take? Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch. Six of the eight therapies described above are already in or will soon be in clinical trials. Other therapies are achieving proof-of-concept and should reach clinical trial soon. Even if each of these trials has only a 50% chance of success, the odds ratio that at least one will succeed in the next few years is high. The time needed to develop curative combination therapies depends on funding and availability of clinical trial network.

Dr. Young;
My admiration for your dogged pursuit of a cure for SCI is boundless. You have empowered an entire generation of the SCI community. You give hope to those of living the life, both patients and family. It is not false hope based on empty promises. Rather, it is the hope of information gleaned from educating us about the science, the politics, and the spirit of human endeavor.
Thank you.
Many blessings for the New Year!

John, thank you. Your admiration mean a great deal to me and I want to say that I reciprocate a profound sense of gratitude for your writing (http://www.theothersideofbroken.com/). In my opinion, you have found your true vocation.
As you know, I have been wanting to update and expand the FAQ post that I made two years ago. It was also an opportunity to set a base for the new Spinal Cord Injury Wiki that we setting up in CareCure. One of my students is translating these articles into Chinese and we hope to establish the Wiki into two language.
The past year has been an epiphany for me. Coupled with the recession, I have realized that we can’t wait for others to do it for us. We need to do it for ourselves.
Wise.

The author especially thanks Sharon Walker, MSN, RN, for her contributions to this course, and Sim London, Jr., for color illustrations.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:
Identify bleeding complications of early and late pregnancy.
List the warning signs of complications following a spontaneous abortion.
Discuss the nursing care for patients experiencing an ectopic pregnancy.
Identify signs and symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Describe nursing care for patients with placenta previa and abruptio placentae.
Explain the maternal and fetal implications and suggest nursing care for patients with hyperemesis gravidarum.
Discuss the nursing response to pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.
Summarize the management of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Compare and contrast the care of patients with premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).
Explain the overall management of patients experiencing preterm labor.
Pregnancy is one of the most profound times in a woman’s life. It is marked by a variety of physical changes, as well as by thoughts and feelings that sometimes overwhelm the mother-to-be. Though pregnancy is generally a time of joy and well-being, complications can occur that cloud the experience and put the patient and her unborn child at risk.
These complications include bleeding in early or late pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidum, pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm rupture of membranes, and preterm labor and birth.
Nurses working in perinatal settings are in a unique position to screen, monitor and provide nursing care to patients who are affected by complications during pregnancy. It is essential for nurses to be familiar with these complications, as well as the maternal and fetal implications, medical treatment, and nursing care necessary to address these problems.
BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS: EARLY PREGNANCY
Spontaneous Abortion
Abortion describes the loss of pregnancy prior to fetal viability, which is typically defined as greater than 20 weeks’ gestation or fetal size greater than 500 gm. Abortion can be either spontaneous or induced. Spontaneous abortion, often called a miscarriage, occurs without intervention from the patient or another person.
TYPES
Spontaneous abortion affects 15-20% of recognized pregnancies (Puscheck, 2010). Spontaneous abortions can be caused by a number of factors, including chromosomal abnormalities, maternal infection, maternal endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, uncontrolled diabetes), reproductive system abnormalities (e.g., an incompetent cervix), and maternal injury. Literature suggests that drug use and environmental factors may also be linked to the occurrence of spontaneous abortion. Spontaneous abortions are classified according to symptoms and the outcome of the products of conception. Spontaneous abortions are considered threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete, missed, or recurrent.
Threatened abortions are diagnosed when there is vaginal bleeding and, possibly, uterine cramping. Patients suffering from a threatened abortion may or may not lose the fetus. However, careful monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary. Typically, patients are instructed to avoid sexual activity, tampons, and douches, as well as strenuous exercise. Patients are also encouraged to note and report bleeding to their healthcare provider.
Inevitable abortions occur when amniotic membranes rupture and the cervix dilates. In this case, abortion or miscarriage is considered inevitable. Patients typically have cramping. The products of conception are commonly expelled without intervention. However, a dilation and curettage (D&C) may be performed if necessary.
Incomplete abortions occur when some, but not all, of the products of conception are expelled from the uterus. The retained products prevent the uterus from contracting completely, which results in bleeding from uterine blood vessels. Patients generally experience severe cramping and profuse bleeding, and receive intravenous (IV) fluids and possibly blood products. Generally, a D&C is performed to remove the retained products of conception. Additionally, patients may receive medications such as oxytocin (Pitocin) or methylergonovine (Methergine) to contract the uterus and stop the bleeding.
Complete abortions occur when all of the products of conception including the fetus and placenta are expelled from the uterus. The cervix closes, and cramping and bleeding stop. Further intervention is typically not necessary. However, the patient is advised to notify her healthcare provider of any additional bleeding, pain or symptoms of infection, such as fever or foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
Missed abortions occur when the fetus expires during the first half of pregnancy, but is retained in the uterus. If there are no obvious signs of infection present, the patient may carry the fetus until spontaneous expulsion occurs. This may take several weeks. However, a D&C may be performed.
The term recurrent (or habitual) spontaneous abortion, refers to three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions. It is believed that genetic defects and reproductive system abnormalities are the primary causes of recurrent abortions. Patients are screened and examined for reproductive system abnormalities, such as recurrent premature dilation of the cervix, also known as incompetent cervix. In the case of the premature dilation of the cervix, a suturing procedure, known as a cerclage, may be performed to prevent the cervix from opening until delivery.
Reproductive system abnormalities may prevent the successful implantation and growth of the ovum. If the reproductive system is found to be normal, genetic screening is performed. Treatment of recurrent spontaneous abortion is based on the causative factor.

Slama and colleagues (2005) studied 5,121 California women who were less than 13 weeks gestation to determine the relationship between paternal age and spontaneous abortion, as chromosomal anomalies in spermatozoa appear to increase with paternal age (more specifically, fathers greater than 35 years old). They found that “the risk of spontaneous abortion increased with increasing paternal age [and] … that the association is stronger for first trimester losses” (p. 816). Kleinhaus and colleagues (2006) conducted a similar study with 13,865 women and concluded that “increasing paternal age is significantly associated with spontaneous abortion, independent of maternal age and multiple other factors” (p. 369).
NURSING CARE
Nursing care for patients experiencing a spontaneous abortion varies depending on the type of abortion. However, the primary nursing intervention for all types of spontaneous abortion is to ensure patient safety by identifying and controlling bleeding and hypovolemic shock. Symptoms of hypovolemic shock include an increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, cool and clammy skin, lightheadedness, and confusion. The nurse should anticipate the need for oxygen therapy and fluid and blood replacement. The nurse may also be responsible for administering medications; for example, oxytocin (Pitocin) may be used to help in expelling the products of conception or to control bleeding. Patients should be blood-typed and cross-matched in case a blood transfusion is necessary.
The nurse monitors vital signs, oxygen saturation, intake and output, and laboratory results according to institutional policies. If a patient experiences a threatened abortion but the fetus does not die, the nurse may be responsible for monitoring fetal heart sounds and the overall well-being of the fetus depending on gestational age. The nurse should administer prescribed Rhogam to Rh-negative patients within 72 hours to prevent isoimmunization.
The nurse caring for a patient experiencing spontaneous abortion will also need to help the patient explore her feelings regarding an actual or potential loss. Many patients feel that their actions somehow led to the spontaneous abortion; therefore, feelings of guilt are often significant emotional challenges that many patients must deal with while grieving their loss.
Similarly, patients who suffer from a threatened abortion and do not lose the fetus are often afraid that they may still lose the fetus and remain stressed throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. This affects not only the patient but also her family, and the nurse should do everything possible to assist the patient and her family during this time.
Complications of Missed Abortions
Two serious complications of missed abortions are infection and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Infection can occur as a result of carrying an expired fetus and is a serious health threat to these patients.
DIC occurs when there is an over-activation of the clotting process in the body. Specifically, the body produces excessive amounts of thrombin in attempts to control bleeding. This stimulates the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. As a result, clots form in blood vessels throughout the body and prevent blood flow to vital organs. Clotting factors are heavily consumed during this process and generalized hemorrhage occurs.
Essentially, DIC produces clotting, bleeding, and ischemia that occur simultaneously. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain and/or cyanosis that occur suddenly. Bleeding from the nose, gums, and IV sites, as well as petechiae also occur in the presence of DIC. Treatment is aimed at delivering the fetus and placenta, which will stop the over-activation of the clotting process. Patients are treated with oxygen therapy and are usually given blood products.
PATIENT TEACHING
Nurses are responsible for ensuring that patients are adequately prepared to care for themselves upon discharge from the hospital following treatment or monitoring for a spontaneous abortion. It is important that patients understand the warning signs of further complications and the importance of reporting such signs to their healthcare provider.
Warning signs include fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, significant bright red vaginal bleeding, and pelvic pain. In addition, patients are encouraged to avoid sexual activity, tampons, or douches. Experiencing a spontaneous abortion is challenging for patients both physically and emotionally and they need to rest for a few days after discharge. They may be required to take iron supplements as a result of significant blood loss and/or antibiotics to treat or prevent infection. Foods such as liver, green leafy vegetables, dried foods, and eggs provide needed iron. Additional fluid intake is recommended.
It is important that the nurse recognize and acknowledge the patient’s loss, or threatened loss. The patient needs to understand that it is normal for her to go through a grieving process and that she may grieve for six months to one year (McKinney et al., 2005). The patient should also be provided with appropriate community referrals for counseling and/or support groups. She may be eager to become pregnant again if she loses the fetus; however, she should be encouraged to allow her body to rest and recover before attempting another pregnancy and to discuss with her healthcare provider when the appropriate time to conceive would be.
CASE
R.L. is 29 years old and pregnant for the fifth time. Her first pregnancy occurred at 34 weeks’ gestation and produced her only living child. She had three spontaneous abortions at 12 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks. R.L. is currently at 12 weeks’ gestation and is at the clinic for her first prenatal checkup. She was seen crying quietly in the waiting room and later states, “My mother-in-law says that if I weren’t such a weak person I would not keep losing my babies.”
Discussion
R.L. had three consecutive spontaneous abortions, which indicates that she has a history of recurrent or habitual spontaneous abortion. She is at a stage of pregnancy where her healthcare provider might discuss causative factors, such as an incompetent cervix or genetic disorder. It is important that she understand that her behavior did not cause the numerous spontaneous abortions. R.L. should be given support and encouragement throughout her pregnancy.

Ectopic Pregnancy
Ectopic pregnancies occur when the ovum is fertilized by the sperm but implants outside the uterus in the fallopian tubes, cervix, ovary, or abdominal cavity. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tubes (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Possible implantation sites for ectopic pregnancies. (Illustration courtesy of Sim London, Jr.)
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
Approximately 2 in 100 pregnancies in the United States are ectopic (Cunningham, et al., 2005). Ectopic pregnancies are caused by a variety of factors, which include anything that would prevent or slow the fertilized ovum’s journey to the lining of the uterus. More specifically, anything that causes scarring in or blocks the fallopian tubes may cause an ectopic pregnancy. Patients who are of advanced maternal age or have reproductive system anomalies, repeated induced abortions, a history of tubal surgery, sexual transmitted infections (STIs), pelvic inflammatory disease or intrauterine devices (IUD) or a history of ART (assistive reproductive technology) procedures are at-risk for having an ectopic pregnancy (Hoover, Tao & Kent, 2010). The literature also suggests that women who douche regularly or smoke have a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, lack of menstruation (amenorrhea), and abdominal pain. However, other disease processes (e.g., spontaneous abortion) may be responsible for such symptoms. Ultrasound and laboratory testing are necessary to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.
The outcome of an ectopic pregnancy depends on the location of implantation. The ovum may naturally reabsorb into the body, or the structure supporting the ovum may rupture. If the implantation site is a fallopian tube, the tube may rupture and cause internal hemorrhaging and hypovolemic shock, which is a life-threatening event for the patient.
Signs and symptoms of a ruptured fallopian tube include vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain or pelvic, shoulder or neck pain (as a result of blood leaking out of the fallopian tube and irritating the diaphragm), weakness, dizziness, decreased blood pressure, and increased pulse. It is important to note that over 50% of patients experiencing an ectopic pregnancy are asymptomatic prior to tubal rupture (Chan & Johnson, 2004).
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
An ectopic pregnancy implanted in a fallopian tube requires either pharmacologic or surgical management. Pharmacologic management with methotrexate is indicated if the tube is unruptured, the ectopic pregnancy is less than 3.5 cm, the fetus is not living, and the patient is stable hemodynamically. Often, patients require more than one dose of methotrexate for effective treatment. Methotrexate treatment is usually performed on an outpatient basis.
If the fallopian tube is ruptured as a result of an ectopic pregnancy and the patient wants to become pregnant in the future, a surgical procedure called a linear salpingostomy is performed to protect the tube. A linear salpingostomy requires a small linear incision in the tube to remove the products of conception. The tube is then allowed to heal without suturing to prevent significant scarring. Significant scarring in the fallopian tube could potentially affect the ability of the patient to have a successful pregnancy in the future. If the tube is ruptured the patient does not desire a future pregnancy, a laparoscopic salpingectomy is performed. This procedure involves the actual removal of the affected fallopian tube.
NURSING CARE
The nurse caring for a patient experiencing an ectopic pregnancy looks for changes in the patient’s blood pressure and pulse, which could indicate hypovolemic shock resulting from hemorrhage. Regular assessment of vaginal bleeding is also essential. Rh-negative patients require administration of prescribed Rhogam to prevent isoimmunization. Finally, the nurse is responsible for monitoring and controlling pain levels.
If a linear salpingostomy or salpingectomy is performed, the nurse monitors vital signs, oxygen saturation, intake and output, and laboratory results according to institutional policies. As with all patients experiencing a pregnancy loss, it is important for the nurse to recognize the loss and to provide resources to assist the patient in coping with the emotions that accompany the experience of an ectopic pregnancy.
PATIENT TEACHING
Nurses are responsible for ensuring that the patient is aware of signs and symptoms that require a call to the healthcare provider or a return visit to the emergency room following hospital discharge. More specifically, if the patient experiences pain, significant bleeding, or a fever and chills, she needs to notify her healthcare provider. If methotrexate is used for the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy, the patient should be educated about the unpleasant side effects (nausea and vomiting) of methotrexate. The patient should have a clear understanding of the feelings of anger, sadness, or guilt that may arise following an ectopic pregnancy and that these feelings are a normal part of the grieving process for someone experiencing the loss of a pregnancy.
NURSE ALERT: Methotrexate
If methotrexate is used to treat an ectopic pregnancy, instruct the patient to avoid alcohol as well as foods and vitamins containing folic acid, which can decrease the effectiveness of the medication.
CASE
C.M. is a 42-year-old newlywed. She comes into the Women’s Health Clinic complaining of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain that is completely unlike her usual monthly cramping. She describes her pain as “very sharp” and an “11” on a scale of 0 to 10. Her vital signs are T 98.8, P 102, R 24, and BP 102/64. She indicates that her blood pressure is “usually 130/90.” She is unable to recall the date of her last menstrual period. Additionally, she has almost soaked an entire pad in the last hour. C.M. is very anxious and says, “I’ve never had any real female problems before, except for the little cramping I get on the first day of my period. I shouldn’t be having this difficulty because I keep my female parts very clean by douching weekly.” She admits sheepishly to having “the clap” five years ago.
Discussion
C.M. should be assessed for an ectopic pregnancy. Her risk factors include: advanced maternal age, regular douching, and a history of an STI. She is bleeding heavily and showing evidence of hypovolemia. The priority in this situation is to ensure patient safety by obtaining and sustaining hemodynamic stability.

Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)
Gestational trophoblastic disease, also known as a hydatidiform mole or a molar pregnancy, occurs when the chorionic villi of the placenta increase as a result of genetic abnormalities. The villi swell, forming fluid-filled sacs, which appear as tiny clusters of grapes within the uterus. Molar pregnancies are classified as complete or partial based on whether a fetus is present. A partial mole occurs when a fetus or an amniotic sac is present, whereas a complete mole only contains the fluid-filled sacs. The fetus is usually nonviable in a molar pregnancy. However, according to Dente (2007), although it is uncommon, “twinning” has been reported with a complete [mole] plus a surviving fetus with a normal placenta.”
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
GTD pregnancies are rare and occur in approximately 1 in 1000 pregnancies in the United States and Europe (Cunningham et al., 2005). Patients of advanced maternal age and of Asian descent have a higher risk of having a molar pregnancy. Additionally, patients who experienced a previous molar pregnancy have a higher risk of having a molar pregnancy in the future.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Patients with a GTD exhibit light to heavy bleeding and even hemorrhage. Bleeding can be bright red or brown, appearing similar to prune juice. Anemia may result due to bleeding. Additionally, as a result of the proliferation of tissues and the presence of clotted blood, the uterus may appear larger than expected for gestational age. Despite an enlarged uterus, fetal heart tones and movement are absent. Serum hCG levels are also increased and patients may experience hyperemesis. Symptoms of gestational hypertension before 24 weeks’ gestation are a strong indication of gestational trophoblastic disease.
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
Molar tissues are removed by vacuum aspiration. Intravenous oxytocin is usually administered to contract the uterus after the vacuum aspiration. It is important to note that oxytocin should not be administered prior to vacuum aspiration to avoid tissue being forced into venous circulation and subsequent embolization (McKinney et al., 2005). Gentle curettage, or scraping of the uterus, is performed to ensure that the uterus is emptied of all affected tissue.
NURSE ALERT: Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Follow-Up
Patients are followed for one year after removal of a molar pregnancy to detect choriocarcinoma, or cancer associated with GTD. If serum hCG levels do not return to pre-pregnancy levels, there is a possibility that choriocarcinoma may be present and further investigation is necessary. Therefore, it is essential that patients understand the need for follow-up.
NURSING CARE
It is vital that the nurse monitoring patients experiencing molar pregnancies assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding and shock, including changes in heart rate, blood pressure and urinary output. If a patient has hyperemesis resulting from the molar pregnancy, the nurse should assist the patient with mouth care and any additional interventions that are appropriate. Nursing care also includes pre- and post-operative care. Laboratory work, including a complete blood count, blood typing and crossmatching, and serum hCG levels is required prior to vacuum aspiration and curettage.
Rh-negative patients should receive Rhogam to prevent isoimmunization. As with all pregnancy losses, patients may exhibit grief in response to the loss. Patients should be informed that this is a normal response to a pregnancy loss; therefore, nursing care includes referring patients to appropriate providers or support groups as needed.
PATIENT TEACHING
Due to the risk of choriocarcinoma, it is vital that patients understand the need for regular follow-up to test serum hCG levels. Patients should also understand that another pregnancy immediately following a molar pregnancy should be avoided in order to monitor hCG levels without the interference of hCG from pregnancy. It is important that patients are aware of the signs and symptoms of complications following a molar pregnancy and vacuum aspiration, including excessive bleeding, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, and fever.
Patients should avoid tampons, douches, and sexual activity until the healthcare provider indicates that these activities can be performed safely. As a result of bleeding, patients may be anemic and require increased iron intake or possibly iron supplementation. Foods such as liver, green leafy vegetables, dried foods, and eggs can provide needed iron. The patient should also be encouraged to increase fluid intake.
CASE
J.J. is a 40-year-old prima gravida of Asian descent. The date of her LMP places her at 22 weeks’ gestation, although her fundal height is consistent with 26 weeks’ gestation. She indicates that throughout the pregnancy she had periodic spotting that resembles prune juice. J.J. states: “I knew pregnancy would be difficult at my age in spite of what my grandmother says, but I am vomiting so much that my weight is down to 102 pounds. My pressure is up a little but I guess that’s because of my age too.” J.J.’s records indicate that her weight at the initial prenatal visit was 110 pounds. Her vital signs are T 98.6, P 86, R 20, and BP 142/90, but fetal heart tones and movement are not detected. She has a small emesis of undigested food while sitting in the waiting room. She states, “It gets harder and harder to keep working in our restaurant.”
Discussion
J.J. should be assessed for a gestational trophoblastic disease. She has several risk factors and indications for this condition. She is of advanced maternal age and of Asian descent, she is having light bleeding, hyperemesis, and hypertension, and her uterus is larger than expected for gestational age. Following her diagnosis, the nurse may need to address with J.J. the loss of her pregnancy and the necessity for follow-up cancer screening. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS: LATE PREGNANCY
Placenta Previa
Placenta previa occurs when the placenta implants in the lower portion of the uterus by the internal cervical os. Previas are classified according to the degree to which they cover the os. Specifically, if the lower border of the placenta is close to, but does not quite reach, the internal cervical os, the previa is considered marginal. If the placenta partly covers the internal os, the previa is considered a partial placenta previa. The previa is considered a total previa if the placenta completely covers the internal cervical os (Figure 2). As the pregnancy nears term and the cervix dilates, the placenta implanted near or over the internal cervical os is disrupted and bleeding can occur. The bleeding places the patient and her unborn child at-risk.
Figure 2. Placenta previa. (Illustration courtesy of Sim London, Jr.)
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
Placenta previa occurs in approximately 1 in 200 pregnancies in the United States (McKinney et al., 2005). There are several factors that place patients at risk for a placenta previa..
RISK FACTORS FOR PLACENTA PREVIA
Advanced maternal age
Cesarean section
Smoking or drug use (e.g., cocaine)
Previous placenta previa
Uterine scarring (e.g., endometriosis)
Induced or spontaneous abortion
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
The most significantly recognized symptom of placenta previa is painless, bright red vaginal bleeding or hemorrhage during late pregnancy. It is imperative that vaginal examinations be avoided because stimulation of the placenta may cause hemorrhage. However, bleeding may not occur until labor begins.
MATERNAL AND FETAL IMPLICATIONS
As a result of the abnormally implanted uterus, the fetus is often in a transverse or breech position, which may be noted during fundal examination. The fetus may also experience hypoxia and possibly death from maternal bleeding. The patient may go into shock as a result of hemorrhage.
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
As previously mentioned, vaginal examination must be avoided if a patient presents with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding because hemorrhage may occur. A transabdominal ultrasound can be performed to diagnose the previa. Medical management of a placenta previa is largely determined by gestational age, fetal status, amount of bleeding, and type of previa. Some patients may deliver vaginally if they are near term, the cervix is ripe, the fetal heart tracing is reassuring, and there is minimal bleeding. However, if there is a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, significant bleeding, or hemorrhage, or a complete previa is present, a cesarean section is usually necessary.
NURSING CARE
Nursing care for patients with a placenta previa involves close monitoring of bleeding as well as fetal and maternal status. Significant bleeding or hemorrhage should be reported immediately to the appropriate healthcare provider. Regular assessment of fetal heart rate and movement is necessary. Non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns should be reported to the healthcare provider immediately. It is important to note that pregnant patients can experience significant blood loss (approximately 40%) without a change in vital signs (Lowdermilk & Perry, 2006). Therefore, careful monitoring of bleeding is imperative as vital sign changes may not be initially evident.
Patients with a placenta previa should remain on bed rest. Non-stress testing to evaluate fetal status is performed during bleeding episodes, while intermittent fetal heart tones are obtained according to medical orders or institutional policy. Patients should be blood-typed and cross-matched in case a blood transfusion is necessary. Intravenous access should be maintained for prompt administration of fluids or blood products.
A Kleihauer-Betke test is usually performed on Rh-negative patients to determine if the fetal blood has entered the maternal circulation as a result of fetal-maternal hemorrhage (Klossner, 2006). Rhogam is given to Rh negative patients during each bleeding episode to prevent isoimmunization.
PATIENT TEACHING
It is extremely important that patients with a placenta previa understand the need to maintain bed rest to prevent unnecessary pressure on the internal cervical area where the placenta is implanted. In addition, patients should be instructed to maintain pelvic rest by abstaining from sexual intercourse or using tampons or douches. Encourage the patient to prohibit vaginal examinations.
CASE
M.P., a 39-year-old woman, comes into the emergency department. She is in the 37th week of her fourth pregnancy. She has a history of two elective abortions. A moderate amount of bright red vaginal blood is noted. M.P. is crying loudly and asking for someone to call her husband. She states, “I don’t understand why I’m bleeding! Nothing hurts at all. I have changed all the bad things in my life. I’ve stopped smoking and using coke. I really, really want this baby.” The fetal heart tones and movement are regular and strong.
Discussion
M.P. will be assessed for placenta previa. She has the following risk factors: history of smoking, drug use, and multiple induced abortions. Her current symptom of painless, bright red bleeding is indicative of the condition. No vaginal examination will be performed and fetal assessment will continue. M.P. can expect to be on bed rest and may be hospitalized for continued evaluation and fetal surveillance. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
Abruptio Placentae
Abruptio placentae, often referred to as an abruption or placenta abruption, is the premature separation of the normally implanted placenta from the uterine wall before labor and delivery of the newborn. Bleeding occurs between the uterine wall and the placenta.
Abruptio placentae is classified according to the degree of placental separation and subsequent hemorrhage. An abruption can be partial or complete, with apparent or concealed hemorrhage (Figure 3). An abruption is partial if a section of the placenta separates from the uterine wall but the margins of the placenta remain intact. A complete abruption occurs when the entire placenta detaches from the uterine wall. Apparent hemorrhage refers to bleeding that is evident, while a concealed hemorrhage denotes bleeding that is obscured.
Figure 3. A, Partial abruption with concealed hemorrhage. B, Partial abruption with apparent hemorrhage. C, Complete abruption with apparent hemorrhage. (Illustrations by Jason M. McAlexander, MFA.)
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
Abruptio placentae occurs in 1 in 200 deliveries (Cunningham et al., 2005). Aside from abruptions occurring as a result of trauma, the cause of abruptio placentae is largely unknown. However, there are several factors that place patients at risk for an abruption (see box).
RISK FACTORS FOR ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE
Drug use (e.g., cocaine)
Alcohol abuse
Cigarette smoking
Hypertension
Diabetes mellitus
Advanced maternal age
Multiparity and multiple pregnancy
History of abruptio placentae
Thromboembolic disorders
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM)
Abdominal trauma (e.g., accident, violence)
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
The classic signs and symptoms of abruption placentae include vaginal bleeding, which may be dark red due to old blood from a concealed abruption, uterine tenderness, and a board-like abdomen. Patients often complain of an aching or dull pain in the abdomen or lower back. Additionally, uterine irritability with poor uterine resting tone is frequently noted.
MATERNAL AND FETAL IMPLICATIONS
Abruptio placentae is a life-threatening event for the patient and the fetus. Patients with an abruption are at risk for developing hypovolemic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and possibly death. Patients may also suffer from postpartum hemorrhage after delivery due to poor contractility of the uterus following an abruption. Since the placenta is the source of oxygenation for the unborn fetus, premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall can place the fetus at great risk for hypoxia and death.
MEDICAL TREATMENT
Abruptio placentae is usually diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound, in addition to the presenting signs and symptoms. Treatment is based on the degree of placental separation and subsequent hemorrhage, as well as the status of the patient and fetus. In the presence of severe abruption and hemorrhage, emergency cesarean section is performed. However, in some cases, the abrupted area is small and emergency delivery is not necessary. Vaginal delivery can be safely performed if the patient and fetus are hemodynamically stable (Davidson, Ladewig & London, 2008).
NURSING CARE
Although vaginal delivery is preferred to cesarean section for patients who are hemodynamically stable, the nurse must be prepared to deal with the possibility of severe hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock, as well as the resulting fetal distress. Patients should have intravenous access with a large bore catheter to accommodate the administration of fluid and blood products.
It is necessary to monitor carefully the status of the patient and fetus. Frequent vital signs and fetal heart tones, as well as monitoring and documentation of blood loss, is essential. Abnormal vital signs, bleeding, or non-reassuring fetal heart patterns should be reported immediately to the appropriate healthcare provider. Observation and documentation of the patient’s intake and output, and pain and comfort levels, is also essential. Patients should be blood typed and cross-matched in case a blood transfusion is necessary. Rhogam is indicated for Rh negative patients.
Because the potential for patient and fetal injury is high in the presence of abruptio placentae, it is important to address the emotional needs of the patient. Patients should be kept informed of the status of the fetus and the nurse should be available and ready to answer any questions that patients or their families may have.
PATIENT TEACHING
Patients should be instructed to report bleeding and severe abdominal pain immediately. It is important to inform patients with abruptio placentae that emergency delivery may be necessary. If a patient must have an emergency cesarean section, it is important for the nurse to quickly communicate to the patient and her family what will occur before and during the procedure. Nurses should remember that hemorrhage and emergency surgery can be very frightening; therefore, clear and honest information must be given to the patient and her family as frequently as possible.
CASE
R.E. has her first prenatal visit at 30 weeks’ gestation. She is extremely quiet, holds her head down, and stays very close to her husband, speaking in whispers only to him. R.E.’s husband then repeats her comments and questions to the nurse and clinic staff. Her uterine height and the fetal heart tones are all within normal limits. However, you observe multiple bruises in various stages of healing on her torso and legs and a moderate amount of dark vaginal blood on her peri-pad. Although R.E. (through her husband) denies any pain, she is sweating profusely and seems to have abdominal pain.
Discussion
The presence of bruises at various stages of healing and R.E.’s dependence on her partner to answer for her are indications that she appears to be a victim of intimate partner violence (IPV). There is also a possibility of abruptio placentae related to abdominal trauma. The patient has dark red vaginal bleeding and evidence of abdominal pain. It is important for the healthcare provider to speak with R.E. in private to discern the cause of her bruising and possible abuse. In addition, the nurse must ensure the safety of the patient and her unborn child. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
PLACENTA PREVIA vs. ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE
Assessment

HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM
Nausea and vomiting occur normally during pregnancy. However, nausea and vomiting that persists beyond the 20th week of gestation and interferes with the intake of food and fluid as well as adequate weight gain during pregnancy is termed hyperemesis gravidarum. The cause of hyperemesis is unknown, however, elevated hormonal levels and relaxation of smooth muscle resulting in delayed stomach emptying, along with stress, are believed to play a part in this disorder.
INCIDENCE
Hyperemesis gravidarum affects approximately 0.5% to 2% of pregnancies (Davis, 2004). Depending on the severity of the condition, patients suffering from hyperemesis may be hospitalized or admitted to home care services for monitoring.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Normal first-trimester nausea and vomiting can be challenging for pregnant women. However, patients with hyperemesis gravidarum are frequently debilitated by unrelenting vomiting and dry retching. Common signs and symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum are listed below.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM
Poor appetite
Poor nutritional intake
Vomiting beyond 20 weeks’ gestation
Significant weight loss (> 5% of pre-pregnancy weight)
Dehydration (dry mouth and mucous membranes, decreased skin elasticity (turgor) and dark, concentrated urine)
MATERNAL AND FETAL IMPLICATIONS
Patients with hyperemesis gravidarum frequently become dehydrated, and may have metabolic acidosis as a result of starvation. In addition, patients may become alkalotic from a loss of hydrochloric acid during vomiting. Electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and vitamin deficiencies are also common in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. Ultimately, long-term nausea and vomiting can cause renal and/or gastrointestinal impairment in the pregnant patient.
Dehydration occurring from hyperemesis gravidarum may result in preterm labor, which can negatively impact the fetus. In addition, dehydration impairs placental perfusion and affects nutrient intake and oxygenation of the fetus. Moreover, due to the severe nausea and vomiting associated with hyperemesis, poor maternal nutrient intake is common and fetal growth may be compromised, causing low-birth-weight infants.
MEDICAL TREATMENT
When diagnosing hyperemesis gravidarum, it is important to investigate the underlying causes of nausea and vomiting. These causes can include gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, peptic ulcer disease, and pyelonephritis. Patients usually require intravenous fluids and antiemetics to manage hyperemesis. While most care for hyperemesis is provided in the patient’s home, some patients may require hospitalization for nutritional support via enteral or parenteral access.
NURSE ALERT: Nausea and Vomiting
Research studies have examined the effectiveness of acupuncture and acupressure on nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Although there are differing opinions about the effectiveness of these therapies, several studies indicate that acupuncture and acupressure are effective modalities for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy (Steele, French, Gatherer-Boyles, Newman, & Leclaire, 2001; Smith, Crowther & Beilby, 2002; Betts, 2006; Smith & Cochrane, 2009).
NURSING CARE
The nurse caring for patients with hyperemesis gravidarum monitors and provides physical care as well as psychosocial support to patients. The nurse will administer intravenous fluids and antiemetics. Intake and output are carefully monitored, as well as gastrointestinal status. Laboratory results (e.g., ketones, electrolytes, complete blood count, liver enzymes) should be carefully monitored, with abnormal results reported to the appropriate healthcare provider. It is important to monitor for weight loss. The constant, prolonged nausea and vomiting associated with hyperemesis may easily result in malnutrition for pregnant patients. Often patients are unable to work or tend to activities of daily living. This underscores the need for the nurse to address the psychosocial needs of patients, which may involve simply listening to the patient or a referral to appropriate resources.
CASE
D.S. is in the 10th week of her first pregnancy. She has come to the second prenatal visit stating she has many questions. “I thought you got bigger when you have a baby. I started out weighing 130 pounds and on your scale I now weigh 121. Is it because of all the barfing?” D.S. describes vomiting 4 to 6 times per day: in the morning as soon as she gets out of bed, sometimes after eating lunch and after eating dinner. “If I’m not actually barfing, I can’t look at food because I feel like I will. My mom said its normal to have morning sickness but it’s not called ‘all-day sickness’ is it?” D.S.’s urine is amber-colored. She has poor skin turgor, flaking skin over much of her body, and sticky mucous membranes. “My husband is really beginning to complain about my not cooking anything. But really, if I smell any food, everything I’ve eaten comes up. I spew like a volcano. My husband has taken to calling me Mt. Vesuvius.”
Discussion
D.S. should be assessed further for hyperemesis gravidarum. She has decreased turgor, dry skin, and mucous membranes. D.S. reports constant nausea and frequent vomiting. Her weight loss is more than 5% of her pre-pregnancy weight and her urine is concentrated. The nurse should work with D.S. on interventions for improving her intake and curtailing the symptoms of hyperemesis. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
PATIENT TEACHING
Most of the nursing care provided to patients with hyperemesis gravidarum involves teaching the patient to deal with the associated nausea and vomiting. It is important for patients to understand the need to eat small, frequent low-fat meals throughout the day. Usually toast, dry cereal, and other bland foods such as bananas, rice, and apples are well tolerated. Patients should be instructed to identify and avoid foods and odors that trigger nausea and vomiting. In addition, patients should be encouraged to maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration.
Since constant, prolonged vomiting affects the patient’s mouth and desire to eat, nurses can teach and encourage patients to provide and maintain adequate oral care. Positive ketones in the urine indicate that patients are using fat stores to provide energy to themselves and their growing fetuses. Therefore, patients may be required to use urine dipsticks to monitor ketones while at home. The nurse will need to instruct patients in the appropriate use of the urine dipsticks.
NURSE ALERT: Notifying Healthcare Provider
Nurses should instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they notice dark urine, bloody vomitus, abdominal pain, dehydration, lack of urine output for 8 hours, inability to keep food down for 24 hours, or ketones in the urine (Davis, 2004).
PREGNANCY-RELATED HYPERTENSIVE COMPLICATIONS
Gestational hypertension, formerly known as pregnancy-induced hypertension, refers to hypertension occurring for the first time during pregnancy. Diagnosis of gestational hypertension requires a blood pressure that is greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg. The blood pressure should be elevated on at least two occasions 4 to 6 hours apart. The diagnosis is made after 20 weeks’ gestation and is characterized by a blood pressure that returns to normal by 12 weeks postpartum. Patients with gestational hypertension do not present with proteinuria, which is a characteristic of preeclampsia. However, gestational hypertension may progress to preeclampsia.
Preeclampsia is identified by a blood pressure that is greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg, in the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria). Preeclampsia is indicated when there is a finding of 300 mg of protein in a 24-hour urine test or 1 to 2+ protein or greater via urine dipstick.
Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures in the presence of preeclampsia. Usually, seizures are related to gestational hypertension and not to other causes. Seizures can occur anytime before, during, or after delivery of the fetus.
Preeclampsia Superimposed on Chronic Hypertension
Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension refers to chronic hypertension with a new onset of proteinuria in hypertensive patients without proteinuria before 20 weeks’ gestation or a sudden increase in proteinuria or blood pressure, or a platelet count less than 100,000 mm3 in patients with hypertension and proteinuria before 20 weeks’ gestation (Cunningham et al., 2005). Medical treatment and nursing care for patients with preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension is similar to that of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Patient with preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension are often treated with antihypertensive agents.
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
According to the National Vital Statistics Reports (2010), 38.8% of 1000 pregnancies were affected by pregnancy-related hypertensive complications in 2007. Additionally, pregnancy-related hypertension is a significant contributor to maternal and fetal mortality rates. Gibson and Carson (2010) indicate that gestational hypertension occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of pregnancies in the United States, while Leifer (2005) indicates that eclampsia occurs in 5% of pregnancies.
Primagravidas, African Americans, diabetics, patients of either young or advanced maternal age, and patients pregnant with multiples are at a greater risk for developing pregnancy-related hypertension. A family history of pregnancy-related hypertension is also a significant risk factor.
NURSE ALERT: Snoring Mothers
Franklin and colleagues (2000) conducted a research study and found that “hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of non-snorers (p <0.01). Preeclampsia occurred in 10% of snorers, compared with 4% of non-snorers (p <0.05). An Apgar score <7 was more common in infants born to habitual snorers. Growth retardation of the fetus, defined as small for gestational age at birth, had occurred in 7.1% of the infants of snoring mothers and 2.6% of the remaining infants (p <0.05)” (p. 137). (Courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.) Furthermore, Vankata and Venkateshiah (2009) indicate that “obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.”
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Vasospasm in the arterioles of patients with gestational hypertension causes increased blood pressure and a decrease in placenta and uterine perfusion. Renal blood flow is reduced, along with the renal glomerular filtration rate, which produces proteinuria. Headaches and visual disturbances are the result of cellular damage and cerebral edema caused by central nervous system changes in the presence of hypertension. Liver enlargement is the result of hepatic changes that lead to epigastric pain. Generalized vasospasm causes endothelial cell damage, which triggers coagulation pathways and, subsequently, abnormalities in bleeding and clotting can occur (Leifer, 2005).
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Signs and symptoms of pregnancy-related hypertension vary depending on the severity of the hypertension. However, the common signs and symptoms of pregnancy-related hypertension include headache, blurred vision, epigastric pain, weight gain (>2 pounds per week), oliguria, and proteinuria. Although no longer considered diagnostic of pregnancy-related hypertension (Cunningham et al., 2005), edema may still be noted in these patients.
MATERNAL AND FETAL IMPLICATIONS
Hypertension in pregnancy places patients and their fetuses at great risk for a variety of complications. Some of the most significant maternal complications of hypertension in pregnancy include cerebral vascular accident (CVA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and placental abruption from the elevated blood pressure. Additionally, patients are at risk for the development of HELLP syndrome in the presence of gestational hypertension. Just as its’ name implies, HELLP syndrome causes great dysfunction within the body that requires immediate intervention. It is characterized by:
Hemolysis of red blood cells, which leads to anemia
Elevated liver enzymes leading to epigastric pain
Low platelets, which cause abnormal bleeding and clotting as well as petechiae
Patients whose function continues to decline without intervention can develop eclampsia and are at risk for cerebral hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, hypoxic encephalopathy, and thromboembolic disorders (Callahan et al., 2004). Fetal complications include intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery resulting from decreased placenta perfusion.
MEDICAL TREATMENT
Medical treatment for patients with pregnancy-related hypertension greatly depends on the severity of hypertension and the gestational age of the fetus, as well as the potential risk to the patient and fetus. During early pregnancy, outpatient management is usually appropriate; these patients are monitored at home for blood pressure and proteinuria. Regular fetal monitoring is necessary to evaluate fetal well-being. In addition, placental perfusion tests can also be performed to assess and monitor uteroplacental sufficiency. Patients with evidence of advanced dysfunction, such as oliguria, renal failure, or HELLP syndrome, are usually delivered immediately (Leifer, 2005).
Since delivery is the only known cure for pregnancy-related hypertension, many healthcare providers will recommend immediate induction and delivery if the patient is near-term and shows signs of severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. However, if the healthcare provider determines that the fetus is too premature for delivery, antihypertensive medications may be administered to decrease blood pressure, thereby prolonging fetal growth in utero. Glucocorticoids are administered to enhance fetal lung maturity (Cunningham et al., 2005).
Healthcare providers may prescribe magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) during labor and delivery to prevent seizures. Magnesium sulfate is not used to control hypertension. Magnesium sulfate is administered intravenously via an infusion delivery device during delivery and for 24 hours post delivery. Since MgSO4 can cause fetal respiratory depression following delivery, arrangements should be made for specialized neonatal care.
NURSING CARE
Pregnancy-related hypertension presents a great risk to patients and their unborn fetuses. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the nurse to monitor the patient carefully for signs of a decline in health status. The nurse should immediately report increases in blood pressure, visual disturbance changes, severe headaches, epigastric pain, and oliguria to the appropriate healthcare provider.
While patients are hospitalized for pregnancy-related hypertension, the nurse will monitor blood pressure and the well-being of the fetus. If magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is prescribed for preeclampsia or eclampsia, a Foley catheter is usually inserted to monitor urine output and to obtain regular urine specimens. The nurse is responsible for administering MgSO4 and for monitoring its toxicity. Magnesium sulfate toxicity can be prevented by ensuring that urine output is adequate (at least 30 ml/hr), deep tendon reflexes are present, and the respiratory rate is greater than 12 breaths per minute. If MgSO4 toxicity is noted, the healthcare provider must be notified immediately and the infusion discontinued. Calcium gluconate can be administered when prescribed to reverse the effects of magnesium MgSO4 toxicity. The serum magnesium level for patients receiving MgSO4 should be 4 to 7 mg/dl (Cunningham et al., 2005).
In the presence of eclampsia, the nurse must be prepared to prevent injury to the patient during seizures and to monitor seizure activity. Bed side rails should be up and padded. Emergency equipment should be readily available, including an oral airway, oxygen, a bag-valve-mask (BVM), and emergency medication. In the event of a seizure, patients should be protected from injury. The nurse should note the beginning and ending of the seizure and ensure adequate oxygenation after seizure activity has ceased. The nurse should not attempt to insert an oral airway or other object into the mouth during a seizure. The head can be gently turned to the side to prevent the aspiration of mucus and vomitus into the lungs during seizure activity (Leifer, 2005). The nurse obtains vital signs and monitors the fetus following the seizure.
NURSE ALERT: Seizures and Labor Progression
Labor may progress rapidly during seizure activity. Sometimes newborns are delivered suddenly during a seizure (Leifer, 2005). The nurse should be prepared for an imminent delivery in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia.
PATIENT TEACHING
Patients suffering from pregnancy-related hypertension who are being treated on an outpatient basis are taught to monitor themselves and their unborn child for a decline in health status. Specifically, patients are taught to notify their healthcare provider if they experience headaches, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, or sudden weight gain. Patients may be taught to monitor their weight, blood pressure, and urine protein at home. They are instructed to notify the appropriate healthcare provider of elevated blood pressures or protein in the urine. They should also be instructed to perform daily fetal kick counts to monitor fetal well-being, as well as to increase protein intake because proteinuria decreases the amount of available protein.
The nurse encourages patients with pregnancy-related hypertension to rest in the left side-lying position as much as possible, whether at home or in the hospital. This position prevents unnecessary pressure on the vena cava, which decreases renal and placental blood flow and leads to increased blood pressure (Leifer, 2005). The patient should also be instructed to decrease environmental stimuli by lowering or turning off lights and by decreasing the volume on radios or televisions as well as decreasing the number of visitors. Nursing care should be performed in a manner that prevents unnecessary disturbances to the patient’s environment while hospitalized. Stress and anxiety is a major concern in patients with pregnancy-related hypertension, as it can lead to increased blood pressure. Therefore, the nurse should discuss stress and anxiety management with patients.
CASE
E.D., a 16-year-old, comes to the OB clinic for her regular checkup. She is pregnant for the first time, with twins, and is in her 37th week of gestation. When her name is called she rushes in to the examination room saying, “I’m so glad my appointment was today. I would’ve come in even if it wasn’t. Mom couldn’t make it today. I had to catch the bus. My head feels like it’s going to explode and my face has gotten fat like my belly. I can’t wait for this whole thing to be over.” E.D.’s vital signs are T 98.2, P 70, R 20, and BP 150/98. Her urine is 2+ for protein. Pitting edema of +2 is noted bilaterally in the lower extremities. The fetal heart rates are in the 150s for both fetuses. E.D.’s mother usually attends prenatal appointments and has talked in the past about the seizures she experienced when she was pregnant with E.D.
Discussion
E.D. will be assessed thoroughly for complications associated with pregnancy-related hypertension. She has some risk factors and exhibits several symptoms. E.D. is very young, is pregnant with twins, and has a family history of eclampsia. She has proteinuria, facial edema, and edema of the lower extremities. E.D. may be hospitalized on bed rest for evaluation of her condition. Her vital signs will be closely monitored with attention to fetal well-being, urinary output, and reports of headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain. The goals of hospitalization include prevention of seizure and promotion of a safe delivery. Since E.D. is so close to her due date, an induced delivery may be considered.

GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS
Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs with the onset of pregnancy and is characterized by the inability of the pregnant patient to tolerate glucose. Patients who develop gestational diabetes may develop diabetes later in life. However, gestational diabetes often resolves after delivery. The cause of gestational diabetes is largely unknown. However, it is believed that, as the fetus grows, glucose demands increase for the pregnant patient. In addition, the “insulin-antagonistic” properties of placental hormones affect the patient by causing insulin resistance (Lowdermilk & Perry, 2006). As a result, the pregnant patient is unable to process glucose in the body and hyperglycemia occurs.
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
According to the American Diabetes Association (n.d.), gestational diabetes affects 7% of pregnancies in the United States. Several factors that place patients at risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus are listed below.
RISK FACTORS FOR GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS
Maternal obesity
Advanced maternal age
Member of a minority population
GDM in previous pregnancies
Presence of glycosuria
History of a macrosomic infant(s) (birthweight >4500 g)
History of spontaneous abortion or fetal demise
Family history of diabetes mellitus or GDM
MATERNAL AND FETAL COMPLICATIONS
A variety of maternal and fetal complications are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus. Patients have a significant chance of delivering via cesarean section due to the large size of infants born to patients with gestational diabetes. Patients also have an increased frequency of hypertension (Cunningham et al., 2005).
Infants born to patients with gestational diabetes mellitus are usually macrosomic (birthweight >4500 grams). This occurs due to fetal hyperinsulinemia as a result of maternal hyperglycemia, which stimulates excessive growth. These large infants may have difficulty maneuvering the birth canal and a cesarean section may be required. If vaginal delivery is attempted, the infant is at risk for shoulder dystocia or other birth injuries. After delivery, the newborn infant’s blood glucose must be monitored regularly due to the sharp decrease in available glucose after the umbilical cord is cut. The newborn’s pancreas continues to produce insulin after delivery despite the decrease in serum glucose. This adds to the potential instability of the infant’s blood glucose. Infants are also at risk for hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and respiratory distress syndrome as a result of gestational diabetes.
MEDICAL TREATMENT
Pregnant patients are routinely screened for gestational diabetes mellitus between 24 and 29 weeks’ gestation. In order to diagnose gestational diabetes, patients drink 50 grams of oral glucose solution. After one hour, a blood sample is obtained and tested for glucose tolerance. A glucose level of 135 to 140 mg/dL is considered a positive screen and further investigation is warranted; A 2-hour or 3-hour glucose tolerance test is then typically performed (Cunningham et al., as cited in Lowdermilk & Perry, 2006).
Most patients with gestational diabetes are treated through diet. They are encouraged to consume a proper diet and obtain adequate exercise. According to the American Diabetes Association (as cited in Cunningham, et al., 2005), patients with gestational diabetes should consume a diet that provides 30-kcal/kg/d. Furthermore, they indicate that patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 may benefit from a 30% to 33% caloric restriction. Besides proper diet and exercise, some patients may require insulin or oral hypoglycemia agents to manage gestational diabetes mellitus.
NURSE ALERT: Resistance Exercise and Gestational Diabetes
Brankston and associates (as cited in Cunningham, et al., 2005), indicate that resistance exercise can help overweight patients with gestational diabetes avoid insulin therapy.
NURSING CARE
It is important for the nurse to monitor serum glucose levels as well as ketones and glucose in the urine throughout the pregnancy of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. A referral to a dietician may also be necessary. The nurse may also conduct regular fetal surveillance including non-stress tests (NST) or biophysical profiles (BPP) starting from 32 to 36 weeks’ gestation and until delivery.
During labor, the patient with gestational diabetes mellitus may need to be on intravenous insulin and glucose; blood glucose levels will be monitored regularly according to medical orders or institutional policies. Blood glucose may be monitored as often as every hour.
After delivery, the nurse is responsible for monitoring the infant’s blood glucose levels, as glucose instability is common in newborns born to patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. If the newborn’s blood glucose level is below acceptable national or institutional standards, usually <40 mg/dL, treatment with intravenous fluids, intravenous or oral glucose, or early feedings is necessary. Nurses must be aware of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia in the newborn, including jitteriness, tremors, irritability, lethargy, seizures, tachypnea, temperature instability, and/or poor feeding and take appropriate action to assist in the treatment of hypoglycemia.
PATIENT TEACHING
The nurse working with patients who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus is often responsible for teaching the patient how to self-monitor and record glucose and ketones at home. In addition, the nurse can teach patients about proper diet and safe exercise during pregnancy. During prenatal visits, the nurse reviews the blood glucose and diet logs to make recommendations about monitoring, medication administration, and diet. Patients may also need to learn how to self-administer insulin. The nurse should make sure the patient can comfortably and appropriately check blood glucose levels and administer insulin by requesting a return demonstration.
It is imperative that the nurse teach patients with gestational diabetes the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. These signs and symptoms include shakiness, anxiety, headache, hunger, cold, clammy skin, and tingling around the mouth. The patient should be taught to closely monitor for hypoglycemia and to notify their healthcare provider immediately if signs and symptoms are noted. The patient can drink milk or juice or eat fruit to correct hypoglycemia (Leifer, 2007).
Since the potential for developing diabetes is significant in patients with gestational diabetes, it is important that patients understand the need for follow-up evaluation after delivery. Patients should continue to watch for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and notify their healthcare provider if seen.
CASE
A.B. is a 31 year-old patient pregnant for the fourth time. She has one living child, born at 36 weeks of gestation weighing 11 pounds. A.B. had a stillborn baby born at 36 weeks and one spontaneous abortion. This is her routine 28-week prenatal visit. She arrives early to drink a 50-gram dose of glucose cola and have blood drawn for the oral glucose challenge test. The results of the test are abnormal.
Discussion
A.B. shows signs of a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. A macrosomic infant, a stillborn, and a spontaneous abortion are indicative of a diabetic mother. She will be taught to monitor her blood glucose levels and self-administer insulin. The nurse will stress to A.B. the importance of proper diet and blood glucose control for her health and the health of her unborn baby. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
AMNIOTIC MEMBRANE COMPLICATIONS
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) refers to the rupture of membranes 1 hour or more before the onset of labor, whereas preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) refers to the rupture of membranes prior to 37 weeks’ gestation. Preterm premature rupture of membranes and PROM are often associated with preterm labor and birth.
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurs in 3% of pregnancies and is the cause of one-third of preterm deliveries (Medina & Hill, 2006). Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) occurs in 3%- to 18% of all pregnancies (Brown, 2000). Risk factors for preterm premature and premature rupture of membranes include infections such as STIs, a prematurely dilated cervix, hydramnios, multiple pregnancy, fetal malpresentation, maternal nutritional deficiencies, and stress. African American patients have a higher risk of developing early rupture of membranes (Brown, 2000). “Between 80% and 90% of those women who rupture membranes between 28 and 34 weeks [gestation] will give birth within 7 days” (Davidson, London & Ladewig, 2008).
NURSE ALERT: Respiratory Diseases and PROM
Getahun and colleagues (2007) hypothesized “… that acute and chronic respiratory diseases [were] associated with [an] increased risk of spontaneous PROM through bacteremia and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines” (p. 670). After conducting a study of the delivery data for more than 41 million women, they found that “of the acute respiratory conditions, acute upper respiratory disease and viral and bacterial pneumonia were associated with PROM, but not acute bronchitis. Of the chronic respiratory conditions, asthma was associated with PROM, but chronic bronchitis was not” (p. 671).
MATERNAL AND FETAL IMPLICATIONS
Preterm premature rupture of membranes can cause a variety of problems, especially for the unborn fetus. Without the protective barrier of the amniotic membrane, the fetus is at a greater risk for the development of infection and preterm delivery. The fetus is also at risk for becoming septic after delivery. Additionally, without the cushioning of the amniotic fluid there is a higher probability of umbilical cord compression as well as cord prolapse.
Patients with PPROM or PROM have a risk of developing chorioamnionitis, which is an infection of the chorion and amnion of the placenta that can be life-threatening for the patient and fetus.
MEDICAL TREATMENT
The first step in determining the appropriate course of action for patients with PROM or PPROM involves distinguishing amniotic fluid from urine. Often patients complain of a “sudden gush” or a constant trickle of fluid from the vagina once the membranes have actually ruptured. The healthcare provider will then perform a sterile speculum examination to look for pooling of amniotic fluid near the cervix. Fluid is tested using nitrazine paper as well as via microscopic examination for the presence of “ferning.” Ultrasound examination may be performed to determine the amount of available amniotic fluid after the rupture of membranes.
Medical treatment for patients with PPROM or PROM depends on a variety of factors. Gestational age, fetal lung maturity, available amniotic fluid, and etiology must be considered before deciding on treatment. Patients near term whose labor does not begin spontaneously following the rupture of membranes may be induced if the cervix is ripe. For preterm patients, healthcare providers and patients may desire to prolong the pregnancy to promote fetal lung maturity. Patients who are preterm may be prescribed corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity until deliver occurs or until there is a need to induce labor.
The cause of early rupture of membranes as well as the degree of amniotic fluid loss must also be considered when determining the appropriate course of action for patients with PPROM. Antibiotics are often administered to treat any infection and to prevent chorioamnionitis. If there is a significant loss of amniotic fluid rather than a slow leak, there is a stronger possibility of the need to induce labor. However, in preterm gestation, an amniotic sac with a slow leak of amniotic fluid may form a seal and the amniotic fluid may reestablish itself (McKinney et al., 2005).
NURSING CARE
As with medical treatment, nursing care greatly depends on whether the medical diagnosis is PPROM or PROM. However, nursing care typically involves assisting the healthcare provider to confirm the rupture of membranes, monitoring the patient for infection and for the presence of uterine contractions, and monitoring the status of the fetus. It is imperative that the nurse change patient underpads frequently and avoid unnecessary vaginal examinations to prevent infection.
Often, patients with PPROM who are considered stable are initially monitored on an inpatient basis and then discharged to home. Nursing care for these patients involves teaching about the signs and symptoms of preterm labor and when to call the healthcare provider. Nursing care for patients whose labor is induced involves administering induction agents and monitoring the status of the patient, fetus, and uterine contractions. As with all complications in pregnancy, the nurse should be available to answer questions and assist in relieving the patient’s anxiety about her diagnosis.
NURSE ALERT: Cord Prolapse
When dealing with PPROM and PROM, the nurse should be prepared to deal with cord prolapse and compression, which can occur as the umbilical cord slips down in the pelvis and is a life-threatening situation for the fetus; therefore, the fetus must be monitored closely. In the event of cord prolapse and compression, the nurse should attempt to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord and instruct the patient to quickly move into the knee-chest or Trendelenburg position. Oxygen should be administered and the healthcare provider notified immediately.
PATIENT TEACHING
It is important for patients with PPROM to understand the signs and symptoms that suggest infection as well as preterm labor, which often follows PPROM. Patients should be instructed to call their healthcare provider or report to the hospital immediately if the following signs and symptoms are noted:
Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C)
Foul-smelling vaginal discharge or other signs of infection
Uterine contractions or cramping (including tightening of the abdomen)
Decreased fetal movement
In addition, patients should be encouraged to avoid activities or objects that might induce labor or cause infection by exposing the cervix to bacteria. These include sexual activity, orgasm, nipple stimulation, and tampons and douches. Some patients may be placed on bed rest and should be encouraged to follow this directive to prevent preterm labor.
CASE
N.M. a 26-year-old in the 30th week of her second pregnancy has come to the clinic for an additional prenatal visit. “I came in because I’m not sure what’s going on down there. It feels like I’m peeing on myself, but I don’t think I am.” A small amount of clear liquid is noted on N.M.’s peri-pad. “It all started yesterday morning, and when I told my husband he said I should stay home from work, relax, and take a nice hot bath.” A sterile speculum was used to sample the fluid pooled near the cervix. When tested using nitrazine paper and examined microscopically, the fluid is alkalotic and shows ferning. N.M. is not experiencing any cramping or uterine contractions. Fetal heart tones are strong and regular and all of N.M.’s vital signs are within normal limits. N.M. asked “Does this mean I will have a dry labor?”
Discussion
N.M. has preterm premature rupture of membranes. Since she is stable, is now leaking only small amounts of fluid, and has no signs of infection, her healthcare provider may choose to discharge N.M. to her home with appropriate discharge instructions. N.M. will be told to take her temperature twice a day and report a reading higher than 100.4°F (38°C), as well as, uterine tenderness, uterine contractions, or offensive-smelling vaginal discharge. N.M. should avoid activities or objects that might bring about labor or cause infection. She will be told to avoid taking baths. N.M. should be informed that, because amniotic fluid is constantly being formed, she will not experience a dry labor. N.M.’s healthcare provider may put her on bed rest with bathroom privileges. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
PRETERM LABOR AND BIRTH
Preterm labor refers to labor that occurs after 20 weeks’, but before 37 weeks’, gestation. Preterm birth, a consequence of preterm labor, refers to delivery prior to 37 weeks’ gestation.
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
Preterm labor is responsible for preterm birth, which affects the ability of the newborn to adjust to extrauterine life. According to the National Vital Statistics Reports (2010), the preterm birth rate in the United States in 2008 was 12.3%, which was an increase from 2000 data. Preterm birth is a significant contributor to infant mortality rates. The box below presents a variety of risk factors that predispose patients to preterm labor and subsequent birth.
RISK FACTORS FOR PRETERM LABOR AND BIRTH
Infection
Dehydration
PPROM
Uterine bleeding
Diabetes
Substance abuse
Smoking
Incompetent cervix
Multiple gestation
Preeclampsia
Poor nutrition
Poverty (e.g., homelessness, low socioeconomic status)
History of preterm labor and birth
Young or advanced maternal age
Intimate partner violence (IPV)
MATERNAL AND FETAL IMPLICATIONS
Preterm labor and birth present a unique challenge to patients and their fetuses. Although most of the implications apply to the fetus, patients may suffer from stress due to the diagnosis of preterm labor and birth as well as from the causative agent. Specifically, patients may be experiencing preterm labor and birth due to conditions such as sepsis or IPV. The fetus is at great risk for delivering early as a result of preterm labor. The effects of preterm labor and birth depend on the gestational age of the fetus at delivery. However, the immaturity of fetal lungs in the presence of preterm labor and birth is a significant concern for healthcare providers.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Patients presenting with preterm labor and birth often complain of feeling pressure in the pelvic area, abdominal and/or uterine cramping or contractions, painful or painless contractions, feeling as though the fetus is “balling up,” and/or constant back pain. Amniotic membranes may rupture prematurely, therefore a sudden gush or constant trickle of vaginal fluid may be noted.
MEDICAL TREATMENT
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (as cited in Cunningham et al., 2005), in order for a diagnosis of preterm labor to be given, the following should be noted: 4 contractions in 20 minutes or 8 contractions in 60 minutes with a progressive change in the cervix, cervical dilation greater than 1 cm and cervical effacement of 80% or greater.
Medical treatment for preterm labor and birth is dependent upon the gestational age of the fetus. Generally, healthcare providers seek to avoid delivery of patients prior to 34 weeks’ gestation to allow further maturation of the fetal lungs (Cunningham et al., 2005). Often healthcare providers prescribe antibiotics to treat infection, glucocorticoids to increase fetal lung maturity, intravenous therapy to maintain hydration, and tocolytics to control uterine contractions in patients with preterm labor.
NURSING CARE
Nursing care for patients experiencing preterm labor include administering prescribed medications such as antibiotics, glucocorticoids, intravenous fluids, and tocolytics, and preparing the patient for possible delivery. While hospitalized, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, which can lead to preterm labor. Fetal tachycardia indicates possible infection and should be evaluated immediately. Vital signs, contractions, and fetal status should be assessed as ordered or according to institutional policy. As patients are often permitted to remain at home once stable, nursing care for these patients include teaching patients preventive measures that will help them avoid early delivery.
When patients are faced with the possibility of delivering a preterm infant, the situation may quickly become overwhelming to them. Although preterm labor and birth can occur rapidly, it is imperative that nurses address the emotional issues of the patient. Generally, this will involve answering patient questions about the status of the fetus and preparing the patient for the care required to prevent delivery or the necessary preparation for preterm delivery.
PATIENT TEACHING
The major goal of teaching patients with preterm labor is to help them become aware of factors that may cause premature labor and delivery.
TEACHING PATIENTS EXPERIENCING PRETERM LABOR
Avoid activities that may disturb the cervix and cause labor or infection (e.g., vaginal exams, sexual activity, orgasm, tampons, douches).
Rest in the left side-lying position to improve blood flow to the uterus.
Consume adequate fluid to prevent dehydration, which causes the release of oxytocin.
Encourage the patient to notify the healthcare provider immediately if any of the following signs and symptoms are noted: uterine contractions, cramping or irritability, constant back pain, a feeling that the fetus is “balling up,” a gush or a constant trickle of vaginal fluid, or fever.
CASE
C.F. phones the perinatal clinic. She is 18 years old and in the 32nd week of her second pregnancy. C.F.’s first child was born at 36 weeks’ gestation. After reviewing her chart, the nurse discovers that there is a history of social service intervention: As a result of C.F.’s impoverished circumstances, C.F. and her 3-year-old child receive nutritional support through the WIC (women, infants, and children) program, and live in a shelter to escape from an abusive cohabiting male.
C.F. is sobbing over the phone and keeps repeating “I don’t want it to happen again.” The nurse asks C.F. to take a deep breath, sit down, and explain how she is feeling. After a short time, C.F. states that she is having uterine contractions that are occurring every 10 minutes and lasting for 1 to 2 minutes. The contractions started about 3 hours ago and did not stop when she tried to walk. Asked about a gush of water from the vagina, she denies it.
C. F. says, “I still feel the baby kicking. That’s a good thing, isn’t it? Did I make this happen?” C.F. is told to have someone bring her to the hospital as soon as possible. She states that she already called for a ride and that she should be arriving at the hospital within 30 minutes. The nurse tells C.F. to lie down on her left side, drink plenty of fluid and wait for her ride. C.F. states “I can do that. Lisa, my roommate is napping and won’t wake up for a while.”
Discussion
C.F. is in the 32nd week of her pregnancy and may be in preterm labor. She has several risk factors including: poverty, a history of preterm labor and birth, poor nutrition, and possibly IPV. C.F. will be assessed for the condition of her cervix and amniotic membranes upon arriving at the hospital. Vital signs, contractions, and fetal status will be evaluated. C.F. will also be observed for signs of infection and dehydration. She is very anxious and, because she has had a previous preterm birth, she may have feelings of guilt that require reassurance and psychological support. The goal of her hospitalization would be to avoid delivery. (Case study, courtesy of Sharon Walker, MSN, RN.)
CONCLUSION
Pregnancy, labor, and birth are a wondrous time in the lives of countless women and their families. However, this time can be clouded by a variety of complications that affect the patient and fetus. Fortunately, with early identification and treatment of complications and their side effects, patients and their children have a greater chance of survival and the potential to thrive after delivery.
Nurses play a special role in ensuring the safety of the patient and her unborn child during all phases of pregnancy and delivery. They must be knowledgeable about complications that can occur during pregnancy and ready to act on behalf of the patient and her child. This is the responsibility and goal of the perinatal nurse. Most hospitals and birthing centers provide guidelines for nurses providing care to patients experiencing complications during their pregnancies and nurses should always follow the recommendations of their facilities.

BACKGROUND: This article compares the effect of treatment with short-acting insulin (SAI) analogues vs regular insulin on glycemic control, hypoglycemic episodes, quality of life, and diabetes-specific complications. METHODS: Electronic searches (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) and additional searching (pharmaceutical companies, experts, approval agencies, abstracts of diabetology meetings) were performed. Two reviewers independently screened randomized controlled trials to determine inclusion. RESULTS: Forty-two randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of SAI analogues vs regular insulin in 7933 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes mellitus were identified. The weighted mean difference between hemoglobin A(1c) values obtained using SAI analogues and regular insulin was -0.12% (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.17% to -0.07%) for adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and -0.02% (95% CI, -0.10% to 0.07%) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The standardized mean difference for overall hypoglycemia (episodes per patient per month) was -0.05 (95% CI, -0.22 to 0.11) and -0.04 (95% CI, -0.12 to 0.04) comparing SAI analogues with regular insulin in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. No differences between treatments were observed in children with type 1 diabetes, pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and women with gestational diabetes. Concerning quality of life, improvement was observed only in open-label studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. No differences were seen in a double-blinded study of patients with type 1 or in the studies of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests only a minor benefit to hemoglobin A(1c) values in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus but no benefit in the remaining population with type 2 or gestational diabetes from SAI analogue treatment.

The Common Cold
is associated with cold, cold is a disease that can have at any time of year at any age. Infection is one of the most typical and there are few who can boast of not having had any in recent months.
In fact, statistics say that an adult suffers two to five colds per year, ranging between four and ten children. With this data, “in Spain would mean a total 80 million colds a year,” reflects the National Study on Vicks cold. Therefore, we must know what we face and how to prevent and reduce symptoms.
A viral disease
when you suffer a cold, the main areas affected are the nose, which suffers mucus, and throat, often irritated and cause discomfort and alterations in voice. Although there are a number of viruses such as rhinovirus or coronavirus that stand, this disorder may be due to more than 200 different viruses. “This is what makes it impossible to have an effective vaccine to protect them,” said the report.
The most visible symptoms when colds are mild discomfort usually fall into the upper airways such as coughing, difficulty breathing through the nose, throat irritation, sneezing, watery eyes, decreased sense of smell, hoarseness, and sometimes can lead to headache or fever, without reaching the severity of flu. These symptoms usually last an average of three or five days, depending on the person.
Child Thermometer
although experts agree that colds are much less contagious than the flu, follows a series of measures to avoid infecting people around us if we are cold. “The cold virus transmission is through droplets of saliva that are expelled while talking, coughing or sneezing, first affecting the cells of the airways,” say the specialists. To avoid extreme we always cover our health and our well’s mouth when sneezing or tosamos.
• How to relieve the symptoms?
When an infection caused by a virus, there are no medications that can cope and we can only follow a few basic recommendations to try to lessen the symptoms and that they affect as little as our quality of life. Following this, you must be very clear that self-medication is strongly discouraged, much less come to antibiotics as a remedy without consulting your physician.
You can enlist the help of nasal sprays or mints sold in pharmacies, which help relieve nasal mucus and ease sore throat. Experts also suggest hydrate your body with fluids, both water and hot tea and soups. Another solution is to use humidifiers for the environment, facilitating the excretion of mucus.
On the other hand, we should avoid alcohol and snuff, and a balanced diet full of vitamins, and try to escape from stress as it affects our immune system and can weaken it and make it more vulnerable. Similarly, experts advise against the cold and sudden temperature changes and go for walks as much as possible to enable our circulatory system and our defenses.
In addition, we can help make home remedies and steam inhalations of eucalyptus to clear nasal passages, gargle with salt water to relieve sore throat and take garlic, which is proven to help fight germs. Finally, we can afford a hot bath to relax we get home and can be very effective to clear the nose

Anemia
Anemia characterized by producing a feeling of weakness in patients with the disease, but internally, is a reduction of red cell mass of the body, ie the number of red blood cells, resulting in a decrease in oxygen transport and a lack of oxygen to the tissues.
There are different types of anemia and may be due to alterations in stem cells or deficit of factors that stimulate or are needed for erythropoiesis (technical name of the formation of red blood cells). It is also common, and also more known, iron deficiency anemia, caused by iron deficiency. Another type of megaloblastic anemia is common, caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid. On the other hand, there are also peripheral anemias, caused by blood loss or breakage of red blood cells in the circulation (hemolytic anemia).
Logically, the manifestations of anemia is greater the smaller the amount of hemoglobin, which indicates a more serious situation. Dr. Villegas, a member of the Spanish Association of Hematology and Hemotherapy, says they also play an important role in the patient’s age and the rapidity of onset of anemia.
Among the most common symptoms include: pale skin and mucous membranes, fatigue progressive leg pain, cramps, loss of strength, headache or ringing in ears. Also, irritability, poor memory and concentration as well as loss of appetite, gastrointestinal disorders, absence of menstruation and decreased libido or sexual desire.
In addition, the expert notes that? Are common symptoms that affect the heart?, Such as palpitations. In the case of iron deficiency anemia (caused by lack of iron), we find as most characteristic signs of hair loss, broken nails or lesions in the corners of the lips.
the presence of anemia is detected through blood or blood count. The latter study allows knowing the number of erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets, and other parameters that identify the type of anemia in the event that there is.
In this regard, Villegas said that another important fact is to assess the morphology, ie the shape of these red blood cells under a microscope. He adds that the diagnosis of each particular type of anemia requires the participation of specialized laboratories.
This assessment will determine the best treatment in each case. Anemia, especially if severe and rapid onset produces a range of symptoms that impair quality of life of patients and makes they feel tired, miserable, so it is important to correct it.
According to the doctor, the first thing to do in treatment is to remove the cause that produces it and in the case of iron deficiency anemia, caused by blood loss, the first thing is to eliminate these bleeding and then treat anemia with iron. The same is true of other anemias, to be offset in accordance with each deficiency.
Whatever the cause, treatment specialist should meet, and in the case of iron deficiency anemia, iron continues to take three or four months after correction of anemia, to fill the bone marrow stores of iron. With this in mind, the most important is to go to the doctor and he shall of the best recommendations in each case.

Healthcare, The Basic Human Right
With the inception of the civilized society in medieval age, the laws about the formation of human rights were started being legislated. With the lapse of time, Messengers of God endorsed the human made laws with the divine laws. In the end, the basic human rights were defined and implemented. All the laws in every country have been derived from these struggles of the early societies.
Healthcare is now being perceived the basic human right and the jobs related with this field is being given higher value and importance. When you would be healthy then all the other works would be done. So without health, human beings are helpless in playing their roles individually or collectively for the betterment of a society. The developed countries are giving special attention towards the provision of this basic human right to their all citizens irrespective of their age, gender, race or origin.
All the human beings in a society should be treated equally for their basic human rights and no stone should be turned left in giving such rights to them at their home thresholds. This is the reason that the jobs in healthcare department are the most valued jobs. People with the sense of serving humanity may suit best for these jobs. The hiring companies or government should be unbiased.

Quick and Easy Ways To Naturally Prevent and Treat Colds, The Flu and Sinusitis
Posted on February 27, 2012 by admin Comments Off
When flu time arrives, we’re besieged with the pressure of whether or not to get the flu shot. If you find yourself wondering if there are any real alternatives out there, then this article is for you.
Homeopathic vaccinations are an attractive and highly effective alternative to conventional vaccinations. According to Dr. Isaac Golden (Head of the School of Holistic Medicine in Australia), homeopathic vaccinations have historically a 90% + success rate.
Homeopathic vaccines are normally taken sublingually (under the tongue) or in water, and the dosage contains a diluted yet potentized amount of the vaccine or remedy. This allows you to assimilate the remedy without shock or side effects. It triggers your body’s natural defense mechanism which begins to manufacture anti-bodies that in turn will combat the actual flu virus.
Keep in mind that no one system of vaccination can provide a 100% guarantee of protection – lifestyles and predisposition affects that.
If at any time you’re doubtful on what choice to make, research everything you can find on regular vaccines and natural alternatives, then go with your instinct – your mind has a powerful influence on your health – in the end you must do what resonates with you.
What To Take To Prevent The Flu:
1) Influenzinum, the homeopathic flu vaccine,is usually prescribed by homeopathic physicians during the course of flu season. The dosage is tailored for you based on your constitution and whether or not you you’re susceptible to catching colds and the flu. See a homeopath to get dosed or use Homeocoksinum or Oscillococcinum as a precaution
2) Take 2,000 mg of Vitamin C capsules daily (for adults). This will boost your immune system. Vitamin C has proven to be a powerful virus fighter. Children can take 500 mg of Vitamin C daily, especially during flu season.
3) Take 2,000 IU of Vitamin D daily for adults and 400 IU daily for children, especially if you live in areas which tend to get less sunshine during the winter months. South Asians in particular have more melanin levels which limits the body’s ability to produce Vitamin D3.
4) Drink 2-3 litres of plain water spread out over the day and add a pinch of sea salt to meals. This will help thin and flush out mucus and decrease sinus congestion as well as balancing cell integrity to keep your system healthy on a daily basis. If you don’t drink this recommended amount already, then increase your daily intake of drinking water very slowly until your kidneys have had a chance to catch up. As well, never drink a litre or more of water at one sitting. Coffee and alcohol are dehydrating, so enjoy in moderation and hydrate afterward!
5) Take daily multivitamins (both children and adults).
6) Make sure you get at least 8 hours sleep a night.
7) Do your best to keep your working hours (including computer, blackberry and iPhone time) limited to a healthy work-life balance.
What To Do if You Catch the Flu:
There are two over-the-counter homeopathic kits which are great to keep in your home health kit: Homeocoksinum or Oscillococcinum. They are good for both adults and children. They match general flu symptoms: aching, fever, headache, stiffness, shivers, cough, runny nose and congestion. These remedies have been proven to cut the flu short and lessen the symptom intensity if taken within the first 48 hours of symptoms.
1) Homeocoksinumor Oscillococcinum. Dose: The contents of 1/2 tube under the tongue, then repeat two to three times, 8 hours apart (so 1.5-2 tubes to be taken in total). Repeat the next day.
2) For children with nasal symptoms during the flu, use a natural nasal spray containing sea water, such as HydraSense mist. A 2008 study in the Czech Republic showed a significant improvement in flu nasal symptoms for children using such a spray.
3) Take 1,000 mg of Vitamin C every waking hour for the first 2 days (or until loose bowels are experienced), then wean down to 3,000 mg daily until the end of April. After April, wean back down to 2,000 mg a day and maintain at this dose.
4) Take plenty of liquids. Avoid anything with sugar, although fruits and hot water+honey+lemon is fine.
5) Ginger tea is excellent for boosting your immune system. Chop an inch or two of fresh ginger and heat it on High in a full saucepan of water. Once it boils, let it simmer for 10-15 minutes, then strain and drink as is or with some honey. Caution: It’s spicy!
Homeopathy works beautifully if you have already contracted the flu. There are many effective remedies such as Gelsemium for the classic flu when the weather changes. However as most people have slightly different symptoms other than the general symptoms, for best results it’s recommended to see a classical homeopath who will prescribe a remedy based on your full symptom picture. As well, continued homeopathic treatment will raise your defenses naturally, leading to less susceptibility and a healthier overall system over the years.
Where to find homeopathic flu vaccines:
Most homeopaths offer flu vaccines (along with travel and childhood disease vaccines). Look for a classical homeopath in your area and consider treating your family yearly. Homeokoksinum and Oscillococcsinum can be ordered online or picked up at most health stores.
Sinusitis (Sinus Infection and Inflammation):
It is very common for sinus sufferers to experience sinus congestion, inflammation and infections along with cold and flu symptoms. They can also be triggered by allergies and the infections may be either viral, bacterial or, more commonly as reported by The Mayo Clinic, fungal.
Some tips to keep your sinuses clear:
1) Follow the steps for preventing the flu above.
2) At the first sign of congestion, use a neti pot, Grossan sinus irrigator, Sinupulse irrigator or a saline flush like hydraSense or Neilmed to irrigate your nostrils. They are very effective when used right away.
As sinus symptoms are generally chronic and come back repeatedly, a homeopath can work with you to treat any underlying condition. If you aren’t able to locate a homeopath in your area, use my tips above and visit my website for more ideas.

Whooping cough breaks out in Wright Co.
Published by Lynda Jensen, Editor on April 27, 2010 in Cokato and News.
WRIGHT COUNTY, MN – Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, has been confirmed in more than 40 people in the Maple Lake area along with a few cases in Annandale and Monticello, according to Wright County Public Health.
Most of the diagnosed cases are in elementary school age children, but younger children and adults have been affected.
In recent years, more cases of pertussis have been reported in adults and children. Since pertussis may be milder in adults and older children, they can pass on the disease without knowing it. The risk to infants and elderly is the greatest, however, even in adolescents and adults a pertussis infection can lead to pneumonia or even rib fractures from coughing.
Pertussis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Droplets are produced in the air but don’t travel far. They usually only infect persons near by.
Pertussis usually starts out with symptoms similar to a cold, such as sneezing, cough, low-grade fever, and runny nose. A fever isn’t always present. The cough tends to be worse at night and over time can become severe lasting weeks or months.
Pertussis should be considered when:
• A cough illness occurs after a direct exposure to pertussis.
• A persistent cough of unknown origin lasts more than 7 days
• A violent cough occurs with a whooping sound, vomiting/gagging while coughing or inability to catch one’s breath while coughing
Persons with pertussis should stay home and not go to school, work, or attend other activities until they have finished 5 days of antibiotic treatment. Even with treatment the cough can continue for a long time. Treatment does not make the cough go away completely but will help prevent the spread of pertussis
Anyone who has been coughing for seven days or longer and has had contact with someone with pertussis should discuss pertussis with their medical provider
Most children have been vaccinated for pertussis, however, protection decreases over time. Studies have shown that the immunity from this particular vaccine decreases after 3-5 years from the last vaccination, which is usually given before kindergarten. Therefore, most adolescents and adults are at risk for pertussis
The current outbreak highlights the need for the Tdap booster vaccine in adults and adolescents. The Tdap vaccine is a combination of tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Current recommendations during an outbreak are to:
• Give Tdap to children ages 10-12 now instead of waiting until these children enter 7th grade when the next booster is due.
• Give Tdap to adolescents and adults up to age 64 who have not received a Tdap before and it has been 2 years since receiving Td (tetanus shot).
Currently there is no licensed pertussis vaccine for people 65 years and older
The Wright County WOW Van is making an extra stop in Maple Lake on April 30 from 1-4 pm in the parking area of St. Timothy’s Church.

Whooping CoughAlthough it's considered a vaccine-preventable disease, whooping cough (pertussis) certainly hasn't been eliminated as a public health problem. The incidence of whooping cough has decreased by more than 90% over the last 50 years, but there are still outbreaks. While most other diseases that are vaccinated against in childhood are decreasing in frequency, cases of whooping cough have actually increased since 1990. This is likely due to the lower effectiveness of older vaccines (due to the emergence of new strains of the disease), decreased protection from the disease (immunity) in adults and adolescents as the effect of the vaccine wears off, and increased reporting of whooping cough by doctors.
About 2,000 to 10,000 cases a year have been reported in Canada over the last 10 years. In Canada, 1 to 3 Canadians die each year from whooping cough. In unvaccinated populations, most cases occur in children under 5, especially in babies less than 6 months old. Because the effects of the vaccination wear off, adults are also susceptible to the disease.
Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The bacterium is transmitted in tiny droplets that come from the nose and mouth and is spread from person to person. A similar bacterium called Bordetella parapertussis causes a milder version of whooping cough known as parapertussis.
While most cases of pertussis occur in children under 5 years, it may be that the majority of carriers are older. It's now believed that adults are a major source of infection to infants.
Since many people reach adulthood without having been infected, it's entirely possible for adults to develop whooping cough. One Canadian study concluded that between 10% and 20% of coughs in adults and adolescents that last 7 days or more are caused by pertussis. After infants, the people most likely to suffer serious complications from whooping cough are seniors and those with chronic ill health.
The disease takes 1 or 2 weeks to incubate. People become infectious to others by the end of the first week and they typically remain contagious for about 6 weeks. The disease is highly contagious and you will be advised to avoid contact with others while you are still able to infect people.
The disease has 3 stages. The first stage begins about 10 days after infection and causes symptoms like a common cold - sneezing, watery eyes, tiredness, and loss of appetite. There's also a dry hacking cough.
The second stage occurs after 10 to 14 days and is signalled by a rapid increase in the frequency and severity of coughing. It's this cough that gives the disease its name. Half a dozen or more rapid coughs follow each other in quick succession, followed by a ""whooping"" sound as the person inhales deep and fast. It may happen hundreds of times in a single day. The coughing may produce large amounts of thick mucus. Sometimes infants swallow it, but it may exit through the nostrils, often forming bubbles. Frequent coughing and mucus can cause vomiting, and choking is a risk in infants. Infants are actually less likely to make the whooping sound than are older children or adults, but they're more likely to have a choking spell.
After a month, most people start to look and feel better and cough less. This is the third stage - a gradual recovery taking a few weeks or occasionally a few months. The usual total course of the disease lasts 6 to 10 weeks.
The risk of complications is highest in infants under one year old. There's also potential danger to seniors and those with chronic ill health. The most common complication in children is otitis media, a middle ear infection. Other complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), seizures, apnea (brief periods when breathing stops), and hemorrhages (bleeding) in the eye.
Whooping cough is usually easy to diagnose. A cotton swab on the end of a wire is inserted through the nostril into the nasopharynx (the breathing tube behind the nose), and then cultured to look for bacteria. Most of the time, the bacteria will show up on this test. This means a few cases won't be diagnosable in the early stages, but once it gets to the second stage, the symptoms will make the nature of the condition obvious. In some cases, the disease runs a milder course and the later symptoms do not develop. People who have been immunized can still get whooping cough, but they will have much milder symptoms. Chest X-rays may also be taken to check for the presence of fluid or mucus in the lungs.
Although bacteria cause whooping cough, antibiotics aren't especially effective in treating it unless they're given in the first stage. Very often, the disease isn't recognized until it enters the second stage. Nevertheless, antibiotics such as erythromycin*, clarithromycin, azithromycin, or sulfamethoxazole - trimethoprim are given at this stage to reduce the possibility of complications, even if they don't cut the duration of the whooping cough itself.
Infants with pertussis are often hospitalized, especially those less than 6 months of age. Treatment is designed to minimize symptoms and the damage those symptoms can cause. In the case of heavy vomiting, fluids and electrolytes (e.g., potassium) must be replaced intravenously. In babies, it may be necessary to suck out mucus with a vacuum-like device or to install a nasal breathing tube to help breathing. Extra oxygen may also be necessary. Expectorant and cough-suppressing medications are generally not recommended. Babies with pertussis should be left to sleep as much as possible, since any disturbance or excitement is likely to trigger coughing. In older children, symptoms and risks are much milder, and hospitalization is hardly ever needed.
Most people know there's a vaccine against whooping cough; however, too many people know about it for the wrong reasons. Antivaccine groups and the media have focused on a one-in-a-million chance of encephalitis (severe brain inflammation) occurring in the hours or days after the vaccination, while not addressing the far larger risk of encephalitis caused by whooping cough in unvaccinated people.
The last sizeable Canadian outbreak of pertussis, in New Brunswick in 1998, was overwhelmingly concentrated in the 5 to 14 age group. This was a clear sign that vaccinations were allowed to lapse, because vaccinations given in infancy would have worn off by these ages.
The Canadian pertussis vaccination schedule is as follows: babies are given the DPT (diphtheria - pertussis - tetanus) vaccine at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months of age to establish basic immunity. They are then given boosters at 18 months and at 4 to 6 years of age. The last booster should cover them to about age 14 to 16, when they are given the new whooping cough vaccine (see below) combined with the adult diphtheria - tetanus formulation. The first 5 shots (from 2 months to 4 to 6 years) will usually be given in conjunction with polio vaccine and Hemophilus influenzae B or ""Hib"" vaccine (an antipneumonia vaccine), since these have the same schedule as DPT. Additional immunizations are given with some of these first 5 shots, with the exact schedule determined by the province.
In the late 90's, a new pertussis vaccine that didn't contain whole killed Bordetella pertussis cells was introduced in Canada. The new vaccine is known as DTaP (""a"" stands for acellular), while the old one is called DTwP (""w"" is for whole). The new shot is even less likely to cause severe reactions than the old one. Because of recent evidence that many infants catch pertussis from adults, aP (acellular pertussis vaccine) is now available in a combined adult diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis shot.

Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis).
Altunaiji S, Kukuruzovic R, Curtis N, Massie J
Zayed Military Hospital, Zayed Street, PO Box 3740, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. saltunaiji@hotmail.com
BACKGROUND: Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.

What is whooping cough (pertussis)?
Whooping cough, or pertussis, mainly affects infants and young children. Caused by a bacterium, it is characterized by paroxysms (intense fits or spells) of coughing that end with the characteristic whoop as air is inhaled. Whooping cough caused thousands of deaths in the 1930s and 1940s, but, with the advent of a vaccine, the rate of death has declined dramatically.
What are the symptoms of whooping cough?
The disease usually takes one to three weeks to incubate. The following are the most common symptoms of whooping cough. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
coughing
sneezing
nasal discharge
fever
sore, watery eyes
whooping
lips, tongue, and nailbeds may turn blue during coughing spells
Whooping cough can last up to 10 weeks and can lead to pneumonia.
The symptoms of whooping cough may resemble other medical conditions. Always consult your physician for a diagnosis.
How is whooping cough diagnosed?
In addition to a complete medical history and medical examination, diagnosis of whooping cough is often confirmed with a culture taken from the nose.
Treatment for whooping cough:
Specific treatment for whooping cough will be determined by your physician based on:
your overall health and medical history
extent of the condition
your tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
expectations for the course of the condition
your opinion or preference
Antibiotics are generally not helpful once severe coughing has begun but does help to prevent the spread of infection after 3 to 4 days of treatment. Other treatment may include:
keeping warm
eating small, frequent meals
drinking plenty of fluids
reducing stimuli that may provoke coughing
Hospitalization may be required in severe cases.
Preventing whooping cough:
Although a vaccine has been developed against whooping cough, which is routinely given to children in the first year of life, cases of the disease still occur, especially in infants younger than 6 months of age.

Ear
Infections Resist Common Antibiotics
Stanford University
researchers have documented the first cases of chronic
ear infections with antibiotic-resistant strep.
""It has been known
that this pathogen was present in acute cases of otitis
media.... but this is the first study to isolate cases in
children with chronic ear effusions (fluid),"" said
Dr. Patrick Fitzgerald, who presented his findings
yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Academy
of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in San Francisco.
In the study,
Fitzgerald and his colleagues examined discharge from the
middle ears of 49 young children who had chronic otitis
media, or chronic middle ear infections.
hey found that 23 of
the 49 contained bacteria. Five of those were
streptococcus pneumoniae; two of those were resistant to
penicillin and most other antibiotics commonly used to
treat otitis media.
If untreated, chronic
otitis media can lead to hearing loss and delayed speech
Streptococcus
pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia,
necrotizing fasciitis (the so-called flesh-eating
bacteria) and strep throat, as well as middle ear infections.
Fitzgerald said there are about 7 million cases of acute
middle ear infections each year in the United States,
about 2 million to 3 million of which are caused by
streptococcus pneumoniae.
Reports have found as
many as one-quarter of acute strep infections resistant
to penicillin and other antibiotics.

Introduction
The 15th Asia-Pacific Congress on Diseases of the Chest (APCDC) was recently held in Manila, where issues affecting the optimal management of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) were discussed. A great deal of emphasis was placed on the burden of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) which was described as a ""continuing threat despite the best efforts of medical practitioners, researchers and laboratory investigators"". With the growing resistance to many agents, it has become imperative that treatment guidelines are prepared that help physicians define which drug(s) to use, and the optimal administration schedule. As well as symposia and scientific sessions focusing upon this topic, a large number of poster sessions presented new data of particular relevance to Asian countries. A common theme to emerge from the meeting was the important role of new fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, in counterattacking the threat of growing resistance. The following paper reports on the highlights of the meeting, focusing on the role of levofloxacin in treating lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).
A symposium focusing on the need for evidence-based treatment of LRTIs was held with three world-renowned speakers under the chair of Prof. Maria B. Siasoco, Philippine General Hospital, University of the Philippines, Metro Manila, Philippines. Pharmacological analysis, which is important in developing optimal treatment strategies, was outlined by Prof. Charles H. Nightingale, Hartford Hospital, University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, Hartford, CT, USA. This was followed by the latest international resistance surveillance results from Dr. Clyde Thornsberry, MRL Pharmaceutical Services, Brentwood, TN, USA. A clear-cut update on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Guidelines for treatment of CAP was then presented by Prof. John G. Bartlett, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.
High AUC/MIC Ratio for Levofloxacin
Pharmacological factors which are now recognized as important indicators of efficacy include a ratio for the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) greater than 100 for Gram-negative organisms and greater than 30 for Gram-positive pathogens. With this in mind, it was clearly demonstrated that levofloxacin possesses extremely advantageous pharmacological features, as it achieves an AUC/MIC against Streptococcus pneumoniae above this threshold of 30, 99% of the time. Further validation of the pharmacological benefits provided by levofloxacin were presented by Prof. Nightingale, who reported results from his own study utilizing 933 real patients (rather than volunteers) and using a Monte Carlo mathematical model. Ninety-two percent of patients had an AUC 51, and, in fact, 12% had an AUC 121. Results confirmed that the certainty of levofloxacin treatment achieving an AUC/MIC greater than 30 was 99% among patients at Hartford Hospital (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Probability distribution curve AUC/MIC for patients on levofloxacin. The certainty of achieving a AUC/MIC > 30 was shown to be 99%. Adapted from Grant EM, et al. Application of population pharmacokinetics and surveillance data to predict AUC/MIC ratios: a Monte Carlo analysis. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting 1999.
Cost-effectiveness issues are continuing to be raised, and with this in mind, Prof. Nightingale reported results from a study comparing the cost of treating a hospitalized patients with CAP for four days intravenously (IV) followed by two days oral (PO) therapy. This study compared the costs associated with azithromycin, cefuroxime axetil and erythromycin combination, and levofloxacin. When all costs were considered, taking into account the safety profile of the different agents, potential drug interactions, and the clinical success and failure rates, the study demonstrated that levofloxacin was the most cost-effective antibiotic to use in this situation (Figure 2). In contrast, the initially cheapest option of cefuroxime axetil and erythromycin combination was found to be the most costly when all factors were considered. It is extremely important that direct drug acquisition costs are not the sole tool for deciding which drug is the cheapest to use. All factors such as efficacy, drug interactions, failure rates and adverse drug reaction (ADR) rates need to be considered as well.

Results from an Ongoing International Surveillance Study
An international surveillance study was performed to assess the resistance patterns among S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with results reported by Dr. Thornsberry, showing marked variability worldwide. A total of 11,502 isolates were tested from nine countries, using microdilution susceptibility tests as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) Guidelines. Of these, 90% of M. catarrhalis isolates produced -lactamase, making it necessary for physicians to consider that, from a clinical perspective, all strains of M. catarrhalis are resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin.
In contrast, -lactamase production by H. influenzae ranged from 5.7% in Germany to 34.5% in the US. All isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were susceptible to levofloxacin. Ampicillin resistance among H. influenzae ranged from 5.8% in China to 34.8% in the US. Trimethoprim-sulfamathoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistance ranged from 17.2% in France to 52.9% in Brazil (mean 29.7%).
Enormous differences between countries in the incidence of penicillin resistance were demonstrated. In regard to S. pneumoniae, the mean global incidence of penicillin resistance was 33%, ranging from 7.8% in Germany to 66.5% in France (Table 1). It was emphasized that penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae was associated with resistance to other -lactams, macrolides and sulphonamides, but not to levofloxacin or vancomycin.
Fluoroquinolone Resistance Extremely Low
When assessing fluoroquinolone resistance, the study focused on levofloxacin, an agent
which has been widely used in Japan since 1993 with only minimal resistance developing
in S. pneumoniae. One reason for this includes the need for two mutations to confer high-
level resistance.
An Algorithm for Managing CAP
The latest IDSA Guidelines for the management of CAP were presented by Prof. Bartlett. He drew on his wealth of clinical experience to describe a clear management strategy for dealing with a patient who presents with what appears to be an LRTIs. The first step is to make a diagnosis and, in this regard, the importance of the chest X-ray (CXR) is paramount. This not only aids the diagnosis of CAP, but also differentiates this disease from acute bronchitis, a predominantly viral disorder which is associated with a vast amount of over-treatment. The decision for hospitalization should be based on social factors and evaluation of severity of illness. Identification of an etiologic agent for inpatients should include two pretreatment blood cultures, one pretreatment sputum specimen, and seriously ill patients require testing for Legionella spp. Therapy needs to be initiated as soon as possible. An analysis of 14,069 patients demonstrated that survival is influenced by the time interval from patient presentation for health care until they receive their first dose of antibiotic (Figure 3). If this is delayed for more than 8 hours, there is a statistically significant increase in mortality.

Latest IDSA Guidelines for CAP
Therapy for known etiological agent
When treating an infection caused by S. pneumoniae with a penicillin MIC < 2 µg/ml the oral -lactams of choice are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, cefprozil and cefpodoxime. Parenteral -lactams should include penicillin (or ampicillin, or piperacillin, but not ticarcillin), cefuroxime axetil, although this is marginal, and cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. Other agents which could be used include imipenem, fluoroquinolones, and the macrolides, doxycycline and clindamycin although their activity can be variable.
When treating penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (MIC > 2 µg/ml) the best choices are fluoroquinolones or possibly vancomycin. However, vancomycin is recommended with caution given the fact that the experience in using this agent in RTIs is limited.
Empiric management of CAP
For the empiric treatment of patients who present with suspected pneumonia and who do not require hospitalization, the following agents, in no order of preference, are recommended (Table 2): Doxycycline, or macrolides, or a fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against the pneumococcus (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin).
For empiric management of inpatients, a -lactam plus a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone alone is recommended.
If the patient is critically ill and requires hospitalization in the ICU, the recommendation is for a -lactam plus a macrolide or a -lactam plus a fluoroquinolone. Very recent work is now available which does point toward a recognition that fluoroquinolones will also be useful as single agents in ICU patients.
Prediction model for identification of patient risk for persons with community-acquired pneumonia.
This model may be used to help guide the initial decision on site of care; however, its use may not be appropriate for all patients with this illness and therefore should be applied in conjunction with physician judgement.
Adapted from Fine MJ, et al. A prediction rule to identify low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia. N Engl J Med 1997; 336: 243-50.
Prof. Bartlett commented that the latest IDSA Guidelines recommend that fluoroquinolones be used for both outpatients and hospitalized patients. The justification for this recommendation is based upon a number of important benefits provided by fluoroquinolones, as they have been demonstrated to have good activity against the major pulmonary pathogens including pneumococcus, H. influenzae and atypical strains. There are data available from clinical trials to support this choice. In addition, the drugs have a low toxicity profile and can be administered in a very convenient schedule, utilizing both oral and parenteral formulations in a once-daily regimen.

Case 5
Michael P. D'Alessandro, M.D.
Peer Review Status: Internally Peer Reviewed
Chief Complaint:
Fourteen year old male with a complicated pneumonia
Clinical History:
The patient was a 14 year old male who was diagnosed with a right
lower lobe pneumonia that initially was non responsive to oral
antibiotics. He was subsequently hospitalized at an outside hospital,
where he developed an empyema and was non responsive to IV
antibiotics and the placement of a pigtail catheter for empyema
drainage. He was transferred to our institution where a large bore
chest tube was surgically placed for empyema drainage and new IV
antibiotics were started.
Clinical Physical Exam:
The patient was febrile.
Clinical Labs:
Non-contributory
Clinical Differential Diagnosis:
Empyema, lung abscess
Imaging Findings:
A chest CT exam was obtained to better evaluate the nature of the
patient's complicated pneumonia.
Image 1
Images 2 and 3
Imaging Differential Diagnosis:
Empyema with lung abscess and bronchopleural fistula
Operative Findings:
None
Pathological Findings:
None
Final Diagnosis:
Lung Abscess, Empyema, Bronchopleural Fistula
Follow-up and Prognosis:
The chest tube was removed so that the bronchopleural fistula would
not progress. A repeat spiral chest CT exam obtained 3 weeks later
(not provided) showed substantial improvement of the disease in the
right hemithorax, with the bronchopleural fistula being no longer
demonstrated.

Pneumonia and Its Treatment
By: Mark Monteiro
Total Views: 290, Word Count: 863,
Pneumonia is a lung infection caused by various microorganisms like bacteria, viruses and fungi. Its alternative names are Bronchopneumonia and Community-acquired pneumonia.
If body resistance is down then microorganisms freely spread into the lungs and lungs air sacs .The infectious agent fill the latter with fluid and pus, worsening the condition of the affected person. People who have recently suffered from viral infections, heart problems, swallowing problems, lung diseases, drug addicts alcoholics are likely to catch Pneumonia more easily than others.
In some cases of Pneumonia, droplets containing Pneumonia causing organisms are breathed in. When an infected person coughs/sneezes these droplets get into the air. In other cases Pneumonia is caused when bacteria/viruses already present in mouth/nose/throat enter the lung. If diagnosed in time it can be easily treated.
Types of Pneumonia-
Bacterial Pneumonia-When body’s immunity is weakened, Pneumonia causing bacteria in throats can multiply, entering into lungs, inflaming air sacs, filling lungs with fluid and pus.
Viral Pneumonia-Viruses like influenza enter lungs and multiply.
Mycoplasmal Pneumonia-Mycoplasmas multiply and spread, causing infection.
Some other Pneumonia related disorders are:
Aspiration Pneumonia,
Chlamydial Pneumonia,
Loffler’s syndrome,
Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia,
Pediatric pneumonia,
Necrotizing pneumonia.
Symptoms of pneumonia-
Cough(greenish/yellow mucus),at times bloody sputum occurs
Piercing chest pain
Fever with shaking chills
Shallow, rapid breathing
Shortness of breath
At times headache, appetite loss, excessive fatigue, sweating and cyanosis are also witnessed. In case of children and babies any particular signs of chest infection are not obsevered but fever and lethargy are noticed.
Diagnosis of pneumonia-
Pneumonia is diagnosed by physical examination. When stethoscope is placed on chest, crackling sound is heard with wheezing/coarse breathing. Chest X-ray, sputum gram stain, blood test may be prescribed. The chest X-ray may show a blotchy –white area as a result of accumulation of fluid and pus in lung’s air sacs. The cause and severity of condition are determined by sputum gram stain and blood test.
If no conclusion can be drawn from the above given tests, bronchoscopy may be performed in which local anesthesia is given and a thin, flexible tube is inserted into nose/mouth of the affected person. Then doctor can directly examine the breathing passages and specimens from the infected part can be obtained.
Treatment of Pneumonia-
In most cases Pneumonia is a short-term, treatable illness but its frequent occurrences can make situation complicated.
Antibiotics are used to treat Pneumonia caused by bacteria which most commonly causes Pneumonia. The antibiotic prescribed is based on one’s general health, age and severity of Pneumonia. Generally improvement is seen in 2 to 3 days but if condition deteriorates, culture and sensitivity testing is required which helps in identifying the symptom causing organism.
In case of Viral Pneumonia there is no proven medicine for it. The only treatment is rest and taking care of one’s cough.
Varicella Pneumonia which is rare could be treated with an antiviral medicine.
If antibiotics are taken at ripe time, it results in quick recovery. If one needs to go to the hospital, probably some additional testing will be done to identify the bacteria.
Prevention of Pneumonia-
Quit smoking
Avoiding contact with people having cold and flu
If one has not suffered from measles/chicken pox or not had vaccination done against them, he should avoid contact with infected people Pneumonia can be a complication of the above two diseases, catching these infections may be dangerous.
Washing hands frequently
Every disease has its own causes, symptoms and severity but if the causes are known and symptoms recognized, if people are aware with it, many serious situations can be avoided. Similarly, Pneumonia and its treatment would not be a problem if people are completely aware of it.

BACKGROUND: Recommendations for diagnostic testing in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia remain controversial. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a therapeutic strategy based on the microbiological results provided by urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. METHODS: For a 2-year period, hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive either empirical treatment, according to international guidelines, or targeted treatment, on the basis of the results from antigen tests. Outcome parameters, monetary costs and antibiotic exposure levels were compared. RESULTS: Out of 194 enrolled patients, 177 were available for randomisation; 89 were assigned to empirical treatment and 88 were assigned to targeted treatment. Targeted treatment was associated with a slightly higher overall cost (euro 1657.00 vs euro 1617.20, p=0.28), reduction in the incidence of adverse events (9% vs 18%, p=0.12) and lower exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials (154.4 vs 183.3 defined daily doses per 100 patient days). No statistically significant differences in other outcome parameters were observed. Oral antibiotic treatment was started according to the results of antigen tests in 25 patients assigned to targeted treatment; these patients showed a statistically significant higher risk of clinical relapse as compared with the remaining population (12% vs 3%, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The routine implementation of urine antigen detection tests does not carry substantial outcome-related or economic benefits to hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Narrowing the antibiotic treatment according to the urine antigen results may in fact be associated with a higher risk of clinical relapse.

Pneumococcus Strain Resistant To All Kids' Antibiotics

2010
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 16 -- A strain of pneumococcus resistant to all of the antibiotics approved for use in children has emerged in the wake of the widespread use of the heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine, researchers here said.
The pathogen -- serotype 19A of Streptococcus pneumoniae -- was isolated from nine children in a single pediatric practice here over a three-year period, according to Michael Pichichero, M.D., and Janet Casey, M.D., of the University of Rochester.
The 19A serotype is not included in the current pneumococcal vaccine, and has previously been reported to have caused disease among Native Alaskan children, they noted in the Oct. 17 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
But the pathogens seen in Alaska were not multi-drug resistant, Drs. Pichichero and Casey said. (See: Pneumococcal Disease Rebounding in Alaskan Native Children)
In the nine cases they found -- two in the respiratory season from September 2003 through June 2004, two in 2004-2005 season, and five in 2005-2006 season -- the first four required a tympanostomy tube insertion after a series of unsuccessful antibiotic therapies, including high-dose amoxicillin (Amoxil), amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), and ceftriaxone (Rocephin).
The last five were successfully treated with levofloxacin (Levaquin), an oral fluoroquinolone that is not approved for use in children, the researchers said.
While the numbers are small, the researchers said, the ""observations are clearly worrisome"" -- especially since no new antibiotics for children are in the late stages of testing.
The finding means that ""old diseases have learned new tricks"" and clinicians and public health authorities will need to work closely together in order to curb them, said Elizabeth Bancroft, M.D., of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, in an accompanying editorial.
The study ""highlights the importance of surveillance for antibiotic resistance and strain detection in a community setting,"" Dr. Bancroft said.
The emergence of the resistant serotype ""clearly bears watching,"" Blaise Congeni, M.D., of Akron Children's Hospital in Akron, Ohio, told MedPage Today, because treatment options are limited and the number of cases -- while small -- appears to be rising over time.
But, he added, ""I'm not overly alarmed by this (because) we still have options"" including drugs such as levofloxacin or tympanocentesis, aspirating infectious material from the ear.
Drs. Pichichero and Casey uncovered the nine cases from a prospective longitudinal investigation aimed at characterizing S. pneumoniae that caused acute otitis media in children.
All told, 1,816 children were seen for acute otitis media over the three-year study; all of them had been given the pneumococcal vaccine. The researchers focused on 375 who had a first or second episode of acute otitis media, recurrent disease, or acute otitis media with treatment failure.
For the 375 children, Drs. Pichichero and Casey performed tympanocentesis 212 times, and were successful in culturing a pathogen in 162 cases, of which 59 were S. pneumoniae.
Over the study period, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes fell significantly -- from 16 of 28 (or 57%) in the 2003-2004 season to five of 19 (or 26%) in the 2005-2006 season.
At the same time, the proportion of non-vaccine serotypes rose significantly from 12 of 28 (or 43%) at the start of the study to 14 of 19 (or 74%) at the end.

Cochrane Collaboration cockeyed on valerian
Here is a great example of the depths of futile stupidity that modern meta-analysis can reach sometimes. Valerian, known for many centuries as a calming herb apparently lacks evidence for efficacy in “anxiety disorders”. That is mainly because the reviewers could only find ONE trial (n=36) that met their criteria. The banality of the exercise is hard to credit…
Of course, although Cochrane was one of the original proponents of RCTs, and later of systematic reviews, he was not stupid. The so called Cochrane collaboration was established several years after he passed away in 1993. Cochrane was an alum of my old school - King’s College Cambridge, and was, typically for King’s, a leftie. After graduating medical school he went to fight against Franco in the Spanish Civil War and later did most of his doctoring as a POW in various camps during WW2 after being captured. Links to his biography are available on the Cochrane collaboration site. Anyway, poor old Archie Cochrane would be turning in his grave if he knew what was going on his name…
Miyasaka L, Atallah A, Soares B Valerian for anxiety disorders. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006;(4):CD004515
BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are very common mental health problems in the general population and in primary care settings. Herbal medicines are popular and used worldwide and mght be considered as a treatment option for anxiety if shown to be effective and safe. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of valerian for treating anxiety disorders. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) searched on 04/08/2006, MEDLINE, Lilacs. References of all identified studies were inspected for additional studies. First authors of each included study, manufacturers of valerian products, and experts in the field were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of valerian extract of any dose, regime, or method of administration, for people with any primary diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, chronic anxiety status, or any other disorder in which anxiety is the primary symptom (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, other types of phobia, postraumatic stress disorder). Effectiveness was measured using clinical outcome measures and other scales for anxiety symptoms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria, extracted and entered data, and performed the trial quality assessments. Where disagreements occured, the third review author was consulted. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using Cochrane Handbook criteria. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) was calculated, and for continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated, with their respective 95% confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: One RCT involving 36 patients wih generalised anxiety disorder was eligible for inclusion. This was a 4 week pilot study of valerian, diazepam and placebo. There were no significant differences between the valerian and placebo groups in HAM-A total scores, or in somatic and psychic factor scores. Similarly, there were no significant differences in HAM-A scores between the valerian and diazepam groups, although based on STAI-Trait scores, significantly greater symptom improvement was indicated in the diazepam group. There were no significant differences between the three groups in the number of patients reporting side effects or in dropout rates. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS: Since only one small study is currently available, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of valerian compared with placebo or diazepam for anxiety disorders. RCTs involving larger samples and comparing valerian with placebo or other interventions used to treat of anxiety disorders, such as antidepressants, are needed.PMID: 17054208 [PubMed - in process]

This health article is part four of four installments of our herbal supplements encyclopedia. Please see the bottom of this page for links to the other encyclopedia health article sections.
Saw Palmetto
This botanical product is derived from a small palm tree found in South Carolina and Florida. Over the last few years saw palmetto has gained notoriety for its beneficial effects on a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia, a benign (non-cancerous) growth within the prostate gland. Also referred to as enlargement of the prostate, this condition is common in men age 50 and older. The male hormone testosterone is converted into a chemical called DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which seems to play a part in causing the prostate to become enlarged. Saw Palmetto has been found to inhibit this action. It’s effect on DHT has also recently made saw palmetto a popular natural treatment for hair loss.
Silymarin (Milk Thistle)
Silymarin (milk thistle) is an herb generally used to protect the liver from a variety of toxic substances. It prevents toxins from penetrating the interior of liver cells while promoting the growth of healthy new cells to repair liver damage. Milk thistle seed has demonstrated significant value in the treatment of hepatitis, cirrhosis, inflammatory liver disease and liver damage from toxic substances. It has also been used as an antidote for death-cap mushroom poisoning, and has antioxidant properties.
Slippery Elm
Slippery elm is taken orally for stomach inflammation, ulcers and sore throat. Applied to the skin it can be used as a treatment for wounds, burns and skin conditions. For much of the 20th century, slippery elm was a popular over-the-counter remedy for sore throat and upset stomach. It was listed in The United States Pharmacopoeia until 1960, and was declared safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration, disappearing from drug store shelves only after Dutch elm disease destroyed nearly all the elm trees in the US. The powdered inner bark of the tree provides relief by forming a slippery, viscous coating that soothes irritation in the throat and the lining of the stomach. Its water-retaining properties also make it an ideal ingredient for a soothing compress.
St. John’s Wort
Sometimes referred to as “Nature’s Prozac,” St. John’s wort is believed to combat depression by boosting the levels of certain chemical messengers in the brain. It works on two levels: Like the prescription antidepressant Prozac, it seems to increase the amount of serotonin available to the nervous system. And like the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor Nardil, St. John’s wort is thought to promote higher levels of dopamine and certain other chemical messengers.
St. John’s wort has also been used to treat sleep disturbances, gallbladder disorders, gastritis, bronchitis, asthma, diarrhea, bed-wetting, rheumatism, muscle pain, hemorrhoids and gout. Researchers are currently studying its use in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
Cut at the start of the flowering season and processed in bunches, St. John’s wort must be dried quickly to preserve its oil and secretions. Early Christians named the plant in honor of St. John the Baptist because they believed the plant secreted its blood-red oil each year on Aug. 29, the day the saint was beheaded. Used medicinally for over 2000 years, Ancient Greeks believed that the odor of St. John’s wort repelled evil spirits. St. John’s wort is also known as amber, goat weed, hardhay, klamath weed and tipton weed.
Excessive use of St. John’s wort increases sensitivity to sunlight. To avoid sunburn, minimize your exposure to the sun while using this medication. This herb can also cause bloating and constipation.
Do not use St. John’s wort while taking a prescription MAO inhibitor, such as Nardil or Parnate, as a dangerous interaction may be possible. Avoid aged, pickled and fermented food and beverages while taking St. John’s wort. Foods such as aged cheese, wine and beer contain tyramine, which was formerly used to treat abnormally low blood pressure. The combination of St. John’s wort and these foods could cause a sudden, dangerous surge in blood pressure. Additionally, St. John’s wort should not be used by anyone with hypertension or borderline hypertension, as it can increase blood pressure.
Most recently, research indicates St. John’s wort lessens the effectiveness of indinavir, a medication given to HIV patients, and of the drug cyclosporin, which is used to suppress the immune systems of heart transplant patients so their bodies don’t reject the new organ.
Turmeric
Turmeric is a major ingredient in curry powder and is also used in certain varieties of mustard. Its active ingredient, curcumin, is prescribed as an anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of numerous disorders, including jaundice, bruises, chest pain and menstrual difficulties. Although medical evidence does not support its use in all these ailments, turmeric does appear to be an effective antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agent, and it may aid heart, liver and gastrointestinal problems.
Valerian
The odor of valerian has been likened to dirty gym socks, but this herb is a powerful remedy for spasms — it relaxes muscles and has a sedative effect. Valerian is also commonly taken for anxiety, mental strain, lack of concentration, excitability, hysteria, stress, headache, epilepsy, premenstrual syndrome, symptoms of menopause, nerve pain, fainting, stomach cramps and colic.
This plant, which produces bright pink to white flowers, grows 20 to 40 inches in height. It is native to Europe and the temperate regions of Asia, and is cultivated in Europe, Japan and the US. Valerian’s medicinal value comes from the underground stem and the roots.
Check with your doctor before using valerian extract or its volatile oil if you have a skin injury, an acute skin disorder, a severe infection, heart problems or severe muscle tension. In rare instances, valerian can cause digestive problems or an allergic reaction. Long-term use can lead to headache, restlessness, sleeplessness, pupil dilation and heart problems.
White Willow Bark
White willow bark (Salix alba) has been used for centuries to reduce fever, alleviate headaches and reduce pain and swelling in the joints. The discovery of the salicin nutrient in white willow bark led to the synthesis of today’s modern aspirin compound, which contains acetylsalicylic acid. Unlike aspirin, however, which can cause stomach irritation and even ulceration, white willow bark contains bioactive nutrients that are good for the digestive system. White willow bark is generally considered a relatively effective aspirin substitute.
Wild Yam (Dioscorea villosa)
Wild yam, a member of the Dioscorea family that includes the common potato, is considered a remedy for rheumatism, gallbladder problems, cramps, nerve pain, painful menstruation, upset stomach and morning sickness, although its effectiveness is unconfirmed. An extract of wild yam, however, has been shown to lower triglycerides and raise levels of the “good” HDL cholesterol that combats build-up of plaque in the arteries. Wild yam also calms muscular spasms, stimulates the flow of bile, promotes perspiration and seems to have anti-inflammatory properties.
Also known as China root, colic root, devil’s bones, rheumatism root and yuma, wild yam is used in the production of artificial progesterone. It does not, however, serve as a natural source of the female hormone progesterone. No known medical conditions preclude the use of wild yam, but take care to avoid excessive doses. Large doses have been known to cause nausea, and poisoning is conceivable.
Yohimbe
Yohimbe is an herbal nutrient that may get your blood pumping because of the natural component of yohimbe bark and yohimbe powder — hydrochloride. Pure yohimbe hydrochloride has been used in the medical profession for a number of years to treat male impotence. In its action as an “alpha adrenergic agonist” it appears to increase the flow of blood to the penis, while at the same time preventing blood from flowing out.
Yucca
Yucca is currently used as a treatment for arthritis, although its effectiveness has not been officially recognized. Research suggests that yucca relieves arthritis by blocking intestinal release of toxins that inhibit normal formation of cartilage. Historically, Native Americans used yucca for sprains, sores, bleeding and inflammation. It has also been used as a shampoo to fight dandruff and hair loss.
Yucca, a desert plant related to the Joshua tree, grows primarily in the southwestern United States. The medicinal parts are the stalk and root. Yucca is an FDA-approved food additive used as a foaming agent in beverages such as root beer.
Yucca poses a theoretical danger to red blood cells because in test-tube studies, ingredients in yucca have caused the cells to burst (a process known as hemolysis). This problem, however, has never been reported in humans. Yucca is considered otherwise safe under all medical conditions, but large doses may cause loose stools.

FROM
KAREN:
QUESTION: I
am 21 years old. I have external hemorrhoids in
its early stages. I have so many fears that
they will get bigger even though am on the medicines for
about a week and no improvement so far. My doctor gave
me suppositories and told me to apply hot water mixed
with salt on my anus daily. Can I lift weights after I
have healed, and if so how long should I wait.
ANSWER: The weightlifting may have been the cause of
your problem in the first place. I don't know how much
weight you are lifting, but please be very careful and
make sure you are lifting correctly. Too much straining
can cause the hemorrhoids to grow larger. A simple
remedy is to make a compress of witch hazel extract. You
should be able to get this at the pharmacy. Put it in the
refrigerator so it stays cold. Put some on a cotton cloth
and apply directly to the area. It will be quite
shocking, but will help relieve the swelling and constrict
the veins. Also a salve made of St. John's Wort and
comfrey root would be very helpful. I don't know if you
have herbalists in Jordan, but if so, they should be able
to make this up for you.
FROM DAVID:
HEMORRHOIDS
Question:
I have had hemorrhoids for many years- It started when I was pregnant with my
second child. Used to be that it would come and go but for the last year or
so it is almost constant.
Answer: Hemorrhoids are a sign of prolapse in the body, prolapse of the tissues affected and others such as uterus, bladder, colon etc. Prolapse signs of the circulation system include, spidery veins, varicose veins, prolapse leads to stagnation in the body.
Prolapsed tissue needs corrected or it will only lead to other problems, such as what you are experiencing now.
What has changed in the past year or so, gained wieght, went on herbs, meds or supplements, problems with going to the bathroom, started lifting weights, changed to a sitting job, had multiple births, etc. Do you have any other signs of stagnation, swollen abdomen, breast, cystic diseases or vascular integrity loss, varicosity or spider veins?
The problem with treating symptomology is you (in general) are not getting rid of the cause.
But here is what has traditionally been used for symptom relief:
Get as many colorful fruits and vegetables in the diet, the dark blues, purples and reds help to increase vascular integrity.
More water is good, don't use chemical laxatives (herbal or otherwise) a stool softener used short term while you getting through this will help lessen grunting and forced muscular evacuation of bowels which help to create the hemorrhoids.
Have you tried sitz baths of astringent herbs such as Yarrow, Latin named: Achillea millefolium; Sage, Latin Named: Salvia officinalis; Bayberry, Latin Named: Myrica cerifera; Oak Bark (white, red, black), Latin Name: Quercus species, Q. alba, etc; Yellowroot, Latin Named: Xanthorrhiza simplicissima or Witch hazel, Latin Named: Hamamelis virginian. Witch Hazel combines nicely with Calendula for hemorrhoids. Witch Hazel is the main ingredient in Tucks. These herbs actually tighten the tissue and stop bleeding.
For an herbal sitz bath make a very very strong tea of the herb (strain well) then add it to bath tub or sitz bath tub and sit in it. I would try to do this several times a day.
You could add some flesh/tissue soothing and repairing herbs such as Fresh Plantain, Latin Name Plantago major (broad leaf plantain) or P. Lancelatta (Narrow leaf) a common yard weed, find a clean source no chemicals used on it (i.e. herbicides or insecticides) along with fresh or dry Calendula, Pot Marigold, Latin Named: Calendula officinalis which are specific for this condition also fresh Chickweed, Latin Name: Stellaria media
(The gathering tip above applies to all fresh wildcrafted herbs!)
Additionally teas made with the following have been known to help with prolapse:
Lady's Mantle, Latin Named: Alchemillia vulgaris, A. Mollis - good for hemorrhoids, spider veins, painful legs, urinary incontinence, pelvic fullness feeling, dysmennorhea or increased menstrual bleeding. Usually occurs if 3 or more births or multiple miscarriages or abortions have occurred this is not uncommon in women. For prolapsed uterus Raspberry leaf, Ladies mantle, Partridge berry and White pond lilly increase tonicity.
Sheperd's Purse, Latin Named: Capsella burse-pastoris for prolapsed uterus with heavy bleeding use with Lady's Mantle.
Raspberry Leaves, Latin Named: Rubus idaeus, are great herbal medicine for uterine tone, strengthens muscle integrity, helps bring it back into shape.
Figwort, Latin Named: Sacrophularia nodosa, S. marylandica useful for chronic swollen hemorrhoids, chronic stasis of blood such as hemorrhoids use with Horse chestnut, can be used orally and externally as a poultice for hemorrhoids.
Collinsonia, Stone root, Rich weed, Latin Named: Collinsonia canadensis
useful for recent hemorrhoids, within last year or so, for old hemorrhoids combine with Figwort and Horse Chestnut
White Pond Lily, Latin Named: Nymphaea odorata useful for pelvic tissue or organs that have lost tonicity and generally with prolapsed bladder, rectal, hemorrhoid (use internally and as a sitz bath) with Horse Chestnut, Figwort and Collinsonia
Horse Chestnut, Latin Named: Aesculus hippocastanum Great for venous congestion and stagnation with poor vascular integrity and tonicity, additionally good for hemorrhoids, varicosity's and rectal irritation. Use both topically and orally to strengthen capillaries, veins and arteries.
The Chinese herbs
Chi Hu \Ji Who\, Bupleurum, Latin Named: Bupleurum species such as B. chinensis, B.falcatum or B. scorzonerflorum used to maintain upright qi, used for prolapse with Codonopsis or Astragulus or Atractylodes (if excessive dampness), prolapsed rectum, bladder, hemorrhoids. Good Chinese herb
Dang shen, Codonopsis, Asian Bellflower, Latin Named: Codonopsis tangshen, C. pilosula used for collapsed or prolapsed hemorrhoids and additionally increases WBC and RBC production.
Huang Qi, Yellow Leader, Astragulus, Latin Named: Astragulus membrananceus (beware of Hediscarum being used as a substitute, there are other species) used for prolapse - hemorrhoids, uterus, rectum, bladder and additionally builds immune reservoir.
Xuan shen, purple majestic figwort, Latin Named: Scrophularia ningpoensis, S. murilandic, S. oldama useful for big, congested and bleeding hemorrhoids.",2012-03-15T10:32:41Z,http://www.herbnet.com/ask%20the%20herbalist/asktheherbalist_hemorrhoids.htm

Hemroids are an affliction that causes many individuals problems, and is more common than a lot of people believe. There are different cases of hemorrhoids that cause mild to severe pain. Mild cases, such as internal hemorrhoids are treated with over-the-counter internal hemorrhoid treatment solutions and could be prevented later on with changes to the diet for the most part. More severe cases, just like thrombosed external hemorrhoids will demand more invasive and sometimes more painful treatments.
It is sometimes a bit difficult to get a diagnosis in the first place. A hemorrhoid could be mistaken for an anal fissure or other rectal issue and should be first diagnosed by a doctor. Piles could show themselves internally or externally. They are referred to as external or internal hemroids and they are formed when too much pressure is put on the veins leading up to the rectum.
When hemorrhoids are internal and you can't see them it's difficult to treat the pain. You may find streaks of blood on the toilet paper after going to the restroom and not know the true source of the blood. Most of the time if it's bright red in color as well as stops bleeding immediately the cause is an internal hemorrhoid. It should be noted again that all rectal bleeding that's happening to you for the first time should be first examined by a doctor to be sure it's piles. Once you've a diagnosis of hemorrhoids usually the problem is not going to cause any major health conditions but will cause you annoying pain when you continue to experience them.Understand More About Some Reliable Hemorrhoid Treatment MethodsThe first step in most doctors' approach to hemorrhoid treatment is to suggest a high-fiber diet and bulking agents, such as Metamucil. Next, they typically suggest taking laxatives for constipation as part of the hemorrhoids treatment .Utilizing A Sitz Bath Can Be Extremely Efficient In The Treatment Of PilesYou have been working all day long and now your bottom just itches and burns. You can not stand the idea that you will have to suffer with your hemorrhoid problem another day so you start to think about what you can do right now to ease the swelling.Causes Of Hemorrhoids - 5 Of The Most Frequent Causes Of PilesWhat causes hemorrhoids is a common question asked by countless people afflicted with hemorrhoids. If you are one of these people, there can be a number of factors which contributed to your condition, to include:Why Venapro Hemorrhoid Formula Is The Best OptionDo you know what is hemorrhoid? Hemorrhoid is an infection that damages the anal opening and internal surfaces. The anal opening and internal surfaces are very delicate that's why the infections attack there should be treated as soon as possible. What happens when this infection attacks the humans?Apply Ointment Solutions For Hemorrhoids To Heal It ImmediatelyAs a matter of fact the hemorrhoid is the most dangerous and horrible infection that makes the patients worried about the health. In order to have the best remedies of this infection it is important to have the best remedies.You Will Require Much More That Symptoms Relief When Attempting To Permanently Treat HemroidsOn your list of favorite things to do, hemorrhoid treatment would be the last thing you would ever consider including, but if you've got piles, it can quickly become number one on your list of things to eliminate. Hemorrhoids are a chronic condition.A Short Introduction And Explanation Of Hemroid SurgeryUsually a hemorrhoid surgery procedure - also known as hemorrhoidectomy - is performed on patients who are dealing with severe or extreme formation of hemorrhoids. The concept of surgery always frightens everyone.

38,clueweb12-0000wb-83-30810,1,0,1,traction lower back pain,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,unhelpful,"Health Solutions, Dr. Naddaf, Doctor's Report, Special
Health SolutionsDr. Jamileh Naddaf, DC, FIAMA, PC
Special Doctors Report: THE SIMPLE DRX9000 “PAIN-FREE” TREATMENT FOR SEVERE LOWER BACK PAINLow back pain can have many causes. It is exceedingly frequent and is experienced at some time by up to 80% of the population. The differential diagnosis of low back pain is broad and includes systemic diseases (e.g. metastatic cancer), primary spine disease (e.g. disk herniation, degenerative arthritis) and regional diseases (e.g. aortic dissection) that refer pain to the low back. Treatment is often flawed, frequently painful, and can be exceedingly expensive.As demonstrated in the literature, the causes of mechanical low back pain probably include degenerative disc disease, degenerative spondylosis with limitation of range of motion, facet arthropy, relative lateral recess stenosis, pressure changes affecting the thecal and epidural space from disc bulging, subligamentous and/or extruded herniation and segmental instability. Any activity such as sitting, standing and/or lifting that increases axial loading on the spine will exacerbate low back pain.Anatomically, the spine consists of individual small bones called vertebrae that are stacked on top of one another to form a column. The cushion between each vertebra is called a disk. The problem with a disk is that it can pinch or irritate a nerve from the spinal cord resulting in pain that affects the legs (sciatica). Sciatica can be severe and disabling. If it persists longer than four weeks, worsens and there is no improvement, there is strong physiologic evidence of dysfunction of the spinal segment consisting of the intervertebral disc and its adjoining vertebrae.This condition needs to be confirmed at the corresponding level and side, by findings on an imaging study (MRI) and warrants an appropriate physician consultation. Primary disc pain can occur with mechanical strain of the annulus allowing nuclear herniations through radial fissures as well as from inflammation following trauma. A healthy disc could become painful if disease in other portions of the spine causes it to bear greater mechanical load and secondarily subject it to excessive strain. It is critical to realize that several mechanisms of causing pain may coexist and that similar disease processes give varying symptoms.But what type of therapy would be in order to return the patient to a functional level of activity without pain? Diagnostic/treatment variations imply a lack of consensus about appropriate assessment and treatment and suggest that these treatments sometimes are inappropriate or suboptimal. Some patients appear to be more disabled after treatment than before the treatment. Surgery versus conservative trial is the most obvious of such choices. However, surgery is not the only treatment that can lead to increased disability: Methods such as extended bed rest or use of high dose opiods can prolong symptoms and further debilitate patients; although the existing literature has shortcomings, there is sufficient evidence for a number of conclusions about the efficacy and safety of current assessment and treatment methods.The manipulative techniques, used for mechanical low-back pain associated with facet syndrome or muscle strain, have not been found to be as useful in the management of herniated or degenerative lumbar discs. Similarly, other modalities including ultrasound, electrical stimulation, short wave therapy, acupuncture, steroids, anti-inflammatory agents and muscle relaxants can fall short of treating underlying problems associated with intervertebral disc lesions.None of these methods relieve pain from neurocompression or from the stimuli associated with prolapsed nucleus pulposus. We reviewed studies on traditional traction that report less than 50% positive outcomes.Although the use of physical modalities in many forms are useful as adjunct therapy in the treatment of disc pathology they are largely empirical. Nachemson et al have comprehensively outlined changes in intradiscal pressures through various activities. They found that certain spinal motions and positions lower intradiscal pressures so that exercise programs and preventative ergonomic advice are fashioned after these principles.Research implies that raised intradiscal pressures, in a controlled manner, plays a role in disc lesions and now it is shown that lowering intradiscal pressures, in a controlled manner, plays a role in treating low back pain. New advances centering on the use of decompression, reduction and stabilization produced several important studies on the effect of decompression on intradiscal pressures.Effects of Intradiscal PressuresThe intervertebral disc and the two zygapophysial joints above and below, form a spinal segment with limited range of movement when isolated. Several spinal segments together, however, can produce large ranges of sagittal and coronal plane movement. The disc provides the main strength and stiffness and consists of a thick annular wall which attaches through cartilaginous plates to the vertebral bodies while the inner nucleus pulposus behaves hydrostatically as a viscous fluid changing shape in response to body position- in effect, acting like a joint.The nucleus receives axial loads and redistributes the load centripetally to the surrounding annulus, but aging reduces the vascularity of the outer annulus and cartilaginous plates to a few small vessels. The nucleus pulposus is held under tension within an envelope formed by the annulus and cartilage plates, but this envelope is not extensible and maintains turgor by the attraction of water to the proteoglycan macromolecules. Thus, nutrition to this inner nucleus is received by diffusion.Compared to the disc, the zygapophysial joints hold only 10-15% of the load while standing but much larger when flexed or lifting. In other words, they are the guiding and restricting segment during spinal motion and protect the disc from rotational and transitional strains. Thus, back pain may result when these fibrous capsules or synovial folds are irritated. The nucleus of the intervebral disc is contained under pressure and this is a useful index of function.Nachemson et al (""The lumbar spine: An orthopedic challenge, Spine 1975: ""Intravital dynamic pressure measurement of lumbar discs"", and ""Intervertebral disc pressure during traction"", Scand, Journal Rehab. Medicine Supplement, 1 and 9) and Ramos et al ""(Effects of vertebral axial decompression and intradiscal pressure"", Journal of Neurosurgery, 1994) have studied intradiscal pressures and have concluded that the ability of the disc to withstand comprehensive forces depends on both the integrity of the envelope and the turgor within; that movements such as flexion and lateral bending increase intradiscal pressure while resting pressures are lowest in supine and prone positions, lower in standing than sitting and very low in activities of lumbar extension and rotation. Exercise programs and ergonomic techniques emphasize the maintenance of a lordosis to maintain decreased pressures helps prevent injury, then a controlled decrease in pressure can directly treat injury.One of the best studies on intradiscal pressure was conducted by the Department of Neurosurgery and Radiology, Rio Grande Regional Hospital and Health Sciences Center, University of Texas. Intradiscal pressure measurement was performed by connecting a cannula inserted into the patients L4-5 disc space to a pressure transducer. The patient was placed in a prone position on a vertebral axial decompression therapeutic table and the tensionometer on the table was attached. Changes in pressure were recorded at resting state and while controlled tension was applied by the equipment. Intradiscal pressure demonstrated an inverse relationship to the tension applied and tension in the upper range was observed to decompress the nucleus pulposus significantly, to below -100 mm Hg.The results of this study indicated that it was possible to lower pressure in the nucleus pulposus of herniated lumbar discs to levels significantly below 0 mm Hg when distraction tension was applied according to the protocol described for the decompression therapy.In an outcome study of 778 patients, Gose et al (Vertebral axial decompression therapy for pain associated with herniation of degenerated discs or facet syndrome: An outcome study, Neurological Research, April 1998) found that decompression therapy was a primary treatment modality for low back pain associated with lumbar disc herniation at single or multiple levels, degenerative disc disease, facet arthropathy and decreased spine mobility; that pain, activity and mobility scores were all greatly improved after therapy.They demonstrated a success rate ranging from 68% for facet syndrome to 72% for multiple herniated discs and 73% for patients with a single herniated disc. The average successful outcome for all diagnoses was 71%. The authors have concluded that for patients with low back pain decompression therapy should be considered a front line treatment for degenerative spondylosis, facet syndrome, disc disease and nonsurgical lumbar radiculopathy.The DRX9000 Treatment ProgramMany doctor's research has shown that nutrition in the avascular disc depends on diffusion of collagen precursors, nutrients and oxygen though direct channels in the annulus (30%) and the hyaline end plate (70%) in the vertebrae above and below. It is estimated that the cycle of proline uptake and renewal on the normal disc takes approximately 500 days. This inherently slow cycle is additionally compromised in herniated or degenerative discs.By lowering the intradiscal pressures, the DRX9000 Program greatly facilitates this process and accelerates healing in the disc segment. Maximum clinical improvement occurs when treatment is delivered directly to the affected disc.With the DRX9000 Program, the treating physician can make adjustments in the angle of distraction, positioning of the spine and amounts of force necessary to unload, through distraction and positioning to create the effect of decompression at the specific intervertebral lumbar disc level.The FDA concluded that the DRX9000 achieves its effects through decompression of the intervertebral discs and facet joints, that is, unloading, due to distraction and positioning. Regular application of the DRX9000 treatments results in remodeling of shortened structures by applying end-range movement to the spine in a controlled manner. Mobilization of the hypomobile joint is used to restore motion.Limitations of the patient's motion depend on the irritability of the disorder. Decompressing the disc space through positioning of the patient promotes tissue healing, as evidenced through MRI documented reductions in the size and extent of herniations.Inclusion Criteria for the DRX9000The following would be inclusion criteria for the DRX9000: (1) Pain due to herniated and bulging lumbar discs that is more than four weeks old; (2) Recurrent pain from a failed back surgery that is more than six months old; (3) Persistent pain from degenerated discs not responding to four weeks of therapy; (4) Patients available for four weeks of treatment protocol; and (5) Patient at least 18 years of age.These indications are ideal candidates for enrollment into the DRX9000 program and have the potential to achieve quality outcomes in the treatment of their back pain: (1) Nerve Compression; (2) Lumbar Disorders; (3) Lumbar Strains; (4) Sciatic Neuralgia; (5) Herniated Discs; (6) Injury of the Lumbar Nerve Root; (7) Degenerative Discs; (8) Spinal Arthritis; (9) Low Back Pain w/ or w/o Sciatica; (10) Degenerative Joint Disease; (11) Myofasctois Syndrome; (12) Disuse Atrophy; (13) Lumbar Instability; (14) Acute Low Back Pain; and (15) Post-Surgical Low Back Pain.The DRX9000 should be used on patients who have low back pain, with or without radiculopathy who have failed conventional therapy (physiotherapy and chiropractic) and who are considering surgery. Surgery should only be considered following a reasonable trial of the DRX9000 protocols.Conditions That Are ContraindicatedPatients with the following problems or symptoms are usually excluded from using the DRX9000: pregnancy, prior lumbar fusion, metastatic cancer, severe osteoporosis, spondylolisthesis, compression fracture of lumbar spine below L-1, pars defect, aortic aneurysm, pelvic or abdominal cancer, disc space infections, severe peripheral neuropathy, hemiplegia, paraplegia, or cognitive dysfunction, cauda equina syndrome, tumors, osteod osteoma, multiple myeloma, osteo sarcoma, infection, osteomyelitis, meningitis, virus and disc pathology with a sequestered/free floating fragment.Time Frame for Patient ChangeOften times a patient experiences some relief within the first few (3-7) treatments. Usually by the 12th to 15th treatment all patients have reported significant remission of symptoms. Patients not showing significant improvement by the 15th to 18th session may be referred for further diagnostic evaluation.DRX9000 Is Not For EveryoneEighty-to-ninety percent of patients who have been properly selected and comply with the DRX9000 protocol will have good-to-excellent outcomes. Patient’s conditions that do not respond quickly to the DRX9000 are often unable to be helped by anything quickly. Patients vary in age, sex and body morphology and may require counseling in weight loss, nutrition and other lifestyle changes.Also, smoking, previous surgery and chronic use of narcotic or steroid medications, obesity, and large amounts of daily caffeine can have negative influences on the treatment.Standard DRX9000 Treatment ProtocolEach session on the DRX9000 is approximately 30 minutes long (45 minutes, including set-up and take-off), accompanied by 15 minutes of varied appropriate therapy depending on the physician’s assessment and recommendation. The patient comes for 20-25 visits over a 4-6 week period. A complete copy of the DRX9000 treatment protocol can be provided upon request.Treatment Frequency Can VaryTreatment frequency is based on diagnosis. For example, a patient with a herniated disc will, on average, be treated daily for two-to-four weeks, then 2-3 times a week for two weeks to be determined by periodic re-evaluations.For a degenerated disc, 3-5 times a week for five weeks and re-evaluation on the first and third week. Patients with facet arthropathy may report a sudden noticeable sensation as facets unlock followed by relief of symptoms. Treatments are then tapered off following this occurrence.Usually decompression occurs at the therapeutic force of approximately one-half the patient's weight plus or minus poundage as determined by the physician. This window of treatment is altered by factors such as small body frame (less weight) large frame (more weight), acute injury (less weight), etc.The DRX9000 Program Is ApprovedOutcomes of clinical studies on this type of equipment have shown consistent positive results. For example, with orthopedists affiliated with Georgetown University and George Washington University on a scientifically statistical number of patients (initially evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon for diagnosis confirmed by MRI) showed the subsiding of symptoms directly correlated with the progression of treatment. All patients had final evaluations at which time functional range of motion was restored and activities of daily living were resumed; most patients had complete relief of pain. The patients were instructed in biomechanics and modifications were made according to postural changes as outlined in the equipment protocol. All patients who were surgical candidates also had MRI documented findings.NOTE: One of the most important notations in the studies and reviews of the literature (also discussed in an earlier study by Shealy, LeRoy et al) was that conventional spinal traction was less effective and biomechanically insufficient for optimal therapeutic outcome (i.e. regular traction does not produce decompression, that is, unloading due to distraction and positioning of the intervertebral discs and facet joints of the lumbar spine).The DRX9000 Program is not regular spinal traction and does not utilize the conventional traction table. It is also not physical therapy although the protocol does contain elements of physical medicine and it is not to be confused with standard traction.Decompression Isn’t the Same as TractionNo. There is a big difference between traction, distraction and decompression. Traction has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The problem with traction, as it is known today, is that it is not always beneficial. In 1998, the Scientific American rated traction to be of little or no value in the examination of efficacious therapies for lower back pain. This finding is consistent with many studies that report traction can often times signal a nociceptive splinting response and put a patient’s back muscles in spasms, resisting any attempts to effect a change on the disc proper.Distraction, a term used to describe a flexion distraction technique, attempts to reposition the spine from the offending lesion. This technique has been shown to be very effective, even though potentially damaging to the person performing the technique and largely dependent on the skill of the technician. Like traction, distraction procedures are limited in the ability to reduce the intradiscal pressure, or produce a negative pressure within the disc imbibing fluid, nutrients and creating an environment for repair.Decompression therefore is an event - a combination of restraint, angle position and equipment engineering. At this writing there is no greater form of decompression available today than Axiom’s DRX9000. FINAL NOTE:The FDA does NOT consider this device investigational; clinical trials and outcomes studies have been published, in the literature, showing high percentage treatment results for the diagnoses listed. It is a superior version of some of the other types of decompression devices on the market and has produced similar or superior clinical outcomes due especially to the product's design and the treatment protocol. It is also non-invasive and is cost effective for the treatment of the diagnoses listed. The cost per patient can be in the range of $2500-$5000 as compared to the surgical procedures costing more than $30,000 (SurgiCenter facility fees plus procedure costs). Most of the time, the cost of this program is covered by the patient’s medical insurance. If not, there are usually financing programs available that can be interest free to the patient.FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: Health Solutions @ 217-347-3838

What is Spinal Traction?By Anne Asher, About.com GuideUpdated July 04, 2008About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by our Medical Review Board

Question: What is Spinal Traction?Answer: Traction is a modality (treatment activity) sometimes given by physical therapists, chiropractors and other spine specialists to their patients. The purpose of traction is to apply a force that draws two adjacent bones apart from each other in order to increase their shared joint space. Traction also stretches the soft tissue that surrounds the joint. Traction may be given manually, by means of a device or via positioning.
In the spine, the elongation provided by traction allows facet joints to slide, increases circulation and relieves pressure on the spinal cord, its blood vessels and nerve roots.
Traction is sometimes given to people with spinal stenosis, as it helps to make space around the compressed spinal cord. In any case, the improved circulation has an added, indirect benefit of decreasing chemicals in damaged tissues brought about by inflammation. The movement at the joints may also contribute to the decrease of nervous excitability, which is another source of pain.
Traction may be given continuously for up to 10 minutes at a time or intermittently for up to 15 minutes. When weights are used in providing the force, the practitioner will start light and, over time, move up to 15 pounds. This experience is meant to provide relaxation to the patient, rather than more tension.
Although many people can attest to the fact that traction on the spine feels good, a 2005 review of medical literature by the Cochrane Back Group found that, by itself, traction really isn't effective for lower back pain. After looking at 25 high-quality studies, which investigated a total of more than 1,000 traction patients, researchers concluded that if you are using traction as the only treatment, there's really no difference in results between it and placebo. For certain types of neck problems, though, the use of traction is alive and well in clinical settings, as a complement to other treatment measures.

Does Spinal Decompression Help Low Back Pain?By Brett Sears, About.com GuideUpdated January 26, 2012About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the Medical Review Board
See More About:low back paininversion tabletractionlow back exercises
Question: Does Spinal Decompression Help Low Back Pain?If you have low back pain, you probably understand how debilitating the condition may be. The symptoms that you feel coming from your low back can prevent you from sitting, walking, working, and enjoying recreational activities.
There are many different treatments and modalities available for your low back pain or sciatica. One such treatment that has become quite popular is spinal decompression. Online, television, and print advertising are bombarding consumers with promises of improved function and decreased pain. But are the claims true?
Answer: Spinal decompression is a form of mechanical spinal traction. Spinal traction refers to the separation of the bones, joints, and discs of the back. It is theorized that separating the bones, joints, and discs in the spine relieves pressure on the nerves in the back and helps decrease pain, and thus, improve function.
Advertising for spinal decompression targets people with degenerative disc disease, bulging discs, herniated discs, or spinal stenosis. Common trade names of spinal decompression devices are the VAX-D System, the SpinalAid System, and the DRX-9000 System, among others.
Many spinal decompression systems are operated by the use of a computer, allowing the health care provider to adjust the amount of traction force, the angle of traction provided, or the amount of time the traction force is applied. Some spinal decompression units require that you lie on your stomach while treatment is rendered; others have you lie on your back.
Are There Risks Associated with Spinal Decompression?
A review of the published data for the use of spinal decompression reveals very little risk associated with treatment. One study reported on a patient who developed severe pain while on the unit. A follow-up MRI of the spine revealed that this patient’s lumbar herniated disc had increased in size. The patient subsequently had a lumbar surgery and it was reported that the patient recovered fully. Other studies report some increase in pain for a few participants.
Many insurance companies (including Medicare and Medicaid in the US) do not provide medical coverage for spinal decompression. Most cite the paucity in well-conducted research as a reason. Spinal decompression therapy is often considered experimental in nature. Therefore, another “risk” associated with spinal decompression is the risk of losing money. Many protocols for the use of spinal decompression involve you attending sessions multiple times per week for several weeks. The out-of-pocket expense that you may incur as a result may be excessive.
Does Spinal Decompression Help Low Back Pain?
The main theory behind spinal decompression is that providing traction to the compressed structures in the spine helps relieve pressure and pain. So traction must help low back pain, right? A study published in the 2001 issue of Physical Therapy Journal (PTJ) evaluated various forms of treatment for acute (symptoms for less than 4 weeks), sub-acute (4-12 weeks) and chronic (more than 12 weeks) low back pain. The published evidence available for the use of traction for low back pain received a grade of “C” (no benefit demonstrated).
Claims have also been made that spinal decompression creates negative pressure in the discs of the spine, which helps to pull bulging discs back into place. A published study reporting on three patients concludes that spinal decompression did lower the pressure in the discs while using decompression. This is a small study, however, and no cause and effect conclusion about spinal decompression and low back pain can be made.
Available studies examining the use of spinal decompression systems in the treatment of low back pain are of poor quality. This makes evaluating the claims made by proponents of spinal decompression difficult.
A review of studies about spinal decompression by Dwain M. Daniel concludes:
""There is very limited evidence in the scientific literature to support the effectiveness of non-surgical spinal decompression therapy. This intervention has never been compared to exercise, spinal manipulation, standard medical care or other less expensive conservative treatment options which have an ample body of research demonstrating efficacy. Considering the cost-benefit relationship, many better researched and less expensive treatment options are available to the clinician.""
Simply put, there is limited scientific evidence that spinal decompression can help your low back pain. Does that mean that it does not work? Not entirely. It just means that the current level of research is not sufficient to draw positive cause/effect conclusions for the use of spinal decompression. There may be other more affordable options for you to consider when faced with treating your low back pain.
What Does Help Low Back Pain?
While many treatments are available for your low back pain, the scientific data indicates that maintaining normal activity is a good treatment (grade of “A” -- benefit demonstrated -- in the 2001 PTJ review) for acute low back pain. Exercises for your low back also received a grade of “A” for sub-acute and chronic low back pain.
The great thing about exercise is that it is a low-cost, easily implemented treatment. Your physical therapist can teach you how to improve your posture and implement the right exercise program for your specific condition to treat your low back pain.

[edit] Bulging Disc Treatment - Treatment options To aid Lower Protrusion
Bulging discs are common ailments into the herniated disc but slightly different. This gives them a large selection of treatment possibilities for 1 to choose from.

[edit] Medication
The most common medication for bulging disc may be the pain-killers, relaxants and ant-inflammatory drugs. These help relieve the problems together with bring about peace inside the muscle groups.
Cortisone injections which are created towards the spinal canal are quite helpful. They act quickly in relieving in the acute soreness and inflammation which leads to the irritation on the nerves. The down side of this treatment method is usually that you grow to be dependant towards the medications. Failure leads to recurrence in the pain.
This process requires no drugs and its success are incredibly productive. This technique stops the discomfort because of the healing from the disc difficulty. This is certainly carried out making use of laptop managed pumps which enables backbone re-hydration for the disc thereby repositioning the spine elements back again to their tracks. It delivers a organic therapeutic.
[edit] Surgery
This is simply not common unless the ailment gets quite severe. Considerations on the other hand have to be taken just before picking this method of cure because if done improperly, it could direct to lasting damages. It truly is even highly advised from by most medical physicians on the bulging disk sufferers.
In the event you will need to have this health-related procedure, which can be pretty effective if done correctly, you should go for the laser surgical treatment. That is specific, causes significantly less scares and probability of destroying the healthful cells are minimal. What's much more is that the method will take significantly less time to heal than other sorts of medical procedures.
[edit] The McKenzie strategy
This is an effective approach of therapy by which spine treatment is done utilizing the notion of posture, dysfunction and derangement. It basically offers with spine abnormalities for accidents a result of stress. This cure essentially would make the use of extension exercise routines where the decreased again if hyper-extended to allow decompression and give them relocation to your preferred site.
[edit] The Williams Process
This technique applies the reverse in the McKenzie method in bulging disc treatment. Therapy is made in regards towards the ability from the backbone getting unstable due to dysfunction type lack of adequate support. Flexion (bending) placement will be the main process applied to inspire disc decompression within the nerves.
[edit] Problems
This features the injection of cortisone in spinal canal, but exterior the spinal sac. This has considerable rewards in suffering reduction and inflammation which irritates the nerves. It is nonetheless accomplished by a ache management professional, normally an anesthesiologist. It is an outpatient affair and requires less than an hour to finish.
Irrespective of the presented technique of treatments, the clients have to be physically and mentally ready to just take the treatment method.

chronic back pain
What can I do about my chronic back pain? One way to alleviate back pain is to arch the body, as people and animals do when they stretch to relax. Lying backwards so that the front of the body is stretched will further relax the spine, with the additional benefit of freeing discs and vertebrae from the normal downward pull of gravity. As the body stretches backwards, abdominal muscles tighten and strengthen, and therefore help to take more of the load off the lower back.
BodyBridge
Arching the back reduces stress. Some studies have even suggested that this effect can reduce stress on the lower back by 50%. In the process it provides mild, passive exercise of the ligaments, tendons and musculature that surround the abdominal cavity. As a result it permits a better supply of blood to flow to all parts of the body, by utilizing the pull of gravity in different directions from those we experience in a normal upright position.
The BodyBridge is a curved topped passive traction table which decompresses the spine. Each disk can gently separate through passive traction. Once decompression takes place, pressure is taken off the muscle groups in the low, mid and upper back. Many of our customers are now pain free because they took the time to retrain their muscles by using the BodyBridge daily. Learn to bend backwards with the BodyBridge and start to regain the flexibility and strength necessary to live a healthy and productive life.

Posted on October 6, 2011 by
Living a life filled with chronic pain can often make the most basic daily tasks seem difficult. Struggling to get out of bed in morning because of pain might mean that a person will never be able to achieve the success they deserve. For those whose daily routine involves an endless cycle of painkillers, doctors visits, and talk of invasive surgery, there might be another option available: spinal decompression. If everything else has failed to cure yourchronic pain, then spinal decompression might mean relief from the nagging effects of back pain, herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, bulging disc, sciatica, leg pain, tingling, numbness, spinal stenosis, or failed low back syndrome.
Spinal decompression is a non-surgical treatment for painful symptoms of many serious conditions. Herniated disc is a term used to refer to any disc of the spine that comes out of place and invades the space where delicate nerves live. The pressing on the nerve can lead to other conditions like sciatica (causing leg pain).It can make it difficult to move at all, meaning otherwise healthy patients can be completely incapacitated. For others, the pain is less intense, but they still have to live with shooting sensations down their legs, lower back pain, or trouble moving the neck.
The 'traditional' answer to this terrible reality is surgery. Itcan also mean months of rehabilitation that renders the patient immobile during recovery.However, many studies conducted in the last few years have proven surgery to be no more effective then other procedures ; in extreme cases, it has the possibility to make the problem even worse. The new thinking about treatment centers on spinal decompression, which is a service offered by chiropractors who practice thisback surgery alternative . Instead of cutting into the flesh, chiropractors use machines like the DRX 9000 to provide patients with back pain relief from symptoms associated with these painful conditions.
The DRX 9000 is an FDA clearedspinal decompression procedure that usestraction to slowly and gently pulls the spine in an attempt to decompressthe interverterbal disc spaces. The process of spinal decompression literally distracts the spinal bones apart to remove pressure on discs, nerves and bones. This procedure is done slowly and precisely to reduce any chance of additional injury. Unlike surgery, this method does not require any kind of anesthesia or drugs and is done while the patient is lying down on the machinery. The precision of this computer-controlled machine is extraordinary and the programming technician can determine the specific area to be treated. Some studies have shown the overwhelmingly positive results of people report feeling pain relief after treatment-, which means that this does work for a large majority of those who try it.
A single session lasts about 45 minutes, and can often be complimented with a normal adjustment- yet sometimes chiropractic care is not indicated and the spinal decompression is administered as the sole treatment. While each case is different, the patient will usually visit the treatment center every day or three times a week fortwo weeks. After the initial daily treatments, the patient will continue to receive treatment three times a week for two to three weeks on average. This means that someone who has lived with years of pain can start to feel relief after only a month. This is an amazing new breakthrough that is another option for anyone who doesn't want to spend the rest of their life in pain or the next year recovering from surgery.
Spinal decompression with the DRX 9000 is ideal for patients suffering with herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, bulging disc,sciatica, leg pain, or chronic back pain. There's no reason to live with this pain any more, because chiropractors are now offering this revolutionary cure for damaged discs and back pain.

Bed Rest for Back Pain
Bed rest for back pain is an old fashioned treatment which is still prescribed for some symptomatic
dorsopathy
conditions today. Bed rest is difficult for any active patient, since it deprives them of their abilities to work and fulfill personal responsibilities. Bed rest is not appropriate for every
back ache
condition and might actually be counterproductive for many problematic pain syndromes. Most physical therapists will recommend that patients with chronic pain do not allow themselves to languish in bed, but instead to try to move and get their body functional ASAP to avoid muscular atrophy, circulation concerns and other possible negative effects of extended inactivity.Advertisement:
Bed Rest for Back Pain Indications
Bed rest is a good therapeutic treatment for many forms of
back injury.
Acutely painful muscular or structural traumas require time to heal without being stressed. For recently injured
back muscles,
ligaments or
discs,
relaxing for a couple of days might be a very good idea. During this time, it is usually recommended to try and change positions in bed to prevent stiffness, as well as to increase circulation to the affected area.
Ice or wet heat
might be a good addition to your relaxation time. Regardless of the cause of pain, most patients are advised to try not to prolong their time in bed to more than a few days. Of course, it is wise to seek professional advice from your doctor if you have recently injured your back.
Bed Rest for Back Pain Contraindications
Bed rest is rarely a good idea for
chronic
or recurrent
acute back pain
conditions. Time spent in bed slows down circulatory response to the affected area, often prolonging the pain past its normal expectancy. Bed rest and traction treatments have proven themselves to be virtually useless for most ongoing spinal pain conditions. Bed rest will not be of any assistance for
psychosomatic back pain
and will typically only delay an intensification of symptoms once the patient does decide to start moving around again. Often times, patients suffering from psychosomatic symptoms will eventually develop pain while reclining as well, making life a torturous nightmare with no end to their horrific suffering.
Bed Rest for Back Pain Advice
While bed rest is an adequate short term answer to sudden acute back pain, it is not an effective long-term solution. Most painful conditions will linger in a patient confined to bed and the
fear
of movement will grow stronger day by day. This fear can cause
psychological symptom escalation,
even in patients with verifiable physical back pain. It is typically advised to try to move around and get the circulation going inside the body to speed healing. Blood which is slow moving or stagnant near the injury will increase inflammation and prevent the removal of cellular waste products which can cause, worsen and extend the duration pain. Even mild activity, such as standing and walking, is usually far better than lying about day after day. Make sure to talk to your
doctor
about using bed rest as a
treatment
for your particular type of back ache. Never assume you will be confined to bed for an extended time, since this may only make your symptoms last longer. Be careful, but test your physical abilities regularly and try to integrate some gentle activity into your rest time. A good general rule states that the longer you stay in bed, the longer your pain may last and the better the chances might be for a symptomatic recurrence in the near future.Advertisement:

Brooklyn Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression
Non-surgical spinal decompression is the new age treatment to address excruciating pain emanating from the back and spreading to other parts of the body. Pain management physicians at HealthQuest offer this effective therapy in Brooklyn, New York to provide fast pain relief and comfort to their patients.
Spinal decompression therapy involves the application of a distraction force that relieves nerve compression by creating a negative pressure. This pulls back the expanded disc to its place while facilitating the healing of the damaged discs by stimulating blood supply and taking in oxygen along with other essential nutrients.
FDA Approved Alternative to Back Surgery
At HealthQuest physicians use the FDA approved VAX-D spinal decompression modality for the therapy. The treatment is quite effective for acute and chronic back conditions where the spine and the nerves endure excessive stress. It has benefits such as:
No risk associated with the procedure
Patients who undergo the treatment don�t require medication
Conditions Treated with Non-surgical Spinal Decompression
Spinal decompression is proven effective for those who continue to experience pain following a failed back surgery. Some of the various other spinal conditions that can be effectively treated with the therapy are:
Herniated and bulging lumbar discs
Lumbar disc
Facet syndromes
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Pinched nerves
Sciatica
Spinal Stenosis
Foraminal stenosis
Radiculopathy
Depending on the seriousness of the patient�s condition, the number of sessions required might vary. Each session takes about thirty to forty minutes at the most, after which the patient can return home.

Spinal Decompression Therapy for Neck and Back Pain
This entry is filed under Uncategorized.
Spinal decompression is a drug-free treatment available for treating a wide array of back disorders. If you are tired of surgical processes, this technique can provide you with complete relief. The treatment requires no complicated or risky surgical process and is totally safe. The method was developed from years of research and is ideal for long term relief from pain.
Until recently, patients with back pain were usually given drugs with possible side-effects, referred to physical therapists, or sent for surgery. The structure of our back is comprised of spinal bones (vertebrae), their joints, discs between vertebras, and the muscles and ligaments which bind all the parts together. The discs which act as a cushion between the vertebrae can get damaged and the gelatinous material inside can leak, leading to herniated disc which is the cause of pain. These types of back pains can be treated with modern decompression techniques including Decompression Therapy System (DTS), VAX-D, ABS systems, DRX-3000, DRX9000, and the Accu-Spina System.
Spinal compression is the common cause for neck and back pain. Spinal decompression causes the expansion of disc herniations, which are the cause for the pressure exerted on nearby spinal nerve roots. Decompression technique works by taking away pressure from damaged discs so that the bulging will shrink back to its original size and thus protect the surrounding discs from getting damaged. The treatment has also proved to be successful in treating spinal stenosis, sciatica, pinched nerve, facet syndrome, low back disc bulge, golf related pain, and degenerative disc disease.
The spinal decompression treatment normally takes about 6-8 weeks. It can be followed by neuromuscular, cardiovascular and diet therapy for even greater results. All treatment methods are affordable and are designed to alleviate all types of back pain. The treatment procedure is effective and results can be seen within the initial weeks of the treatment.

Treatment for Spinal Disc Herniation
This entry is filed under Disc Pain Treatment.
Treatment for spinal disc herniation does not involve surgery all the time. Chiropractic care and physical therapy along with anti-inflammatory medication can offer effective pain treatment. Disc pain treatment also depends on the precise condition of the individual. Spinal disc herniation is one of the causes of sciatica pain and disc pain. Spinal disc herniation may be referred to as lumbar herniated disc, bulging disc, slipped disc or pinched nerve.
Spinal Disc Herniation
Spinal disc herniation is a case where the inner core — called nucleus pulposus – of a disc bulges or herniates out from its location into the spinal canal. This process is called herniation. The leaked liquid core compresses or irritates a nerve root in the spinal column causing pain and discomfort. Sciatica pain commonly occurs due to this condition. Even if there is no direct nerve root compression from the liquid, the leaked out fluidic core could cause inflammation of the surrounding tissue. This causes pain too, and the inflamed tissue could further compress the nerve root.
What Causes Disc Herniation?
Disc herniation can occur when the individual bends to a side or at an awkward angle. Wear and tear resulting from sedentary jobs or sudden injury caused by lifting objects while bending sideways at the waist could cause herniation. Sometimes, long term wear and tear contributes to sudden herniation while falling or bending. Wear and tear can be indicated by pain or chronic fatigue at the back. Bending awkwardly or a sedentary lifestyle causes the internal pressure to be irregularly applied on the discs, thus increasing chances of the liquid core bulging out from one of the discs.
Non-surgical Methods for Disc Pain Treatment
Disc pain treatment primarily consists of anti-inflammatory medication or NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) along with chiropractic care, massages, physical therapy and anti-depressants. This is the basis of pain management as most cases of disc herniation heal without surgery within six weeks. Epidural steroid injections may also be prescribed.
Chiropractic Care
Chiropractic manipulation offered by specialized healthcare centers is quite a valuable tool for healing many musculoskeletal disorders including spinal disc herniation and sciatica treatment. Chiropractic care reduces inflammation and strengthens the body’s own resistance, making this a natural, safe and truly effective procedure. Both chiropractic disc pain treatment and spinal decompression require expert handling, which the healthcare professionals at multidisciplinary healthcare centers offer.
Benefits of Spinal Decompression for Disc Pain Management
Spinal decompression is an advanced and effective pain treatment method specifically developed for spinal disc herniation. This FDA-approved treatment uses a spinal decompression machine that creates a negative pressure between the spinal discs. The vacuum increases the height between the discs and attempts to treat the bulged out liquid into the disc. This ensures faster healing and improved blood supply.

Chiropractic Treatment
Modern chiropractic treatment includes spinal manipulation, manual therapy, and spinal distraction, and has been practiced for over one hundred years. The use of spinal manipulation for low back pain has been documented as beneficial in many of the published guidelines for the treatment of lower back pain.
Chiropractors often use the word ""subluxation"" to describe the altered position of the vertebra and subsequent functional loss. This differs from the medical use of the word subluxation, defined as an abnormal separation of the articular surfaces of a joint which can be quantified on radiographic imaging studies such as x-rays and CT scans.
Another term often used by Chiropractors is ""adjustment"", which refers to the specific manipulation chiropractors apply to vertebrae that have abnormal movement patterns or fail to function normally. A chiropractic adjustment involves using the hands or a device to apply a controlled, sudden force to a joint, moving it beyond its passive range of motion. This is often associated with an audible ""pop"" or ""crack"". This sound is due to a release of gas within the joints, which relieves joint pressure. The goal of the chiropractic adjustment is to increase the range and quality of motion in the area being treated.
Chiropractors and physical therapists utilize other forms of manual or manipulative therapy for spinal disorders such as stretching, traction, and massage. Spinal manipulation should be combined with active stretching and strengthening exercises for maximum benefit. Chiropractors and therapists may combine the use of spinal manipulation with several other treatments and approaches such as heat, ice, electrical stimulation, and exercise.
Chiropractors do not utilize drugs or surgery in their practice. However, there are times when a chiropractor will recommend that the patient consult a medical doctor if these or other methods of treatment are indicated.
Side effects and risks of spinal manipulation depend on the specific type of chiropractic treatment used. These can include temporary headaches, fatigue, or discomfort in parts of the body that were treated. The likelihood of serious complications appears to be low and related to the type of adjustment performed and the part of the body treated.
Chiropractic care and spinal manipulation techniques used by physical therapists have been shown to be safe and effective in the management of low back pain when combined with stabilization and strengthening exercises. Pain that persists beyond six weeks or that is associated with radiating leg or arm symptoms should be evaluated by a medical physician.

Traction
Introduction

Selected links
Useful Article?
Introduction
If you have a broken bone or a condition affecting your muscles, neck or spine, you may find that traction is used as part of your treatment.
Traction involves the medical team applying a pulling force to the limbs, soft tissues, pelvis or spine. It can either be used to stretch a single part of the body or to separate two individual parts of the body.
More specifically, traction can be used to:
realign and fix any bone fractures into a permanent position (a fracture is a clean break in the bone that does not break through the skin)
treat muscle spasms (sudden, uncontrollable muscle contractions)
rest inflamed or infected joints
stretch the soft tissues that surround a joint and reduce pain before surgery is carried out
correct a muscle contracture (shortening of a muscle)
treat deformities that are caused by conditions such as scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine)
reduce joint dislocations
Types of traction
There are two main types of traction that use different methods to apply the pulling force to the body or limbs. They are:
skin traction
skeletal traction
These are described in more detail below.
Skin traction
Skin traction uses various pieces of equipment, such as splints, adhesive bandages and braces, to apply pressure to the affected area of the body to help support it.
A pulling force is applied to the affected area of the body through the soft tissues. The soft tissues support and connect other tissues in the body. They include:
skin
muscles
tendons
blood vessels
fat
Skeletal traction
Skeletal traction is used when a greater force needs to be placed on the traction apparatus.
The force is applied directly to the skeleton, which means that additional weight can be placed on the apparatus without damaging the surrounding soft tissues.
Equipment that is used during skeletal traction includes:
pins
wires
screws
tongs (gripping tools)
These are surgically implanted into the affected bone.
See Traction – How it is performed for more information about skin traction and skeletal traction.
Manual traction
As well as skin traction and skeletal traction, manual traction is available too, although it is rarely used these days. It is usually carried out by a physiotherapist (a healthcare professional who uses massage and manipulation to promote healing).
During manual traction, the physiotherapist applies a pulling force manually to affected body part, either using their hands or a weights machine.
^^ Back to top
How is it performed?
Skin traction
Skin traction is often used to treat fractures of the limbs and hips. The pulling force helps to keep the fractured bones in the correct position before surgery is carried out.
Skin traction usually takes place while a person is lying in a hospital bed. It uses apparatus such as:
adhesive tape
bandages
gloves and boots that are attached to weights
The weights and affected body parts are pulled up using a pulley system that is attached to the bed.
Skeletal traction
Skeletal traction is used to treat fractures that require more pulling force than skin traction can supply or when splinting (the use of a rigid support) has not been effective. The skin can usually only support up to 3.5kg (8lb), whereas the skeleton can support up to 12kg (25lb).
During skeletal traction, pins or screws will be surgically implanted directly into the bone. This can be done using either a local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic.
Local anaesthetic is where the affected area is numbed so that no pain or discomfort is felt during the procedure. If you have a general anaesthetic you will be completely unconscious.
After the pins or screws have been implanted, weights will be attached to them to pull the affected body part into the correct position. The amount of time that skeletal traction is required will depend on how severely injured the bones are.
Does traction work?
Despite being widely used for hundreds of years, there is little in the way of clinical evidence to support the use of traction. For example, there is little evidence to prove that manual traction is an effective treatment for spinal conditions such as:
neck pain
back pain
sciatica – pain that is caused by irritation to, or compression of, the sciatic nerve
Several studies have been carried out that either produced inconclusive results or concluded that there were more effective treatments than manual traction, such as physiotherapy and exercise.
Skin and skeletal traction do seem to be effective in treating some types of fracture, although some healthcare professionals believe that traction is unnecessary in treating minor fractures.

Commonly Asked Questions
Back Pain
What does back pain feel like?
Back pain can range from a sharp or dull pain to tingling, numbness or a burning sensation. It may be tender to the touch or result in limited range-of-motion.
How common is back pain?
Unfortunately, 90% of Americans will have back pain at some point in their lives. This year, millions of Americans will experience a potentially debilitating back injury. For some, they’ll suffer pain or discomfort for the rest of their lives, due to an incorrect diagnosis, improper or inadequate care. According to a 1998 study in the British Medical Journal, 75% of back pain sufferers who do nothing about their back pain will either have pain or disability 12 months later.
What are common causes of back pain?
At the AIMS Clinic, we believe identifying the cause makes all the difference when seeking back pain relief! Back pain is caused by many factors such as: Poor Posture (improper position when sitting, reading, sleeping or working at a computer), Injury (auto, sports or slip and fall), Improper Bending and Lifting Techniques, Inadequate Muscle Strength, Shortened Muscles, Strained Muscles or Ligaments, Scoliosis, Arthritis, Being Overweight, Facet Joint Syndrome, Pinched Nerve, Sciatica, Spinal Stenosis, Bulging or Herniated Disc or Segmental Instability (excess movement between two vertebrae, causing pinching or irritation of the nerve roots).
How do you find the cause of back pain?
Finding this cause, begins with a thorough health history, understanding of the patient’s symptoms, along with a structural and muscular examination. Our Physical Therapy and Chiropractic Teams may perform a manual exam, palpate the spine and conduct specialized testing to analyze posture, range-of-motion, muscle strength and nerve function. Other diagnostic tests may include laboratory blood studies to determine if there is an underlying disorder, x-rays, CAT scan, MRI, electromyography and nerve conduction studies.
How do I stop my back pain?
After our Team detects the cause or causes of back pain, the proper treatment can be instituted to achieve back pain relief. Treatment may include medications, as well as injections of ligaments, muscles, bursae, joints and specialized injections such as epidural injections or facet joint block injections. Physical Therapy, Chiropractic or Acupuncture may be an integral part of the back pain treatment program.
Can spinal decompression help?
Spinal decompression - traction that may help relieve back pain, may be considered. Spinal decompression works by gently stretching the spine - taking pressure off spinal discs (gel-like cushions between the bones in your spine). Additionally, spinal decompression is successful in treating neck pain, bulging or herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, posterior facet syndrome (worn spinal joints) and radiculopathy (injured or diseased spinal nerve roots). This revolutionary treatment method, which may be covered by health insurance - has resulted in canceling surgeries and allowing people to live life to the fullest. Many patients experience substantial, immediate relief of their symptoms after their first treatment.
Will physical therapy help back pain?
There are several forms of physical therapy utilized for back pain relief. For acute pain, the physical therapist may focus on decreasing pain with passive physical therapy (modalities). They are considered passive therapies because they are done to the patient, rather than the patient rehabilitating with exercise. Examples of modalities include: Ice (makes blood vessels constrict which decreases the blood flow - helping to control inflammation, muscle spasm and pain), Heat (makes blood vessels dilate, which increases the blood flow - helping flush away chemicals that cause pain, as well as bringing in healing nutrients and oxygen.), Ultrasound (uses high-frequency sound waves to reach sore muscles and other tissues that are over two inches below the surface of your skin, which help flush the sore area and bring in a new supply of blood that is rich in nutrients and oxygen.) Electrical Stimulation (can ease pain by sending impulses to the brain that are felt instead of pain.), Soft Tissue Massage (reduces pain and spasm by helping muscles relax - by bringing in a fresh supply of oxygen and nutrient-rich blood and by flushing the area of chemical irritants that come from inflammation.), Joint Mobilization (changing pressure and movements to the joints to help lubricate joint surfaces to ease stiffness and reduce pain.) and Traction (sore joints and muscles often feel better when traction (pull) is used.).
In addition to passive therapies, active physical therapy (exercise) is also necessary to rehabilitate the spine. Generally, a patient’s back exercise program will encompass a combination of stretching exercises, strengthening exercises and low impact aerobics. Strength and flexibility must be built up gradually - on a gradient level. Doing too much too soon often causes muscle strain. Our physical therapists use functional training to help patients with daily activities. This will include a healthy posture program to keep the spine in safe alignment, reducing strain on the joints and soft tissues around the spine.
Can vitamins or water play a role in alleviating back pain?
Other back pain relief recommendations include staying hydrated. Drink plenty of water to help flush away acidic waste products from the muscles. High levels of acidic waste products in the muscles can cause muscle irritation and pain. Poor dietary choices can lead to chronic inflammation - increasing pain sensitivity. Daily supplementation of Vitamin D can help alleviate a deficiency and low back pain, according to recent studies.
If my back pain is not going away, what should I do?
Many back pain patients treated at the AIMS Clinic have previously treated with various doctors, specialists and therapists, tried bed rest, a multitude of strong drugs and over-the-counter medication and sadly, many have had failed surgery. They come to us because they're still in pain ...and they’ve heard about the success of our program offered here in East Brunswick, NJ. Many are close to losing hope because even after all the consultations, tests and treatments they've been through, they still don't... move like they used to!

Non Surgical Spinal Decompression
This entry is filed under Spinal decompression, Spinal decompression therapy.
Severe back and neck pain is a debilitating condition faced by people worldwide, and these problems if left untreated, can cause permanent loss of functioning in regions associated with the neck and the back. Although traditional techniques exist, new treatment methods have been developed which are faster and more effective. One such new treatment procedure for treating back pain is the non-surgical spinal decompression technique.
Spinal decompression is a safe, drug-free and painless treatment for treating back pain. The treatment works on the principle that a linear force applied to the body can create a negative pressure between the vertebrae. This pressure can push back a misaligned disc into its proper place, thus maintaining the alignment which increases the normal circulation of oxygen, water and nutritional liquids into the area. Earlier treatment procedures required the patient to take harmful drugs and sometimes even undergo surgeries.
One associated technology is the Decompression Therapy System (DTS) and all decompression techniques require the patient to lie on his/her back on the decompression table with padded straps around the chest and waist. The treatment is comfortable for patients and all equipments used are FDA certified. Spinal decompression techniques have been found successful in treating physical ailments such as bulging or herniated discs, facet syndrome, sciatica, spinal arthritis, spinal stenosis, degenerative joint disease, chronic back pain and post-surgical low back pain.
Decompression technique is an effective solution for common difficulties associated with the back pain arising from damages to the vertebrae, which often cause the gelatinous material inside to flow out. The technique also reduces the strain on muscles, wrenching of ligaments and reduces the pain of arms and legs.
With more and more patients receiving decompression treatment, the credibility of this technique is increasing rapidly. The treatment is producing better results, while the cost is effective compared to other available treatments.

Spinal Decompression Therapy in New York City
This entry is filed under Spinal decompression, Spinal decompression therapy.
Spinal decompression is a traction therapy which treats pain in the lower back, buttocks and hip. It is FDA approved for patient safety and efficiency in treating a wide range of spinal ailments. Some of the premier healthcare facilities and clinics in New York City offer this procedure.
An Alternative Non-surgical Therapy
Patients who suffer from a herniated disc and those who experience recurring back pain would find the non-surgical therapy an effective remedy. In some cases, it can be an alternative treatment option to surgery. The therapy can easily reverse nerve impairment, reduce the stress on the spine and mend damaged discs. Spinal decompression therapy can also be used for the treatment of the following spinal conditions:
Sciatica
Degenerative discs
Pinched nerves
Spinal stenosis
Facet syndrome
Numbness
Radiculopathy
The procedure uses state-of-the-art technology to release excessive pressure on the spine by applying a gentle, negative pressure. This results in the creation of a vacuum which pulls back the herniated or protruded disc back in its place. Apart from stimulating blood supply, essential nutrients which help in the healing process are also drawn in.
A single session takes up to 45 minutes under normal treatment conditions and is provided on an outpatient basis. Patients experience relief after undergoing the first of a series of treatment sessions.
Not everyone can undergo spinal decompression. Specialists who undertake the procedure would determine if the patient is eligible to undergo the traction therapy. The number of sessions required would depend upon the seriousness or complexity of the ailment. However, those who have vertebral fractures, spondylolisthesis and osteoporosis do not qualify for spinal decompression treatment.
Spinal Decompression Offers Long-lasting Relief from Pain
Spinal decompression therapy in New York City is offered in a safe and comfortable environment where the patients can feel at ease. The treatment is least painful or discomforting. Men and women of almost all age groups can undergo the procedure. It provides long lasting relief from debilitating pain and helps patients get back on their feet and lead a normal life.

Spinal Rehab Solutions introduces the SR 500 Ambulatory Lumbar Spinal-Air Traction Belt. The unique and innovative design of our device will provide continuous therapeutic relief on the go that will allow you the freedom to return to a carefree active lifestyle Unlike other traditional support belts that limit mobility to the spine, the thin and light weight design of the SR 500 is patented expandable air-traction system is designed to mold to the natural curvature of the lumbar spine to offer a high degree of mobility as well as support while assisting with active-rehabilitation.
The SR 500 can be worn either over clothing or discreetly under clothing. The function of the SR 500 is scientific, precise and most of all very simple. Spinal traction is created, and vertebral disc spaces are increased as the device is being inflated. The vertical air expansion cell mechanism applies negative pressure on the intervertebral disc space decreasing the pressure in the lumbar spine region by pushing upward on the lower part of the rib cage while pushing downward on the upper part of the hips, thereby diverting the weight bearing forces away and reducing the pressure within the lumbar spine region, significantly reducing pain levels.
Another unique feature that makes the SR 500 the most versatile brace of its kind is the detachable anterior and posterior rigid panels that are specifically designed for the patient who requires extra spinal stabilization, especially for those who are pre and post surgery. In addition, it is the perfect solution for those patients that cannot tolerate a rigid body jacket yet require the support of one. As the patient progresses in their active-rehabilitation the need for another device is eliminated as the SR 500 transitions along with their progress by simply removing the detachable rigid panels either one at a time or all together to easily convert to a soft LSO (Lumbar Sacral Orthosis) for greater flexibility.
Spinal Traction reveals promising results for the future, and effective management of patients with all types of disc disease and spinal injuries. With over 2 million patients and physicians currently using our technology, Spinal Rehab Solutions is honored to have the opportunity to assist those who are in need of ""Improving Quality Of Life�.

Back Pain Therapy
Watch your back - not everyone is your friend. But the therapist who tries traction on your back and relieves your back pain will be your best friend.
Although they call it the rack, traction is actually reasonably comfortable. Especially if you do it to somebody else. (Only joking!)
There are no scientific guarantees that traction is effective for low back pain or for relieving pressure on the nerve roots of your spine. We don't know exactly how much traction force therapists should apply or for how long to treat the various back problems for which it's used. But traction is commonly used by therapists to relieve symptoms of neck and back pain, so someone thinks it must work.
ON THE RACK
Traction is set up on your lumbar spine by passing a strap across your chest and placing a second strap around your pelvis. The strap around your chest is fixed. A weight is then applied to the strap around your pelvis to pull your spine to its full length. This relieves the pressure on the intervertebral discs of your lumbar spine.
HOW AND WHERE?
People in orthopaedic wards in hospital are sometimes treated with traction, when weights are attached to the pelvis or legs for long periods. But traction can be applied for short periods, say 15-20 minutes, to people who are not bedridden. This might be done during visits to a treatment clinic such as a physiotherapy department. Then the period of treatment will be stretched out, probably being repeated up to three times per week for several weeks.
Nowadays, most traction is done in the physiotherapy outpatient clinic. In the past, when people were stuck in hospital having long periods of traction, their muscles wasted. Then, when they did finally get off the traction and out of bed, their muscles were so weak they couldn't keep their spine stable, and they lost the benefits from the treatment.
Outpatient traction is usually applied electronically. You lie on the treatment couch. The traction machine (note: machine, not engine!) is attached to the strap around your pelvis by a rope. The machine is then adjusted to the correct weight for you, depending on your problem and body size. Some therapists apply a constant weight for the whole 20 minutes or so of the treatment session, others use intermittent traction. In this case, the traction will pull at its maximum for about 30 seconds, followed by a comparative rest period of half-pull power for around 10 seconds. This on-almost-off pattern is continued for the length of the session.
A good traction couch splits in the middle. As the weight is applied, the lower section of the bed moves on rollers to accommodate the tension that is applied to your back. This means that not so much weight is needed to actually pull on your spine, as the friction of the manoeuvre is reduced.
It's difficult to get the straps round very fat people (obviously nobody's ever heard of longer straps), so if this describes you, tough!
THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION
You can apply gentle traction to yourself at home, taking care not to harm your back. Hanging by both of your arms from a door or other strong, tall structure could give temporary relief from your back pain. Place a cloth over the door, near to the hinges. (Pulling the door off and wrestling with it on your knees ain't gonna do you much good.) Grip the top of the door over the cloth with your hands and slowly lift your body off the ground. Alternatively, place two upright chairs near enough together that you can sit on the floor between them with an elbow and forearm on each seat. Gently lift your bottom off the ground and let your body hang.
CAN TRACTION DO HARM?
Traction can give you increased pain if the outer layer of the nerve is stuck to the tissue around it through inflammation. Then, when the weights pull on the spine, you will yelp. Sometimes the benefits you gain during the traction are lost by the time you have struggled off the bed. But then, you're not in any condition to complain, are you?
WHEN DOES TRACTION HELP?
If you have an arthritic spine, traction might help. The stretching movements of the traction may well help if you've been immobile.
With an intervertebral disc problem, where the centre of the disc is bulging but has not actually slipped out between the two vertebrae, relieving the pressure on it by using traction can help it settle back into place.

Relieve Neck and Back Pain With Spinal Decompression Therapy
Thursday, March 1st, 2012 at
9:45 am
By Roosevelt Smith
Spinal decompression therapy is an FDA approved, non-surgical treatment for chronic neck and low back pain. It has saved thousands of people from having to undergo surgery or taking strong pain medications. With up to an 86% success rate, many patients have experienced dramatic pain relief and healing with this therapy.
Many medical doctors simply do not know how to treat chronic neck and back pain. They may write you a prescription for a strong painkiller but this only masks the symptoms and does not fix the problem. These strong medications can be addictive and may cause problems in the future. Other doctors may try to steer you toward surgery in an effort to relive back pain. While surgery may be effective in some cases, it is not always necessary. Considering the difficult recovery, time off of work and potential complications, surgery should only be a last resort.
People suffering from chronic neck and back pain who are looking for non-surgical treatment options often turn to a chiropractor for assistance. Chiropractors are experts at relieving neck and back pain without the use of surgery or drugs. They use gentle techniques that reduce pain and promote healing. They also make recommendations for lifestyle changes and exercises that will help strengthen the muscles and expand range of motion.
Some common lower back complaints include: herniated or bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, posterior facet syndrome, sciatica and acute or chronic back pain. Patients suffering from these conditions have found relief with spinal decompression therapy. The treatment is not only safe and painless, but also comfortable and relaxing. The course of therapy includes approximately 20 treatment sessions and is completed in about 35 days. Each procedure is performed with a unique, patent pending physio-therapeutic device and is administered by a certified clinician, specializing in back pain care. The treatment sessions are brief, lasting approximately 30 minutes.
Each treatment consists of a physician prescribed treatment on the Spinal Decompression and is designed to provide static, intermittent, and cycling distraction forces to relieve pressures on structures that may be causing back pain. During this procedure, by cycling through distraction and relaxation phases and by proper positioning, a spinal disc can be isolated and placed under negative pressure, causing a vacuum effect within it. This vacuum effect accomplishes two things. From a mechanical standpoint, disc material that has protruded or herniated outside the normal confines of the disc can be pulled back within the disc by the vacuum created within the disc. Also, the vacuum within the disc stimulates growth of blood supply, secondarily stimulating a healing response. This results in pain reduction and proper healing at the injured site.
Spinal decompression therapy relieves pain associated with herniated discs, protruding discs, degenerative disc disease, posterior facet syndrome, sciatica, and general neck and low back pain. Studies have concluded that at some time 80% of all Americans suffer from back pain, making spinal decompression therapy a much-needed component in the treatment of those conditions.
Spinal decompression traction therapy is an accepted medical procedure. It is covered by most health insurance. Keep in mind that your medical insurance may have constraints with regarding co-payments and prior authorization for therapy. These constraints would apply to spinal decompression as well. Ask your chiropractor’s office staff to assist you in filing with your insurance company.

Medical Studies on Inversion Therapy Every medical study ever done that we know of that has focused on the therapeutic value of inversion therapy on people with disc problems - including ruptured discs, herniated discs, degenerative disc disease etc. have shown that inversion therapy has a positive effect and can reduce the need for drugs and surgery. Since 1980 our company has worked with orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, chiropractors, sports medicine doctors and other health professionals and our experience confirms what the studies show. If done properly (please read - Suggestions For Getting Started) inversion therapy can have a very beneficial value in reversing disc compression and nerve impingement. Inversion Therapy Studies Studies Summary Martin - Dr. Robert Martin Newcastle University Study Inversion - Back Pain Relief Nosse - Inverted Spinal Traction Nachemson - Lumbar Disc Pressure Foreman - Traction and Spinal Load Giankopoulos - Lumbar Distreaction Meschino - Inversion in Chiropractic Murphy - Spondylolytic Anterolithesis Goldman - Inversion and Blood Pressure Sheffield - Inversion for Lumbar Traction Pickering - Gravity & the Nervous System Bouvier - Inversion and Chronic Bronchitis Bouvier - Inversion and Urinary Incontinence Newcastle University Study - Use an Inversion Table, Help Avoid Back Surgery People ask ""If inversion therapy is so beneficial, how come there are not more studies that prove it?"" www.energycenter.com has been in the inversion field since 1980 and we think there are very logical answers to this question. If you look at the Newcastle University Study you will see it was done at the Newcastle General Hospital in the UK using a Teeter Hang Ups Power II Inversion Table. The UK has socialized medicine. This is important because if the government can save money they will be willing to do research on techniques that may be able to avoid expensive procedures. In the U.S. medicine is a profit oriented industry that may not always look for solutions to problems if those solutions reduce the need for expensive and maybe even dangerous procedures. If you look into who funds much of the medical research in the U.S. you will find it is drug companies and other industries associated with the medical establishment. Even government research is tied in with the Medical Industrial Complex which is similar in many ways to the Military Industrial Complex - which President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us about. Western medicine has developed countless miracle drugs and procedures. However, in many areas of health and medicine simple non-invasive, inexpensive techniques are not only overlooked and not researched but may even be illegal. Medical doctors who look into some of these techniques and promote them may have their licenses revoked and may even be imprisoned. One only has to read a few books on cancer cures the medical profession does not want you to know about to become quite angry at what seems to be going on. If this sounds like paranoia please see the film 'Hoxey, Quacks Who Cure Cancer'. Or learn a little about the incredible suppression of the research into alternative cancer cures suffered by Stanislaw R. Burzynski, MD, PhD. These alternative therapies may or may not be effective but when you read about how vicious and aggressive the FDA, the AMA and other agencies has been about suppressing even harmless research into these alternatives you will see that one Bill Of Rights our Founding Fathers should have added was Medical Choice. The chiropractic profession is often associated with medical alternatives. However, it has been our experience that although there are a small percentage of chiropractors that have been using inversion therapy for decades to help their patients, the chiropractic industry and chiropractic colleges have willfully and intentionally ignored this extraordinary therapy for more than 40 years because it was perceived as a threat to their practices. Dr. Robert Martin a chiropractor himself as well as a doctor of osteopathic medicine was heavily promoting inversion therapy in the 1970's. Instead of viewing it as a benefit to their patients the chiropractic industry viewed it as a threat to their incomes. It would not have been seen as a threat if it did not work. Now that they have the DRX 9000, the Spine Med Decompression system and other decompression machines where they can charge a lot for the therapy they are promoting Decompression Therapy as one of the greatest therapies ever developed. Well, what do they think inversion therapy does? And we know the chiropractic colleges knew about inversion therapy going back at least to 1980 when our company demonstrated it to some of the major colleges. Yet we know that even to this day most chiropractic colleges will not even mention it to their students. Up until the late 1970's or so traction was still very common in medical hospitals. Then everything changed when drugs and surgery became the rage and the medical profession who had been using weighted decompressions therapy commonly for hundreds or even thousands of years all but forgot that simple traction is often the best therapy for compressed disc problems. Disc compression is a mechanical problem and simple gravity inversion therapy is a mechanical solution. Our company has heard from many people who had been taking analgesics such as oxycontin, oxycodone, percocet, percodan, dilaudid and other narcotics and have been able to reduce their pain enough using inversion therapy to wean themselves from these drugs. One person we spoke with got such rapid pain relieving results from her inversion table that she had to be hospitalized to get off the narcotic drugs she was addicted to for her pain. Even Dr. Dean Edel who has a national radio program and says he follows the evidence and research is amazingly naive about the benefits of traction and inversion therapy. It is stunning to those in the field of inversion therapy who have been seeing the benefits to those suffering with compressed discs, degenerative discs, ruptured discs and other issues being helped by inversion therapy and then to hear Dr. Dean Edel on the radio say the research shows the decompression therapy, traction therapy and inversion therapy are no better that just letting time pass and the problem will just go away. The amazing ignorance of this attitude makes us question the veracity of Dr. Dean Edel's other positions on serious health issues. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people have avoided surgery (or avoided their next surgery), been able to get off narcotics and in other ways improved the quality of their lives using inversion therapy and someone as well read as Dr. Dean Edel is telling millions of people that it does not work. We at energycenter.com have worked with orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, chiropractors, sports medicine doctors and other health professionals since 1980. And talk with speak with people who have received magnificent results using inversion tables as well as those recommended to our company by people who swear by inversion therapy. For about 30 years we have witnessed in our showrooms and in doctors offices and well as results on x-rays and MRI's that when Dr. Dean Edel and others question the effectiveness of this simple, logical, inexpensive, safe and effective therapy we feel they are doing a grave disservice to those suffering with this problem. Disc herniations, sciatica etc. are largely a mechanical problem - COMPRESSION and inversion therapy is a mechanical solution - DECOMPRESSION that if done properly and safely can have amazing results. If used in conjunction with proper exercises to balance and stabilize the pelvic region the results can be effective and long lasting. We have been hearing about the fantastic results people are having with inversion therapy nearly every single day since 1980. Now that the military is actively using inversion therapy we have had reports from soldiers being able to get back on their feet after a back or neck injury that otherwise would have ended their careers. We at energycenter.com have seen inversion therapy help MMA fighters with back and neck injuries as well. So those who state categorically that it does not help are either intentionally deceiving people or have not done proper research. In 30 years we have not heard of or read one single inversion therapy study that did not show positive results. • Sheffield, F.: Adaptation of Tilt Table for Lumbar Traction. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 45: 469-472, 1964. 175 patients who were unable to work due to back pain were treated. After eight inversion treatments, 155 patients were able to return to their jobs full time. Study concluded that the main basis for improvement was the stretching of paraspinal vertebral muscles and ligaments and possibly the widening of intravertebral discs. Study found significant improvements in a variety of diagnosis including spondylolisthesis, herniated discs, lumbar osteoarthritis with sciatica, and coccygodynia. Patient experienced traction in a modified hip flexed position. It is worth noting that previous to his use of inversion therapy, Dr. Sheffield regularly used mechanical traction with weights and pulleys. He considered inverted traction much more effective than mechanical traction. • Nosse, L.: Inverted Spinal Traction. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 59: 367-370, Aug 78. Study found emg activity (an indicator of muscle pain) declined 35% within the first 10 seconds of inversion. Study found that inversion increases the spinal length. Study concluded there is a correlation between a reduction in emg activity and an increase in spinal length. • Gianakopoulos, G, et al: Inversion Devices: Their Role in Producing Lumbar Distraction. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 66: 100-102, Feb 85. Study found all subjects experienced intravertebral separation in the lower lumbar vertebrae. Study concluded that although mechanical traction has been used for centuries, only gravity assisted traction (inversion) offers an effective means of achieving pelvic traction at home. • Ballantyne, Byron, et al: The Effects of Inversion Traction on Spinal Column Configuration, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Perceived Discomfort. Jour of Orthopedic Sports Phys Ther. 254-260, Mar 86. Study concluded that inversion can be an effective means of spinal traction. Subjects inverting in the hip flexed position experienced greater separation between the lumbar vertebrae. • Kane, M, et al: Effects of Gravity-facilitated Traction on Intravertebral Dimensions of the Lumbar Spine. Jour of Orthopedic and Sports Phys Ther. 281-288, Mar 85. Study found gravity-facilitated traction (inversion), produces significant intravertebral separation in lumbar spine. Study concluded gravity facilitated traction may be an effective modality in the relief of low back pain. • Goldman, R, et al: The Effects of Oscillating Inversion on Systemic Blood Pressure, Pulse, Intraocular Pressure, and Central Retinal Arterial Pressure. The Physician and Sports Medicine. 13: 93-96, Mar 85. Study concluded that full inversion using oscillation procedure presents no risk to normotensive healthy subjects. • Dimberg, L, et al: Effects of gravity-facitliated traction of the lumbar spine in persons with chronic low back pain at the workplace. 116 people were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial which lasted for 12 months. A randomized controlled trial with two training groups and one control group was conducted to asses the effect of gravity inversion on pain level and absenteeism due to LBP. Average age = 44 years. 77% men Group 1: used inversion for 10 minutes 1/day Group 2: used inversion for 10 minutes 2/day Group 3: control group Results after 12 months of training program: 1. The employees in Group 1 and 2 decreased sick days due to back pain by 33%. 2. Average sick days to due back pain fell by 8 days per individual in the treated group. 3. ""Inversion is an efficient and cheap way to improve employee health and possibly reduce sick day costs to the employer."" • Nachemson, Alf, et al: Intravital Dynamic Pressure Measurements in Lumbar Discs. 1970. Study measured internal disc pressure (in the 3rd lumbar disc) through a range of activities, including standing, sitting, bending and vertical and supine traction. The study suggests that a traction load of 60% body weight is sufficient to reduce the residual pressure of 25% standing body weight to zero. • After several years of evaluation, the US Army Physical Fitness School has decided to incorporate Inversion into its world-wide physical training doctrine. The Army Rangers at Fort Benning, GA use gravity boots to invert, ""reversing"" the damage done to their bodies during their demanding training. To them, Inversion represents the ""Quiet Side of Fitness""-a restorative fitness tool to help decompress and mobilize joints to prevent injuries. Soldiers use gravity boots to stretch while inverted, moving joints through their full range of motion. Medical Studies on the 90/90 Inverted Position As in using the DEX � decompression & extensionTM • Vernon, H.: Inversion therapy: a study of physiological effects. The Journal of CCA 29: 138-140. Sep 85. Study found a general reduction of emg (an indicator of muscle pain) after three minutes of inversion. Study found the flattening of the lumbar spine involved a stretching of spinal muscles and ligaments which lead to a 25% increase in forward spinal flexion. Study found significant intravertebral separation (posterior and anterior). Study concluded that an inversion chair may be sufficient to reduce the majority of intravertebral disc protrusions. Study concluded that the cardiovascular system (heart rate and blood pressure) remained stable through three minutes of seated partial inversion. Authors conclude this stability is due to the full comfort and support of the chair during partial inversion. • Meshino, J.: The Role of Spinal Inverted Traction in Chiropractic Practice. ACA Journal of Chiropractic 18:63-68, Feb 84. Study stated the hip flexed position facilitates lumbar traction by flattening the lumbar spine and decreasing the loading effect of the psoas muscle on the lumbar spine during traction. Study stated inversion therapy is preferred over mechanical traction because there is no need for a constricting harness and the safe and simple operation of an inversion chair allows the patient to administer traction. Study stated inversion helps to negate the effect of gravity on the spinal column. Study stated inversion offers promise as a form of prevention, maintenance, and therapy.

Inversion Therapy
Published Medical Studies Show Promise in the Field of Inversion
Researchers have noted:
Patients who were unable to work due to back pain could return to work after using inversion
Inversion reduces the need for sciatica back surgery
Inverted traction is more effective than mechanical traction machines found in doctor's offices
Inversion increases spinal length
Inversion reduces EMG activity (an indicator of muscle pain)
Inverted traction decompresses the lumbar area
Rhythmic traction can lower blood pressure
Inversion reduces disc pressure
Important Medical Studies Relating to How Inversion Could Benefit You
Inversion Therapy in Patients with Pure Single Level Discogenic Disease: a pilot randomized trial. Manjunath Prasad KS, Gregson BA, Hargreaves G, Byrnes T, Mendelow AD. Regional Neurosciences Centre, Newcastle General Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. Patients who were told they needed sciatic operations were divided into two groups. One group regularly practiced inversion therapy along with regular physiotherapy, while the other practiced physiotherapy alone. Authors stated, ""Inversion therapy decreased the need for an operation in sciatica due to single level disc protrusion to 23% as compared to 78% in the non-inversion group.""
The results showed that patients who practiced inversion were 70.5% less likely to require surgery.
Sheffield, F.: Adaptation of Tilt Table for Lumbar Traction. Arch Phys Med Rehabilitation; 45: 469-472, 1964. 175 patients who were unable to work due to back pain were treated. After eight inversion treatments, 155 patients were able to return to their jobs full time. Study concluded that the main basis for improvement was the stretching of paraspinal vertebral muscles and ligaments and possibly the widening of intravertebral discs.
Study found significant improvements in a variety of diagnosis including spondylolisthesis, herniated discs, lumbar osteoarthritis with sciatica, and coccygodynia. Patient experienced traction in a modified hip flexed position.
It is worth noting that previous to his use of inversion therapy, Dr. Sheffield regularly used mechanical traction with weights and pulleys. He considered inverted traction much more effective than mechanical traction.
Nosse, L.: Inverted Spinal Traction. Arch Phys Med Rehabilitation; 59: 367-370, Aug 78.
Study found EMG activity (an indicator of muscle pain) declined 35% within the first 10 seconds of inversion. Study found that inversion increases the spinal length. Study concluded there is a correlation between a reduction in EMG activity and an increase in spinal length.
Gianakopoulos, G, et al: Inversion Devices: Their Role in Producing Lumbar Distraction. Arch Phys Med Rehabilitation; 66: 100-102, Feb 85.
Study found all subjects experienced intravertebral separation in the lower lumbar vertebrae. Study concluded that although mechanical traction has been used for centuries, only gravity-assisted traction (inversion) offers an effective means of achieving pelvic traction at home.
Ballantyne, Byron, et al: The Effects of Inversion Traction on Spinal Column Configuration, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Perceived Discomfort. Jour. of Orthopedic Sports Phys. Ther. 254-260, Mar 86.
Study concluded that inversion can be an effective means of spinal traction. Subjects inverting in the hip flexed position experienced greater separation between the lumbar vertebrae.
Kane, M, et al: Effects of Gravity-facilitated Traction on Intravertebral Dimensions of the Lumbar Spine. Jour of Orthopedic and Sports Phys Ther. 281-288, Mar 85.
Study found gravity-facilitated traction (inversion), produces significant intravertebral separation in lumbar spine. Study concluded gravity facilitated traction may be an effective modality in the relief of low back pain.
Goldman, R, et al: The Effects of Oscillating Inversion on Systemic Blood Pressure, Pulse, Intraocular Pressure, and Central Retinal Arterial Pressure. The Physician and Sports Medicine. 13: 93-96, Mar 85.
Study concluded that full inversion using oscillation procedure presents no risk to normotensive healthy subjects.
Dimberg, L, et al: Effects of gravity-facilitated traction of the lumbar spine in persons with chronic low back pain at the workplace.
116 people were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial which lasted for 12 months. A randomized controlled trial with two training groups and one control group was conducted to asses the effect of gravity inversion on pain level and absenteeism due to LBP.
Average age = 44 years. 77% men
Group 1: used inversion for 10 minutes 1/day
Group 2: used inversion for 10 minutes 2/day
Group 3: control group
Results after 12 months of training program 1: The employees in Group 1 and 2 decreased sick days due to back pain by 33%. Program 2: Average sick days to due back pain fell by 8 days per individual in the treated group. Program 3: ""Inversion is an efficient and cheap way to improve employee health and possibly reduce sick day costs to the employer.""
Nachemson, Alf, et al: Intravital Dynamic Pressure Measurements in Lumbar Discs. 1970.
Study measured internal disc pressure (in the 3rd lumbar disc) through a range of activities, including standing, sitting, bending and vertical and supine traction. The study suggests that a traction load of 60% body weight is sufficient to reduce the residual pressure of 25% standing body weight to zero.

Frequently Asked Questions
How To Relieve Back Pain
There’s a 90% chance that a person will experience at least one bout of incapacitating back pain at least once in his or her life. Needless to say, there are a lot of people looking for solutions for that burning question: “How to relieve back pain?”
There are many different forms of back pain-relief solutions out there, however most of the solutions require some type of invasive procedure, mechanical traction, or surgery.
Inversion Therapy
Inversion therapy has been widely recognized as one of the leading forms of back pain treatment for the past 30 years. Using an inversion table uses a gentle, passive form of decompression that relaxes the muscles in the spine, relieves pressure on all the weight bearing joints in your body, and relaxes tense muscles. This progressive form of traction allows the joints and discs in your back to be decompressed by the same weight that compresses it while upright.
To understand how to relieve back pain, you must first understand what is truly causing the pain and discomfort.
The discs in your back are made up of soft tissue full of fluid and nutrients, much like small sponges, acting like shock absorbers for your spine. When you go through normal daily activities such as walking, running, bending over, exercising, or even sitting down, these sponge-like discs begin to expel fluid and nutrients, thus decreasing their ability to absorb gravity-induced compression on the spine.
The average person loses two inches of height by the time he reaches seventy years old, and gravity-induced compression is the culprit. To get a better understanding of the daily impact of compression, you can just measure your height and waistline in the morning, then again right before you go to bed. The average person loses a half-inch to three quarters of an inch of height throughout the day! The compression put on the weight-bearing joints causes the nutrients inside the soft tissue of the discs to be expelled. Daily height loss is also evidenced in your increased waistline - gravity compresses the body throughout the day causing your body mass to shift toward your waist.
How To Relieve Back Pain The Natural Way
Teeter Hang Ups has been providing inversion therapy as an answer to the question of how to relieve back pain for over 30 years now. Using a Teeter inversion table can help reduce back pain in four main ways: rehydrating the discs, reducing nerve pressure, realigning the spine, and relaxing tense muscles. There have been numerous studies showing the overwhelming effects of a Teeter on how to relieve back pain. These studies have noted that using a Teeter helped in many ways such as:
89% of patients who were unable to work due to back pain were able to return to work after using inversion.
Inversion reduced the need for sciatica back surgery.
Inverted traction is more effective than mechanical traction machines found in doctor’s offices.
Inversion reduces EMG activity – an indicator of muscle pain.
Rhythmic traction such as inversion can lower blood pressure.

Back Pain Relief using Traction Therapy Dr. Steve Wilson Brandon Chiropractor
Back Pain Relief using Traction Therapy
Dr. Steve Wilson Brandon Chiropractor explains
Back pain commonly results from pressure on the joints, disc, or nerves of the low back. It just stands to make sense if compression or pressure is one of the major causes of back pain, relieving that pressure would relieve back pain.
This is exactly why traction therapy can be very successful in the treatment of back pain.
Traction for back pain therapy is a medical device in which the patient is gently strapped into a harness. The pelvis in one harness and the rib cage in another. The patient lays face up on a therapy table.
The traction therapy gently separates or pulls apart. There is just enough traction force to relieve joint, disc, or spinal nerve related pressure. In doing so helping to relieve the back pain.
If your suffering from back pain and live in the Brandon FL area, give our office a call. Traction may just be the solution to your back pain relief.

Car Injury Mistake Not Hire Attorney Brandon Chiropractor
Car Injury Mistake Not Hire Attorney Brandon Chiropractor
A common question I get is should I hire a car injury attorney
Frequently patients who have been involved in a car accident injury will ask me if I think they should hire an attorney. My answer is almost always a resounding YES.
The reason for the yes is their are many complicated car insurance laws and they change regularly. It is a specialtyof it’s own just because of the complexity of the law.
So I recommend to my patients to hire a competent car injury attorney to protect their legal rights.
Some patients feel the financial cut the car injury attorney will take may not be worth the expense. In my opinion this is not the case. In fact most cases settle for a larger amount with an attorney than without one.
So save yourself the headache of trying to learn car injury law on the run. Hire a car injury attorney.

After a strenuous workout followed by a round of golf, I suddenly experienced severe back pain which radiated down my right leg- to the point that I could not walk. After an MRI and X-rays I was diagnosed with 3 conditions: spinal stenosis (a narrowing in the spine), a bulging disk and spondylolisthesis (a condition in which a vertebra in the lower part of the spine slips out of the proper position) – all at L4-L5. I received 3 epidural injections to alleviate the immediate inflammation, enabling me to walk, albeit with a cane and continued pain. I also began physical therapy. After a few months I was referred to a surgeon who felt that surgery was a lifestyle choice and that I would have a very positive result if the spinal cord was given more room and then fused with screws and a bone graft to stabilize the spondylolisthesis.
The thought of back surgery scared me – there are many risks and no guarantees. And one risk of fusion is that it could stress the surrounding vertebrae – potentially requiring future operations. With this information I was determined to do all that I could to avoid surgery. I am so thankful that my friend referred me to Dr. Schwartz.
I can gladly report that after several months of spinal decompression treatments and adjustments I was able to return to my active lifestyle of walking, hiking, skiing and golfing. I still see Dr. Schwartz on a weekly basis for maintenance treatments and he is proactive in recommending exercises to further improve my condition.
Dr. Schwartz is very knowledgeable and caring. He truly wants his patients to be able to return to the activities they love. My advice to you is: invest the time in chiropractic treatments. I am so grateful that have I trusted Dr. Schwartz with my back and avoided surgery. I highly recommend him to you.
Sincerely,
- Jill
I first injured my back in high school, many more years ago than I care to share, during a cheerleading competition. The injury, located in the upper part of my back, was a constant nagging pain throughout the years that followed. While uncomfortable, it was generally bearable, but when the ugly stress-monster began to rear its head (as it is wont to do), the pain grew to the point where I would be popping ibuprofen like it was my job.
A colleague of mine told me about Dr. Schwartz and The Back Care Center when I one day mentioned to him that I was considering chopping my head off if I couldn’t get rid of the pain. He told me that he had seen Dr. Schwartz for a while, and that at the very least, he would be able to provide an alternative to self-decapitation.
My colleague was right. Within a few months, I went from seeing Dr. Schwartz three times a week to once a week. Not only did the pain begin to subside, but Dr. Schwartz taught me important exercises and habits to strengthen weak muscles, which led to my pain. This aspect of treatment is key: Dr. Schwartz doesn’t necessarily treat the pain, he treats the cause of the pain, which is, in the long run, far more important.
- Tabitha Fritz
Thanks to a high school swimming injury, I’ve been seeing chiropractors for most of my life. But only one, Dr. Dave, was able to get me to the point where I could stop going regularly and just go in for the occasional tune-up. Now he adjusts me, and my wife, and my daughter, who he’s been adjusting since she was a baby. On the rare occasions that I’ve needed an adjustment while traveling far away from New Jersey, I get reminded why I’ve stayed with Dave for all these years: not all chiropractors are created equally.

Spinal Traction is a non-surgical therapy to help alleviate nerve root
compression, aiding with the relief and recovery of lower back and leg pain or neck and arm
pain. Some of the conditions that may be causing these symptoms include
herniated, protruding or bulging discs, spinal stenosis, sciatica or
radiculopathy.
Traction is the distraction or separation of the joint surfaces by gently applying forces pulling them apart thus relieving pressure on the skeletal system. Spinal Traction can be applied manually by the Burnaby Physiotherapist or mechanically by a traction machine.
Excessive forces to the neck or lower back may cause exacerbation of your symptoms therefore we usually take a more cautious approach and try Manual Traction before progressing to Mechanical Traction.

The Westminster Chiropractor to see - Chiropractor Westminster
Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is Spinal Decompression Therapy? Spinal decompression therapy is a non-surgical, comfortable traction therapy for the relief of back and leg pain or neck and arm pain. During this procedure, by cycling through distraction and relaxation phases and by proper positioning, a spinal disc can be isolated and placed under negative pressure, causing a vacuum effect within it. What can this vacuum effect do? The vacuum effect accomplishes two things. From a mechanical standpoint, disc material that has protruded or herniated outside the normal confines of the disc can be pulled back within the disc by the vacuum created within the disc. Also, the vacuum within the disc stimulates in growth of blood supply, secondarily stimulating a healing response. This results in pain reduction and proper healing at the injured site. What machine is used for this purpose? There are a number of spinal decompression machines presently used in the United States. After significant research, Dr. Puritz has chosen to use the TX1 machine manufactured by Chattanooga, Inc., the premier manufacturer of physical therapy machines. Who can benefit from Spinal Decompression Therapy?Spinal decompression therapy is designed to unload the spinal disc. Any back pain or neck pain caused in whole or in part by a damaged disc may be helped by spinal decompression therapy. These conditions include herniated, protruding or bulging discs, spinal stenosis, sciatica or radiculopathy (pinched nerves). Are there conditions where Spinal Decompression is not indicated?Spinal decompression therapy is usually not recommended for pregnant women, or patients who have severe osteoporosis, severe obesity or severe nerve damage. It is not recommended for patients over 70. However, every patient is evaluated on an individual basis. Spinal surgery with instrumentation (screws and metal plates or �cages�) is also contraindicated. Surgery to the discs without fusion or fusion using bony replacement is not contraindicated.How often do I take treatment sessions? How long does each session last?Each session includes decompression therapy and spinal stabilization exercises and takes about 1 hour. Spinal decompression is usually performed 3-5 times a week for 15-20 sessions. What are the results of Spinal Decompression Therapy?Over 70% of patients have good pain relief. This success rate is similar to surgical results. I have had spinal surgery, but continue to have pain. Can I try Spinal Decompression Therapy? Spinal decompression therapy can help people with back pain after failed spinal surgery. It can be performed in most patients who have not been left with an unstable spine after surgery.How can I be scheduled for Spinal Decompression Therapy? Simply call our office at 410-848-8022 and tell the receptionist that you are interested in decompression therapy. An initial consultation can usually be scheduled within 48 hours.Make an AppointmentEmail Doctor

What's the difference between sick care and health care?
Sick care is largely about relieving or suppressing symptoms. Health care is about improving performance. While sick care is about how you feel, health care is about how you function. Sick care is what you do to treat an obvious problem, and health care is what you do to avoid the problem and advance your well-being.
What's a side effect?
It may sound like a bonus; something extra, but chiropractors know it should more accurately called an ""unintended effect,"" and ""unwanted effect"" or in some cases an ""adverse effect."" A pill can't come close to matching your body's ability to create and deliver the essential compounds it needs. That's when it's important to make sure your nervous system is working correctly�the purpose of chiropractic care!

�Discover How This New Unique Procedure Has Been Shown To Quickly And Easily
Resolves 86% of Back Pain And The Breakthrough Medical Technology That�s Bringing It To YOU!�
Dear Back Pain Sufferer,
There is a very good reason why thousands of former back pain sufferers are calling non-surgical spinal decompression the �eighth wonder of the world.�
This amazing new medical breakthrough, is responsible for cracking the back pain code for thousands of FORMER pain sufferers. Many previously tried everything and were thought to be hopeless cases. So many that were told � �We�ve done all we can do for you, you�re just going to have to live with the pain,� are now pain free.
Imagine living the rest of your life pain free.
Imagine waking up tomorrow morning with your back pain GONE.
Imagine how much easier your life would be if you could just be pain free�. once and for all!
Countless failed back surgery patients have finally found relief after surgery made them worse. With this new technology, it�s obvious they may have never needed surgery in the first place.
Clinical studies have shown non-surgical spinal decompression to be successful (good or excellent relief) in 86% of patients with herniated discs and degenerative joint disease � without the side effects.
The most amazing thing is:
One study also showed a 90% reduction in disc herniations in 71.4% of patients.
Herniated discs were thought to be just about untreatable without surgery before the introduction of this incredible new technology.
Even better, treatment with this space-age non-surgical technology is pain-less, drugless and there are no documented side effects. And best of all�Results are much better.
The Triton 550 has been approved by �The Food and Drug Administration��
You�ve gotten to know them as the �FDA�.
The main conditions the decompression has documented success with are: back pain, sciatica, herniated and or bulging discs (single or multiple), degenerative disc disease or relapse or failure following surgery.
A very important note: The spinal decompression has been successful with even the most severe cases� even when NOTHING else has worked. Even after failed surgery.
But if you want to give my system and the Triton 550 a try (as long as you qualify and I have an opening) you can take it for a test spin without risking a single penny!
How Would You Like To Check Out This Amazing New Technology And See If You Qualify For Treatment� Absolutely Free?
Call today and get your FREE spinal decompression evaluation ($125 value).
NO COST OR OBLIGATION!

Spinal Decompression
Safe and effective, non-surgical relief from nagging neck or back pain.
Spinal Decompression is an alternative medical technology designed to help relieve your cervical (neck) or lumbar (low-back) pain. Clinical studies of Spinal Decompression � also referred to as non-surgical spinal decompression therapy � are reporting that more than 70% of patients show significant reduction of pain. A percentage reports the elimination of pain. Thousands of people across the country are enjoying the benefits of this treatment. We�re eager to help you learn if you too are a candidate for this treatment method.
Spinal Decompression is a safe and effective treatment for pain without the risks associated with surgery, anesthesia, infection, injections, or prescription medication. As you might imagine, this procedure is rapidly gaining in popularity due to its exceptional results in treating chronic back pain without surgery.
Our procedures use FDA-approved equipment only. Simply described, this method of treatment uses a therapeutic table that is connected to a computer, to electronically distract and decompress your spinal structures. You rest on the table while a padded harness focuses the gentle distractive force along your spinal column. This decompresses your spine � specifically the intervertebral discs and joints and stretches your spinal muscles � the three structures that produce most of your pain.
Prior to beginning treatments, we evaluate you to determine if you are a candidate. Your medical history, x-rays, CT/MRI scans are carefully reviewed. If you are a candidate for care, an individual treatment plan is created for your specific needs. A typical plan may be as few as 15-20 treatments � and thus the full healing process � even if you start to feel improvement early on. It is not uncommon to experience a significant reduction of pain early in your treatments.
At the beginning of each session, you are fitted with a comfortable harness designed to offer optimal decompression. You are fully dressed, and a specially trained technician will make sure that you are properly positioned for comfort, safety and effectiveness. The computer is programmed in accordance with your specific treatment plan, and your session commences. Additionally you are in complete control and can shut down the treatment at any time if discomfort should occur.
During each session, you experience multiple cycles of distraction/relaxation, which may take 15-20 minutes. The equipment is designed to apply precisely controlled tension along the axis of our spinal column, creating decompression of the intervertebral discs. The process is fully automated and administered by a computer, which in turn is monitored by an attending technician.
During the distraction cycle, you may feel some relief of the pressure in the area where your pain exists. During this time, your body is responding by flooding the area with valuable oxygen, blood and nutrients that help promote your body�s natural healing process.
Your treatment sessions are typically both comfortable and relaxing. At the end of your session, you�re ready to head home!
Schedule your initial exam today and find out if you�re a candidate

Spinal Decompression Experiences
�Have been diagnosed with ruptured discs in my lower spine, I was in constant pain. A renowned surgeon stated that my only recourse was to have back surgery to correct the condition. He sent me home with a prescription for pain medicine and told me to let him know when I was ready for the surgery. I made an appointment for a free consultation on spinal decompression and began treatment with almost instant results. To say the least, this treatment gave me back my life; as I was contemplating having to give up my job. What a blessing!� E.M.
�Just wanted to let you know what decompression has done for me. When I first decided to go, I thought, �can�t hurt � worth trying� and it certainly has been. My back was hurting all the time, and now after a few treatments I am free of pain. This is so much better than surgery.� E.C.
�I have experienced serious back problems for more years than I care to remember. I have been under the care of a chiropractor for 15 years-plus, sometimes requiring adjustments as many as 3 times per week to be able to function. It was recently confirmed through an MRI that I have 4 bulging discs in my lower back as well as stenosis of the central canal. Just a few days after being diagnosed on ad was in the paper describing a new procedure. I have had four treatments and the results are unbelievable!!! I can actually get out of bed in the morning PAINFREE, something I had not experienced for years and something I did not expect to be able to do without surgery. I�m sold!� L.S.
�I am 38 years old. I have been an active person all my life. This summer, I was landscaping around my home when I experienced lower back pain. In the past, I would see my massage therapist for those hurting muscles and I would be right back to my work and play. This time, the pain was running down my left leg and into my foot. The pain was causing me to miss work. I went to my M.D. and he prescribed pain meds and muscle relaxers. That was all he could do for me. The disc in my lower back was putting pressure on the nerve, causing pain and numbness in my left foot. I started the decompression treatment plan and I was back on my feet in three days and back to work the following week. I continue to follow the treatment plan and I have been growing stronger. In the next month, I expect to have full use of my back, with no more pain. It has been a great experience and I would refer decompression to my family and friends.� D.H.
�My lower back in degenerative and has became increasingly more debilitating to the point where it produced pain in my leg and affected the way I walked, (like an old lady). I was ready to accept this condition as an inevitable part of the aging process. Finally I did seek medical treatment options from an orthopedic surgeon. I was told about options ranging from physical therapy and injections to possible surgery. I have been receiving decompression and strengthening exercises for several weeks now. The results have been nothing short of amazing. The treatments are totally relaxing and the strengthening component produces a feeling of well-being. It makes sense � and the results indicate that the body can restore itself with non-invasive methods.� S.G.
�I am a 55 year old man, who has been suffering with lower back pain for approximately 10 years. I have been to medical doctors who offered drugs, physical therapy and cortisone shots to alleviate the pain in my spine. These methods helped for a very short time (a couple of days in most instances), but the pain returned. I have been to the chiropractor for adjustments and have even tried acupuncture. Again, the pain returned. The pain was so bad that when I coughed, it would bring tears to my eyes and I would go to my knees, I had to hold onto something to prevent this from happening. My place of employment had me on disability because I could no longer function. One month after starting decompression, I am back at work and have full strength in my back. It�s a pleasure not to be experiencing pain. Thank you.� L.W.

The Agency of Health Care Policy and Research Study
On December 8, 1994, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) of the US Department of Health and Human Services released Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of acute low
back pain. Their guidelines were developed after extensive study of diagnostic and treatment methods for acute low back pain.
The guidelines were created by the AHCPR panel to provide primary care clinicians with information and recommended strategies for the assessment and treatment of acute low back problems. The AHCPR
panel was made up of 23 members consisting of medical doctors, chiropractic doctors, nurses, experts in spinal research, physical therapists, an occupational therapist, a psychologist, and a
consumer representative.
The following conclusions were made in this landmark study:
Conservative treatment such as spinal manipulation should be pursued in most before cases considering surgical intervention;
Prescription drugs such as oral steroids, antidepressant medications and colchicine are not recommended for acute low back problems.
Other interesting finds included:
The risk of serious complications from lumbar spinal manipulation is rare;
There is currently no evidence supporting the use of trigger point, ligamentous and facet injections, needle acupuncture or dry needling as treatment for acute back problems;
The panel found no evidence of benefit from the application of physical agents and modalities such as ice, heat, massage, traction, ultrasound, cutaneous laser treatment, transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (T.E.N.S.) and biofeedback techniques.

Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression
Non-surgical spinal decompression is a safe, comfortable and effective tool used in the treatment of neck and low back injuries including the following: disc bulges, disc herniations, sciatica, pinched nerves, facet syndromes and leg / arm pain. However, not all patients are candidates for spinal decompression traction, each will be properly evaluated and screened to ensure that their condition will respond best to this form of treatment.
Non-surgical spinal decompression has numerous mechanical and physiological effects including: relieving pressure on the nerves, unloading constant force from the spine, decreasing acute disc bulging and inflammation and separating the vertebrae to allow for stretching of the ligaments while relieving pressure on the discs. It also increases the blood flow to the muscle tissues which allows for a deeper relaxation of muscle hypertonicity/spasm.
The Triton DTS traction machine has several decompression traction protocols for the cervical and lumbar spines, which allows for more specificity in each individuals treatment. Patients can lay comfortably on their back or stomach for the lumbar decompression and on their back for cervical decompression. There are several padded harnesses that are attached to the patient to ensure the most efficient traction is reached.
Mechanical spinal decompression traction is quite comfortable and is usually performed over the course of several visits. The cumulative effect of each decompression treatment can be quite dramatic and the results can be truly amazing. However, many patients can feel a noticeable change in their symptomatology after only a few treatments!

A Great Therapy for Back Pain-Spinal Decompression Therapy
Posted on September 12, 2011 by GrandHealth
Do you or someone you know suffer from Back Pain? With September being National Pain Awareness Month I wanted to mention a great therapy we offer at Grand Health Chiropractic & Wellness Center. There is a treatment for pain caused by bulging or herniated spinal discs in the neck and back called spinal disc decompression therapy. The treatment is an alternative to surgery or prolonged treatment with prescription medications for patients.
Medical journal research has placed the effectiveness of spinal disc decompression therapy at 75 to 92 percent with a relapse rate of 2 percent. Many patients have been able to avoid surgery, prolonged treatment with prescription medications, and extended time in pain with spinal disc decompression therapy.
Spinal Decompression Treatment is non-invasive and provides gentle decompression of the disc through the use of a decompression table. You are strapped to the table so that as it moves it applies a distraction force to the targeted area of the spine (the compressed disc). A computer controls the distraction force which is applied in between periods of relaxation. This gently pulls the spine apart elongating it and creating a small vacuum between the vertebrae which pulls the disc back into shape.
Much like a repetitive stress injury the decompression works in very minute increments. But over time that adds up and lets the disc reshape itself, heal and get the proper flow of nutrients going to fight off brittleness and future injuries.
Interested? Ask one of our Doctors if this is a good option for you.

Chronic Pain: you don’t have to adjust your life! Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
One of our many treatments! Intersegmental Traction
On June 30, 2010,
in Acupuncture, Cupping, Intersegmental Traction, Modalities,
by Kenneth Mattos
ShareEarlier today i was asked what other treatments do i offer for back pain, besides other than Acupuncture, and Tui Na, and Cupping. My response was ” We have many other types of modalities to help you relieve your back pain, not just Acupuncture” and Im very glad i was ask this question. I like to explain some patients about one of many modalities that we love to use with our patients, Intersegmental Traction
What is Intersegmental Traction?
It is a way of inducing passive motion into the spine for the purpose of stretching spinal joints, increasing mobility.
How does Intersegmental Traction work?
The patient lies face up on a bench table which has roller-type cams beneath its surface. These rollers can slowly travel the length of the spine, stretching spinal joints.
What does Intersegmental Traction feel like?
Most patients find this form of treatment to be relaxing and very helpful. The gentle rolling action is restful, exercising the spine without effort.
Why is Intersegmental Traction used?
Since discs have a poor blood supply, they get nutrients from the circulation of fluids surrounding spinal joints. Fixations prevent this natural circulation and can cause disc thinning and degeneration. Intersegmental traction helps increase and restore necessary elasticity and motion to the spine. Intersegmental Traction is a particularly useful and effective therapy to treat and help prevent painful muscle spasms and muscle guarding specifically in spinal muscles. This also helps to prevent abnormal wear and tear on the vertebral discs and vertebrae which in turn prevent further injury and reduce the arthritis process.
Patient Benefits
Comfortable and relaxing
Increased mobility
Improves circulation of spinal fluids
Most patients enjoy the relaxing motion and the increased mobility gained from Intersegmental Traction.

“If my discomfort or lower back pain was described as 100% before using LumbaCurve, would say the back pain as 20% afterwards. Very solid – can be re-used again and again if ever needed. Getting it positioned in the correct part of the lower back can be a problem, but it does work. Uncomfortable to begin with but that is to be expected. Would recommend.”

Back Pain Products to help back pain
If you suffer lower back pain, you are not on your own. Probably nearly all adults at some point in their lives will experience low back pain that interferes with their work eg there is a high incidence of back pain in drivers, everyday activities, sports (eg lumbar pain in golfers) or hobbies. Lower back pain or sciatica is considered the most common cause of job-related disability and the highest contributor to absenteeism in the western world. For example, back pain is second to headaches as the most common neurological ailment in the United States. Generally, most occurrences of lower back pain or lumbar pain subside after a few days, although some instances may take much longer to resolve or very occasionally lead to more serious conditions.
Short-term low back pain (Acute) generally lasts from a few days to a few weeks, and this back pain tends to be mechanical in nature, the consequence of trauma to the lower back or a condition such as arthritis. Lower back pain from trauma may be caused by an injury sustained through sports activity, household jobs or working in the garden. Sometimes, sudden jarring from a minor fall, or other stress on the lower back bones and tissues could be the root cause of low back pain or sciatica.
Symptoms of lower back pain may range from aching muscles to shooting or sharp stabbing pain, limited flexibility and/or range of motion, or an inability to stand straight. Sometimes, pain felt in one part of the body may stem from a disorder or injury incurred in other parts of the body. Very occasionally acute low back pain syndromes could become more serious if untreated.
Definitions of what period or duration constitutes chronic low back pain vary but back pain that persists for over 12 weeks would generally be described as chronic. Often the initial cause of the back problem is not known and this condition can sometimes be progressive
The good news is that the vast majority of occurrences of lower back pain can be treated without surgery. Back pain treatments or back pain products include analgesics, to reduce inflammation, to restoring proper mobility and strength to the back, by a variety of back pain products and therapies, to strategies for the avoidance of recurrence of the injury. Usually patients suffering lumbar pain recover fully and don’t incur continuing loss of functionality. It’s advisable to contact your GP if there is no improvement or reduction in the back pain and inflammation after 3 days
There is a plethora of exercises, medication, or back pain therapy products and gadgets available to sufferers of lower back pain designed to provide either back pain relief, prevention or both. Although some of these back pain products (such as Magnatherapy or aromatherapy) would be described as ‘alternative’ or pseudoscientific ie they have few empirically or scientifically proven benefits, many are developed through the application of sound medical principle and theory. It’s worthwhile asking your GP for recommendations on any back pain therapies as well as making sure that the cause of the back pain is not more serious
Back pain therapy products
PGAT devices
Inversion Tables
Inversion is a natural form of passive gravity assisted traction (PGAT) that uses the patient’s body weight in conjunction with gravity to decompress weight-bearing joints to give back pain relief. While the patient is rotated and suspended, gravity effectively creates a traction, resulting in a customized stretch that extends the spine, from the sacroiliac to the cervical joints of the neck, increasing the space between the vertebrae, which relieves the pressure on the discs and nerve roots. By reducing this pressure there is less interference with the spinal nerves thus reducing lower back pain. Inversion is considered to be an effective back pain therapy
This is typically performed on what’s called an inversion table. The table allows you to lie on your back relaxed, in an inverted position. This position eliminates some or all gravitational compression, depending upon how far back you position your body. Inversion therapy relieves back pain, and it works even better when it’s part of a well-rounded back pain therapy plan that addresses the specific muscle imbalances you have. But even by itself it is highly effective. A recent study done at Newcastle University found that over 70% of patients who performed inversion therapy were able to cancel their scheduled back surgeries.
LumbaCurve
LumbaCurve is a new effective lower back pain therapy product which is designed not only to reduce disc compression but to exercise and mobilise the muscles, joints and ligaments of the spine all at the same time, thus giving much neeeded back pain relief. Painstakingly designed over 6 years in the UK and the Netherlands, this ingenious back pain therapy device combines both Western and Eastern therapy techniques.
LumbaCurve incorporates specific shaping and design features which attempt to simulate a range of both occidental physiotherapy / chiropractic, and oriental acupressure techniques employed in mechanical lower back pain relief. LumbaCurve gently stretches the lower back, causing the vertebral discs to separate. This in turn relaxes the discs and frees up the spinal nerves, thus giving low back pain relief. LumbaCurve’s design features also provide the benefits of shiatsu stimulation, yogic stretch, and acupressure massage from traditional oriental medicine.
LumbaCurve is an effective lower back pain therapy device which is simplicity itself to use. Just lie on your back, slide it under your lumbar area… and relax. With minimal effort and time, the results can be extraordinary. Manufactured in the UK, LumbaCurve comes with an instructional DVD of exercise routines and a handy bag to store or transport it so that you could still use it at work or whilst travelling.

CPM Mobilisers
Backlife
Backlife is designed to apply a Continuous Passive Movement (CPM) to the lower back pain sufferer in a similar way to how a healthcare professional, as part of his back pain therapy, would apply in order to help relieve pressure between the vertebrae, and therefore relieve back pain in the lumbar region. In order to apply CPM the user would lie on the floor bending their knees over the upper section of the machine. As the upper section moves, it gently rotates the pelvis in a circular fashion, allowing the joints to move, whilst the joints remain relaxed. The advertised benefits of Backlife for back pain relief are that it reduces the stress and pressure on the lower back, restores back mobility and improves stability. In addition it reduces back pain with regular use, improves posture, and reduces muscle tension. Backlife CPM back pain therapy device
Back in action Mobiliser
The Back in Action Mobiliser is an extremely powerful medical grade spinal joint mobilisation system, available for home or professional use for back pain relief. It’s described as usually very effective at decreasing the symptoms of long term and chronic musculo-skeletal problems.
The system applies very localised pressure to the muscles either side of the spine, simulating a practitioners ‘thumbing technique,whilst mobilising the spine, flexing and extending the spine, freeing up stubborn vertebrae. In addition to this the mobilise provides a continuous passive motion (CPM) considered to be beneficial to health and aid healing
The mobilise has been used to treat conditions such as: lower back pain; prolapse /slipped disc, sciatica; scoliosis, arthritic hips, sacro-iliac dysfunction, whiplash injuries; fibromyalgia and many other disabling conditions.
It is also comprehensively tested and endorsed by medics, so that it is probably the most commended back pain therapy care system available. Its most significant disadvantage is that it is made in small numbers and is expensive to buy however they are available to hire. see the Mobiliser
Backstretcher
The Backstretcher, also known as the Rolastretcher provides back pain relief with a combination of massage and stretching movements, allowing the user to move and stretch different parts of the spine by moving up and down the frame. The rollers also provide pressure (acupressure) on the back muscles either side of the spine where dysfunctional trigger points (knots) often occur. It provides back pain sufferers the opportunity to complement their therapeutic treatment with a device, which is portable, The effectiveness of this back pain therapy device has been confirmed by scientific study by the University of Iowa’s Spine Centre. See it here
Flexibak
Flexibak is back support cradle that is designed to ease lower back pain problems, reduce discomfort, and promote back pain relief, by decompression of key joints, allowing natural movement to return to the user. Flexibak, developed by 2 leading British osteopaths, is designed to encourage the lumbar and sacroiliac joints to open up, and encourage the return of natural movement as pressure on inflamed muscles is relieved. flexibak
Back cushions and wedges and Supports
Cushions
Back cushions: These are custom shaped soft cushions which are tailored to the natural shape of the user’s lower back and designed to offer support whilst maintaining an ergonomical and comfortable posture whilst sat on a chair or in the car, thus providing an element of relief for low back pain.
Seat wedges
Seat wedges provide lower back pain relief in a natural passive manner. Sitting on a seat wedge has the effect of moving forward the pelvis which has the effect of causing the users spine to adopt a more ergonically correct upright posture. Seat wedges maybe useful for lumbar pain suffering car drivers by angling their backs into more comfortable driving positions, or in sedentary workplace situations where the back pain sufferer may be adopting a siiting position for several hours, for example call centre workers. Ideal for everybody working in a sitting position, especially PC users.
A variant of the seat wedge is the coccyx wedge which incorporates a cut away section to reduce or avoid pressure on the sacrum or coccyx which could be causing lower back pain or tail bone pain. Around £20
Back Braces: These aim to constrict the affected area of low back pain low afflicted area, these strap-on body braces help reduce lower back pain and help to correct poor posture. Have a look atBack braces to help back pain
TENS units
TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) is the application of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. In this case we are referring to portable stimulators used to help with back pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes or semi adhesive pads.
Although the first units developed in the US for testing tolerance of chronic back pain sufferers to electrical stimulation in preparation for surgically invasive implants, many patients reported deriving relief from the TENS itself. A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the Meditronic device became known
TENS is regarded as a non-invasive, safe nerve stimulation intended to reduce pain, including lower back pain, both acute and chronic. Controversy does exist over its effectiveness in treating of chronic back pain. In 2007 a feature in the Pain Journal conclude that ENS was effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain whereas the journal Neurology advised against recommending TENS for chronic lower back pain,but other neurologists in the same journal suggested that in some patients TENS is useful. TENS units available from high street retailers such as Boots or Superdrug
Baxolve offers immediate relief for lower back pain through a combination of TENS therapy and lumbar support in one easy to use convenient belt. See Baxolve
Heat and cold back pain products
There is little empirical evidence that the application of hot and cold compresses actually effectively relieve back pain conditions, although the use of hot and cold compresses may provide back pain relief by helping to reduce the lower back pain, spasms, and inflammation, in turn allowing for improved mobility for some back pain sufferers. Immediately after the trauma, the back pain sufferer would apply a cold compress (generally ice packs or refrigerant gel) to the affected area of the lower back pain, maybe after a strain, for up to about 20 minutes a few time a day, for a couple of days to help reduce tissue inflammation. After a couple of days the back pain sufferer would then apply heat to the affected area, using a variety of methods such as heat pads, heat lamps etc for short durations. This has the effect of dilating the blood vessels which increase blood flow to the affected tissues, and encouraging the healing process. It also has the effect of relaxing the muscles similar to having a warm bath after exertion. As with any back pain treatment it’s advisable to consult your GP before commencing a treatment See a range at Back Pain Products
Magnet therapy
Magnet therapy can be described as an alternative or pseudoscientific method of back pain treatment, using magnetic fields on the body to promote back pain relief and healing, with a perceived, though not understood positive effect on blood oxygen content. There is no scientific basis to conclude that small, static magnets can relieve back pain It has its origins in Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM) dating back some 2000 years, centered around ‘Chi’or ‘energy flows’ around the body and instrumental in health and wellbeing, with magnetic wave therapy having associations with acupuncture or and acupressure. Although it is regarded with an element of scepticism due to seemingly physical and biological implausibility, in Eastern countries, therapeutic magnets are licensed as medical devices, and it does appear to be gaining some recognition within the US medical community, with an example of affirmative research of published in the MDBR Journal of Rheumatology. The downside to this is the difficulty associated with establishing true blind testing of magnets and associated ‘placebo or Hawthorne’ effects within test groups. By all means have a look at what’s available but remain sceptical
Ultrasound
Ultrasound is often used as a method of back pain therapy by physios and therapists in combination with other back pain treatments, such as manipulation, massage, ice treatment and interferential (electrotherapy). The ultrasound device causes millions of sound waves to penetrate deep into tissue in order to promote healing of inflamed or damaged muscles, tendons and ligaments. It’s claimed that ultrasound can reduce tissue inflammation by stimulating blood flow, promote healing by stimulating soft tissue, and assist in the absorbtion uf analgesics, and reduce lower back pain. Again there is conflict over the effectiveness for lower back pain treatment with both positive user testimonials offset by inconclusive meta analysis eg Physical Therapy article Jul 2001 andNew Zealand Journal of physiotherapy Jul 2008
Ultralieve
Ultralieve Pro is a mains operated or portable hand held medical grade device designed for home use to help with back pain and promote healing by conducting ultrasound waves into the damaged tissue. Although the device is easy its perhaps best if the user has received ultrasound treatment previously from a physio or heathcare professional, and again it’s advisable to check with your GP or physio before using one to derive back pain relief It should not be used as a replacement for conventional help with back pain but inconjunction with it in between sessions. Again there is conflict over the effectiveness to help with back pain with both positive user testimonials offset by inconclusive meta analysis. More on Ultralieve back pain relief

Chiropractic Treatment of Lumbar Disk Herniation
Over the last few years, it has been recognized in the medical literature that conservative treatment works best for many cases of lumbar disk herniation. For patients with far-lateral, or extreme lateral herniation, however, the effectiveness of conservative care is less certain. This recent case study looked at the outcomes of nonsurgical management of a client with far-lateral disc herniation.
The 60-year-old male client was physically active, and had been seen at a Spine Specialty Center previously for treatment for lower back pain, which resolved. 15 months later, he presented at the Center again with severe back pain (present for 3 weeks), with pain radiating to his right buttock and calf.
Presenting Symptoms:
Score of 73 (out of 100) on the Oswestry Low Back Questionnaire, and Numerical Pain Ratings of 6 (best) to 10 (worst) on a 1-10 scale.
Difficulty transitioning from sitting to standing
Altered gait
Inability to assume erect position
Lateral list to left
Asymmetric static pelvic landmarks (right iliac crest 4 degrees high posteriorly, 2 degrees high anteriorly with standing).
Pain on right side with lateral and backward bends
Initial treatment included manipulation, traction, and passive movements. This was followed up by instruction in self-correction exercises to be followed at home.
Follow-up consisted of:
2 days later: More traction/passive movement and gradual increase in weight bearing, and the patient was fitted with a back brace.
6 days later: manipulation was performed and the patient returned to work part-time. A MRI and surgical consult were also requested during this fourth visit.
The lumbar MRI showed a lateral L5, S1 disc rupture with L5 nerve impingement; due to patient improvement, surgery was deferred. The patient was at work full-time, with his primary complaint sitting intolerance. With consultation, 1 week later a CT-guided transforaminal lumbar epidural and nerve root steroid injection were performed. Three days later, leg pain was reduced and the patient was sleeping better, was working full-time, and was driving.
The patient was then referred to physical therapy for further rehabilitation.
By the end of 4 weeks of physical therapy—8 weeks after being seen initially for the herniation—the patient had achieved scores of 0 on the Numeric Pain Scale, and of 2 (out of 100) on the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire.
During 2 follow-up visits at 14 weeks and 20 weeks after the initial complaint, all scores were 0. The patient was exercising by running or alternatively using a stair climbing machine with no pain, and continuing his stabilization exercises. He was asymptomatic 1 year later at follow-up.
The study authors also note that this patient responded well to nonsurgical intervention, but was very fit, motivated, and compliant with treatment. The case study did demonstrate the fact that a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment seems most effective: from manipulation and passive motion/traction, to epidural steroid injection once the effectiveness of these first interventions had plateaued, followed up by physical therapy and ongoing exercises.

Searching For Spinal Surgery

In the world of back surgery, there are what are called “home run” procedures and then there are sometimes “strike outs”.
Contraindications to Spinal Decompression Therapy
Spinal Decompression Therapy is a revolutionary treatment involving intermittent traction which can help relieve, back pain, neck pain, arm and leg pain. Developed in the 1990’s, it has grown tremendously in popularity as more and more patients realize the benefits of pain relief and surgery avoidance. It is highly effective (over 80%), low cost (less than 5% the cost of surgery), FDA cleared, and very safe with an extremely low risk profile.
The same is typical for surgery for spinal stenosis. A laminectomy is a very good operation for leg pain, but does not help much with leg pain. In fact, a typical complication in 50% of patients after a laminectomy is resultant back stiffness and pain.
Surgery for a degenerative disc, however, is a different story. That should be considered somewhere between a strike out and a home run, we’ll call it a ground rule double.
There are some patients who are not candidates for spinal decompression however. Common problems that benefit include lumbar disc herniation, cervical disc herniation, facet syndrome, failed spine surgery, ruptured discs, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, and spinal stenosis.
If a surgery is of considerable magnitude, such as an adult degenerative scoliosis operation, complication rates approach 70%. Success rates are usually over 75%, but looking at the complication profile the decision for surgery needs to be made very carefully. Has the patient tried physical therapy? What about chiropractic treatment, pain management injections like facet injections, spinal decompression therapy, pain medications?
Spinal decompression therapy has saved many people from spinal surgery. According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, surgery is no more effective than non-invasive treatments, including chiropractic care, for patients with lumbar disc herniation causing sciatica.
However, if a patient has had a previous spinal fusion with instrumentation then spinal decompression is contraindicated. The concern is the unlikely event that the instrumentation may shift. However, at times the end result is no pain even though the fusion did not occur and the instrumentation is holding the bones together. The intermittent traction from the neck decompression, even though slight, could cause a screw to shift and the plate to move.

Here's the TruthAbout Curing Your Diabetes!
Cinnamon and Diabetes
New studies carried out by various universities of United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has found that just half a teaspoon of cinnamon into the daily diet of a diabetics can significantly reduce blood sugar levels. The effect can even be produce by soaking a cinnamon stick in you coffee or tea which can help to prevent and combat diabetes.
The discovery of cinnamon in combating diabetes was made by accident. Researchers were looking at the effects of common foods on blood sugar levels, and one of these foods that were look at was the old American favorite, apple pie, which is commonly spiced up with cinnamon.
As a process which our bodies do naturally, the sugars and starches in food we eat are broken down into glucose. Then it is circulated in the blood. The hormones insulin then makes cells that take in the glucose, to be used as energy or made into fat.
Individual with type 1 diabetes do not produce enough insulin and those with type 2 diabetes produce it, but loses the sensitivity to it. Studies have shown even healthy people, especially those who are overweight, inactive, or over the ages of 25, lose the sensitivity to insulin. By having too much glucose in circulating in the blood can cause serious long term damages to the eyes (blindness), kidneys (kidneys failure), nerves, and other organs.
It was found that cinnamon itself has insulin-like activity and it contains an active ingredient, water-soluble polyphenol compound MHCP. In the laboratory experiments, MHCP imitate insulin, triggers its receptor, and works synergistically with insulin cells. This suggests that cinnamon has a bio-active component that lead to researchers to believe that is has the potential to prevent or overcome diabetes.
Revealed: The Shocking Truth About Diabetes!
Tests have been carried out on two groups of volunteers with type 2 diabetes over a period of 40 days. One group was a controlled group and the other groups were given one, three, or six grams of cinnamon powder in capsules a day after meals. Within weeks they all responded with blood sugar levels that were on average 20% lower that a control group. Some individuals even achieved a normal blood sugar levels. When cinnamon capsules were stopped blood sugar levels started to increased.
Another additional benefit of cinnamon seen in the volunteers is that it also lowered blood levels of fats and bad cholesterol, which are also to some degree controlled by insulin.
The active ingredient is not in cinnamon oils, but in the powdered spice which can be added to toast, cereal, juice, tea or coffee. It is not recommended that eating more cinnamon buns, or even more apple pie as they contain too much fat and sugar. The solution is to add cinnamon to what you would eat normally.

Herbal and Dietary Supplements for Diabetes
Posted on Sep 14, 2011 under Healthy Advocacy | 2 Comments
The worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus has been increasing in recent years and the Philippines is no exception. While there has been an increase of available medications, these are beyond the means of many Filipinos.
The folkloric use of herbal medications has been with us for a long time. Herbal medications are generally thought to be safe because it is derived from natural sources. The reader is forewarned that this impression can lead to a false sense of security. As we have learned from Western medicine, adverse effects are dependent on the dose (of the main and other ingredients), number and amount of impurities, and any concomitant food or drug intake. Absence of data on adverse effects is not the same as absence of adverse effects.
The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of the United States of America lists the following supplements that have been used for diabetes, with a focus on some that have been studied in clinical trials, such as alpha-lipoic acid, chromium, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols. Other supplements listed include garlic, magnesium, coenzyme Q10, ginseng, vanadium, prickly pear cactus, gurmar, Coccinia indica, aloe vera, fenugreek, and bitter melon.
Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a very important micronutrient found in food (especially high in spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes) and sold as a nutritional supplement. It improves glycemic control and polyneuropathies associated with diabetes mellitus probably by stimulating glucose uptake and improving insulin sensitivity. However, only about 30% of the supplement is absorbed and ALA is rapidly eliminated from the body.
Chromium (Cr) is a trace element essential in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. It is a cofactor for insulin function resulting in enhanced glucose transport into liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Dietary sources of Cr include brewer’s yeast, beer, whole grains, cheese, egg yolks, broccoli, liver, and meat. The refining of grains and sugars and the processing of foods remove most of the absorbable Cr. Cr supplementation, provided as 1000 microgram per day as Cr picolinate, enhanced insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) opined that there is very limited credible evidence for qualified health claims that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
Ampalaya (Momordica charantia) is a popular folk remedy for diabetes in the Philippines and in other Asian countries. Not all preparations in the market containing ampalaya have data showing glucose lowering effect. The most promising is the “Makiling variety” ampalaya leaf tablet developed by the National Integrated Research Program on Medicinal Plants (NIRPROMP), under the leadership of Dr. Nelia Maramba, and the sponsorship of the Philippine Center for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). To our knowledge, this preparation is the most extensively studied to date and its application to be a prescription drug is still under evaluation by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was shown in a clinical trial that the ampalaya leaf tablet taken at 100 mg/kg/day have similar glycemic control to glibenclamide 5 mg/day (unpublished data). Because of its abortifacient property, ampalaya preparations in general are not recommended for pregnant women.
Data regarding cinnamon (cinnamomum cassia) is inconclusive. Some studies showed improvement in fasting and/or postprandial blood glucose and another one showed improvement in HbA1c. The decrease in plasma glucose seem to be more beneficial for those with poorer glycemic control. A meta-analysis, however, concluded that cinnamon does not appear to improve HbA1c, FBG, or lipid parameters in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, different doses have been used in various studies, making results comparisons challenging at best.
Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is a common condiment in Indian cooking and is used as medicine for diabetes in India and China. Mechanisms proposed include decreased carbohydrate absorption and increased insulin secretion. While there are studies that show improved glycemic control with fenugreek, these studies are of lower quality and more studies are needed.
Nopal (Opuntia streptacantha) or the prickly pear cactus, found in arid regions throughout the Western hemisphere, is commonly used for glucose control by those of Mexican descent. It has a high soluble fiber and pectin content, which may affect intestinal glucose uptake, partially accounting for its hypoglycemic actions.” Human studies published in English report decreases in serum glucosela and serum insulin, suggesting an improvement in insulin sensitivity. All articles on Nopal came from the same group of investigators. While the studies on nopal’s hypoglycemic effect are promising, the sample sizes are small and we do not know how many subjects the different publications have in common.
Magnesium is another mineral that we need. The mechanism is most likely improved insulin sensitivity. Dietary sources include whole grains, beans, nuts, and green, leafy vegetables. Magne sium deficiency is associated with poor glucose control in patients with diabetes. However, supplementation of magnesium did not produce clear long-term benefits in type 2 diabetes.
Gymnema sylvestre (Gurmara) has been used in Ayurveda to regulate sugar metabolism for several centuries. Gymnemic acid molecules are similar to that of glucose molecules molecules and may curb the sugar craving. It has been postulated to increase insulin production, regenerate pancreatic cells, increase utilization of glucose, and causes inhibition of glucose absorption from intestine. American ginseng (P. quiquefolius) has been studied for a possible hypoglycemic effect. However, the trials are small and longer term studies are needed.
Liu et al (2004) systematically reviewed traditional Chinese herbal medicines and found that while some Traditional Chinese herbal medicines were shown to be beneficial in both placebo and actively controlled clinical trials, there were limitations in the conduct of these trials.
In summary, alpha-lipoic acid, chromium and the “Makiling variety” ampalaya leaf tablet offer the most promise in terms of adjunctive treatment of diabetes mellitus. The other supplements discussed may benefit from more studies.

The role of herbs in shedding calories and reducing BG levels for Diabetics is acclaimed world over. I resorted to NATVIA’s products which derives its ingredients from fresh tips of Setvia plant.It has 95% less calories than sugar. Its without any Aspartame or Saccharine.

Introduction
This fact sheet provides basic information about cinnamon—common names, what the science says, potential side effects and cautions, and resources for more information.
Common Names—cinnamon, cinnamon bark, Ceylon cinnamon, cassia cinnamon, Chinese cinnamon
Latin Names—Cinnamomum zeylanicum (also known as Cinnamomum verum); Cinnamomum cassia (also known as Cinnamomum aromaticum)
Cinnamon comes from the bark of trees native to China, India, and Southeast Asia. A popular cooking spice in many cultures for centuries, cinnamon also has a long history of use as a folk or traditional medicine. For example, many ancient societies used cinnamon for bronchitis. Additional folk or traditional uses include gastrointestinal problems, loss of appetite, and control of diabetes, as well as a variety of other conditions.
Cinnamon bark is used to make powders, capsules, teas, and liquid extracts. Although there are many kinds of cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon (sometimes referred to as “true” cinnamon) and cassia cinnamon (also known as Chinese cinnamon) are the most familiar.
Top
What the Science Says
High-quality clinical evidence (i.e., studies in people) to support the use of cinnamon for any medical condition is generally lacking.
An analysis of five clinical trials concluded that cinnamon does not appear to affect factors related to diabetes and heart disease.
Side Effects and Cautions
Cinnamon appears to be safe for most people when taken by mouth in amounts up to 6 grams daily for 6 weeks or less. Some people may have allergic reactions to cinnamon or its parts.
Cassia cinnamon contains coumarin, the parent compound of warfarin, a medication used to keep blood from clotting. Due to concerns about the possible effects of coumarin, in 2006, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment warned against consuming large amounts of cassia cinnamon.
Cinnamon should not be used in place of conventional medical care or to delay seeking care if you are experiencing symptoms that are of concern; this is particularly true if you have diabetes.
Tell all your health care providers about any complementary and alternative approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. For tips about talking with your health care providers about complementary and alternative medicineA group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine., see NCCAM’s Time to Talk campaign.

Diabetes is not JUST
diabetes. It is being overweight, having heart
trouble, ageing too quickly - cancer loves sugar -
imbalanced blood sugar is one of the main reasons
for general ill health, and knowing our blood
sugar levels means we can sensibly address the
problem before it becomes serious.
Diabetes is a major problem in
America, affecting an estimated 10 million people,
and is increasing worldwide. There are two types
of diabetes, one in which the pancreas has ceased
production of insulin altogether (and in fact, the
cells that produce it are often found to be
destroyed), and the other in which the cells of
the body have become insulin resistant - as
explained in my article on
Insulin
Resistance, this
means that blood sugar cannot be conveyed into the
cells, with a consequent rise in both blood sugar
and insulin levels.
This latter form of diabetes is
the more common, and is almost always connected
with obesity, more than 80% of those affected
being overweight. Nutritionists now believe that
obesity is the common factor in the increase
of many chronic diseases in the United
States, despite the extraordinary fact that there
are the number of overweight people is increasing
at the same time a Health Club a day opens, and
people are eliminating fat from their diets with
almost religious fervor.
Blood
sugar problems begin with
carbohydrate-driven ""insulin
resistance"", a reaction in the body
which prevents insulin from docking with
its receptor sites in our cells.
Insulin is a hormone, a
messenger in our body, and it is released by the
pancreas to help cope with high levels of sugar in
the blood. Its role is to stimulate the cells to
capture sugar from the blood, and either burn it
for energy as needed then and there, or produce a
storage forms of carbohydrate called glycogen.
When the cells are blocked from accepting insulin,
it is left free in the blood where it cannot
perform its function of lowering blood sugar
levels, and the pancreas is therefore stimulated
to produce more insulin. This leads to a condition
called Hyperinsulemia, which in turn can
lead to diabetes and heart disease.
Where previously alarms were
triggered only when blood sugar levels rose over
125, now new research suggests that patients
with high levels of blood sugar in the
non-diabetic range face a substantial risk of
coronary heart disease and any level over 100
should be addressed.
The
problem at its most basic is that the
sugar not removed from the blood
has to have an end goal,
and that is either to be stored
as fat, or to be made into triglycerides: and as
we all know, obesity and high triglycerides
present us with many undesirable bills, which
eventually have to be paid.
A huge 2004 study of
over 39,000 in 40 countries people made an
incontrovertible connection between high blood
sugar and cardiovascular disease. About
half of the subjects were men, averaging 63
years of age, and the researchers determined
that only one man in three had normal glucose
and insulin levels. I in 5 had diabetes
that had gone undetected, and over 1 in 4 had
pre-diabetic readings. This emphasizes the
importance of controlling blood sugar.
As insulin levels rise and
insulin resistance in the body increases. the
situation develops its own momentum: the
activity of the delta desaturase enzymes which
break down essential fatty acids declines,
increased amounts of saturated fats become part of
our cell membranes, and insulin sensitivity
decreases again. The enzyme pathways shut down
through which Arachidonic acid is converted
to the friendly GLA. This in turn means the
messengers (eicosanoids) which promote insulin
sensitivity in the cells are not sent to do their
jobs, more insulin is produced to take care of the
added carbs, and a vicious cycle leading
potentially to diabetes and cardiovascular
problems (Syndrome X, or Insulin Resistance) is
set in motion.
An important ratio for total
health is the amount of lean muscle compared to
the amount of body fat: the higher your ratio of
lean tissue versus fat, the lower your risk for
diabetes. (See RESOURCES)
Will the
obsessive use of sunscreens lead to
even MORE diabetes??
The link between
vitamin D3 and diabetes has been known for quite a
while, though the mechanism is not yet explained.
It makes me wonder whether the new phobia about
sun exposure may in the long run have unexpected
consequences, particularly for our children who
would normally be out romping in the vitamin D
rich sunshine all summer..

Don't overlook the
fact that diabetics are at greater risk for
osteoporosis: to quote information provided by Dr.
Steven Schneider in answer to a question in
Medscape, ""it is clear that there is an
increased risk for low bone mineral density and
particularly for bone fractures in patients with
type 1 and, to a lesser extent, type 2 diabetes
mellitus. These abnormalities may be related at
least in part to prolonged periods of poor
metabolic control and might be decreased by more
aggressive treatment regimens.......Certainly
women with diabetes need to pay special attention
to the prevention of osteoporosis by maintaining
an adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. This
will often require calcium supplementation, which
may need to be started at an early age while peak
bone mass is still developing.""
What he is saying
is that all diabetics are at risk, but children
who have type 1 diabetes are particularly likely
to suffer because of the effects on bone
building during the crucial developmental years.
If your child is a type 1 diabetic,
make sure that adequate calcium and Vitamin D
are provided.
Onions
and garlic have qualities which make them
extra helpful for diabetics
Onion and garlic have
significant blood sugar lowering action, because
their double sulfur (Thiole) bonds bind to enzymes
which deactivate insulin, allowing it to be active
longer. The oils have active effects, but
flavonoids such as Quercetin in onions may also
come in to play, and the principal active
ingredients are allyl propyl disulphides (APDS),
and diallyl disulphide oxed
(Allicin) which appear to compete with
insulin for docking sites in the liver, thus
making more free insulin available in the blood
stream and lowering glucose levels
Onion extract has been
found to reduce blood sugar levels during oral and
intravenous glucose tolerance. The effect improved
as the dosage was increased; however, beneficial
effects were observed even for low levels that
used in the diet (eg., 25 to 200 grams). The
effects were similar in both raw and boiled onion
extracts. Onions also affect the hepatic
metabolism of glucose and/or increases the release
of insulin, and/or prevent insulin's destruction.
In supplement form, studies have shown that the
garlic needs to be standardized for its allicin
content, when 800mg per day can significantly
lower fasting blood glucose levels.
Sufferers
from diabetic neuropathy need to know
about
Alpha
Lipoic Acid
and Acetyl-L-Carnitine
Alpha Lipoic Acid (also known as
Thioctic Acid, another thiol), has been used for
some years now in Europe for this condition.
Dr. Murray says that ALA ""help
diabetics by facilitating better conversion of
sugar into energy...Its ability to improve blood
sugar metabolism is a result of its effects on
glucose metabolism and an ability to increase
insulin sensitivity. Diabetics taking insulin or
blood sugar lowering drugs are cautioned that
lipoic acid supplementation can result in changes
in dosage requirements. Close monitoring of blood
sugar levels is required."" Doses are in
the 500 to 600 mg range, and less may not be
effective.
The January 2005 edition of
Diabetes Care, ( vol 28: pp 96-101.) carries
a study by Dr. Sima which evaluated two studies
involving over 1200 patients with diabetic
neuropathy. Analysis indicated significant
improvement, both at the 6 month and 1 year mark
using 1000 mgs of Acetyl-L-Carnitine.
People who had been diagnosed
with diabetes for the shortest length of time not
only experienced the highest level of pain relief,
but also showed improvement in nerve
structure and reactions.
The researchers said the results
suggested that optimal results may be obtained by
starting this therapy as early as possible in the
course of the disease.
Stress
and inflammation also play a role
in the onset of Diabetes:
researchers from the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases state that chronic
activation of the immune system, with upregulation
of interleukin-6, may play a role in the
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Cortisol or sex
hormones or both could also be contributing
factors, the investigators add.
Jack Challem, the Nutrition Reporter, traces an
interesting route for a stress/diabetes connection
in his 2007 book, the
Food-Mood Solution (http://www.foodmoodsolution.com/). He points out that
not only does the increased stress of our
lifestyles cause cortisol to be imbalanced, but
also that the changes in our personalities caused
by unrelenting stress lead to less time for, and
less interest in, nutritious cooking and wise
dietary choices.
Paleolithic
Diet and Diabetes Control
I read a fascinating article in
issue 49, 2000 of the Herbalgram (you can
find it at herbalgram.org) which detailed a quest
initially undertaken by 20 Native Americans
of the Seri and O'odham tribes, but eventually
swelling to number 120 ""Desert Pilgrims""
These tribes finally tired of
the probing research undertaken by the National
Institute of Health into the high incidence of
Diabetes in Native Americans, and decided to
organize a trek through their ancestral region,
eating nothing but indigenous foods and living off
the land. They were full of trepidation at
the start of the trek, not sure they could make it
through the 12 day, 240 mile journey.
Along the way, they ate
only prickly pear and other cactus, wild
greens, wild game supplied both by villages they
passed through and the efforts of their own
hunters, beans, mescal, chia seeds and chilies.
They drank only water and teas made from creosote
bush, damiana and desert lavender (among other
herbs).
At the end of the walk, there
were reports of dramatically reduced blood glucose
levels as well as improvement in cholesterol
levels. This is living proof of the wisdom
of the Paleolithic diet - which can be simply
summed up as ""if it didn't exist 100 years
ago, don't eat it."" I would add
""if it doesn't rot with time, don't eat
it""!
Of course, in Paleolithic times there were
going to be days when nothing at all was on the
menu - enforced, fasting, as you might say.
This ties in with interesting
research
(http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/88030.php) which suggests that fasting one day a
month positively affects cardiovascular health,
possibly through reduced exposure to glucose.
Researchers theorize that this one day without
food gives the organs time to rest and work more
efficiently.
There
are two effective dietary approaches that
people who
have this problem can take:
one is the 40-30-30 diet, where
care is taken every day that the food you eat is
always composed of 40% complex carbohydrates,
30% protein and 30% fat, with between 50 and 100
grams of fiber daily.
The other is to make sure that
you are drinking at least 8 glasses of pure water
every day, and that your sodium intake is
adequate.
The balance of nutrients I
recommend above has a very low glycemic index,
which means that their entry rate into the blood
stream is slow: this in turn means that the body
has time to control the situation, the pancreas is
not over-stimulated to produce insulin, and the
mechanism that stores fat in the body is not put
on high alert. What about the water and salt?
A very interesting book I have
been reading by Dr. Batmanghelidj called Your
Body's Many Cries for Water suggests
persuasively that lack of water and sodium in
the cells of the body activates the brain to
raise its glucose requirements, and by a
complicated process involving Tryptophan,
Histamine and Prostaglandin E, also to inhibit
insulin production.
He states that a low salt diet
is actually counterproductive for diabetics. In
another part of his fascinating book, he
documents many successes with weight loss,
simply by increasing the amount of water his
patients drink daily, and replacing all other
fluids (i.e. pops, especially diet, juices,
coffee & teas) with it.
Supplements can also help: a
British study (Diabetes
Care 2002;25:1709-1714.)
has shown that even
short-term use of dietary phytoestrogens significantly
and positively affects
fasting insulin levels, insulin resistance, HbA1c
levels, total cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol,
cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, and free
thyroxine (thyroid function) levels. The
investigators concluded that even short term
supplementation with soy phytoestrogens
( though it was not clear whether the soy protein
itself, or its component isoflavones are
responsible for the effect) reduces insulin
resistance and improves glycemic control in type 2
postmenopausal diabetics.
If
you are using supplements, be sure to
choose ones
that contain no extra iron.
A study in the Journal of the
American Medical Association showed the risk of
diabetes for women whose iron levels are too high
increased significantly. You can access the study
in
RESOURCES.
As long ago as 1982 the American
journal of Clinical Nutrition reported a
correlation between serum chromium and serum
insulin levels, and recent research has
corroborated that, together with vanadium, it is
effective in controlling blood sugar levels.
A 1997 study by Anderson, in Diabetes,
46:1786-91, which was randomized and
placebo-controlled showed that both fasting and
post-prandial sugar and insulin levels were
reduced significantly using chromium. The study
got better results using a dosage of 1000 mcg. per
day, where previously only 200 mcg have been
routinely recommended by nutritionists.
Insulin dependant diabetics
should use chromium with caution, since its very
effectiveness can be dangerous for them.Perhaps
the most widely used form of chromium is Chromium
Picolinate, and in view of some of the rumors that
have been spread about this supplement, almost
always encouraged if not outright started by
companies making rival forms, I want to take this
opportunity of saying that both the USDA and the
manufacturers have undertaken toxicity studies
that meet every standard of such studies, and have
never come up with any adverse results. (HPB June
99;8)
A 2001 study suggests that
treatment with L-Arginine over a long period (1
month in the study) can improves insulin
sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes.
The authors of the study point out that L-Arginine,
which increases nitric oxide (NO) levels, is known
to stimulate insulin secretion. In this
study, patients treated with 3 grams of the amino
acid daily showed reductions in systolic blood
pressure compared with placebo-treated patients,
together with significantly increased
forearm blood flow and normal levels of cyclic
guanosine monophosphate, a second messenger of NO.
More to the point, patients who
received L-Arginine had a significant ( 34%)
increase in glucose disposal and significant
improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity, as
endogenous glucose production decreased
significantly although glucose production in both
the L-Arginine group and the placebo group
remained significantly higher than in 10 normal
subjects.
""Our study has shown for the first time that
an increment in NO availability induced by the
administration of L-arginine is able to increase
insulin sensitivity, even if complete
normalization is not achieved,"" the authors
conclude.
Diabetes Care
2001;24:875-880.
An
interesting new compound which may offer
help in fightitng
diabetes is Co-enzyme-A, to which
Pantethine
is a pre-cursor:
this substance helps maintain
healthy RNA/DNA, deterioration of which can lead
to many age-related disorders, to include
diabetes.
The USDA was considering
applying for a use patent on Cinnamon Extract for
diabetes, based on their studies showing
beneficial effects on blood lipids as well as a
significant 20% improvement in blood sugar levels.
Read the study here
(http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2004/040419.htm). I hope this doesn't mean that certain fast
food chains will now begin promoting their
cinnamon rolls as nutritional supplements BUT the
substantial evidence for the helpfulness of
cinnamon in blood sugar control can no longer be
ignored.
Another supplement that seems to
help particularly with the problem of insulin
resistance is Garcinia Cambogia. It comes
from India, where it has been traditionally used
as an appetite control, and as an aid in
processing food. It is a source of hydroxy-citric
acid, or HCA, which appears to work by blocking a
key cellular pathway that converts glucose to fat.
Certainly animals fed an HCA supplemented diet
have shown reduced food intake, a decline in body
fat and lowered triglyceride levels.
Traditional Ayurvedic medicine
has successfully applied a herbal approach to
diabetes: a herb called Gymnema
Sylvestre (also recommended by Dr.
Whitaker) which appears to assist the pancreas in
manufacturing insulin, and in studies has been
shown to be successful in helping control both
type 1 and 11 diabetes - in fact, it is
recommended by Natural Health professionals that
you monitor your medication carefully, since this
herb can lower requirements for it.. studies have
been done using a specific Gymnema extract called
GS4, and the results are encouraging. Using
200 mg/day cutspatients' required insulin dose in
half...
Bitter Melon
also helps regulate blood sugar, even for pets,
and research is being done on the herb Fenugreek
for its part in controlling blood sugars. Dr.
Leigh Broadmoor (News from the Herbal Village,
Vol. 1V, Issue 1: 11) points out that fenugreek is
about 50% fiber, with 20% being mucilage and
mucilage makes a significant difference to blood
sugar levels. She cites a study done by the Indian
National Institute of Nutrition where 10 IDDM
patients were given 100 grams of debittered
fenugreek seed powder per day, which led to a 30%
decrease in fasting glucose and an improvement in
glucose tolerance. The amount of sugar excreted in
the urine dropped by 54% without a concomitant
increase in blood sugar levels. She says this
result cannot be explained entirely by the
mucilage, and fenugreek also contains many plant
phytochemicals which may be part of the effect. Be
careful of Fenugreek if you have allergies to
other foods n the same family, such as soy or
peanuts!
A
new entry is an extract of a herb called
Lagerstroemia Speciosa,
which helps transport glucose
and therefore balance blood sugar, evening out the
highs and the lows. Companies are now coming out
with combinations of the herbs and nutrients
helpful for insulin control, and three I recommend
are Glucoreg by Solaray, Glucocare by Ayurvedic
Concepts, and Glucotrim by Nature's Plus. My own
formulation, Glucose Support, contains many of
these helpful nutrients.
Jarrow Formulas makes a protein
mix called Glycemic Balance, which has been used
very successfully by many of my clients attempting
to control sugar variations, and a formula called
Glucose Optimizer, which in effect contains nearly
everything I have mentioned to regulate blood
sugar. Another herb which helps balance blood
sugar is American Ginseng, which has been shown to
lower blood sugar levels even in non-diabetics. (Arch.Intern.Med.,
Apr. 10 2000; 160(7):1009-13)
An interesting and little known fact is that the
end products of sugar metabolism in the body are
actually used as markers for aging.
They are called AGEs, appropriately enough, which
stands for Advanced Glycation End Products. The
more of them you have, the older your biological
age. Controlling your blood sugar,
therefore, can actually address your life span.
Some studies suggest American Ginseng can lower
the AGE levels. So, if you want to live longer,
limit your carbohydrate intake, choose any
carbohydrates you eat from those containing sugars
which enter the blood slowly, usually because they
are accompanied by protein, fiber or fatty acids,
and select supplements which will help you balance
your sugars. See RESOURCES
for more about Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load.
Consider
the financial costs of Diabetes, as
estimated by the American
Diabetes Association: http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/26/3/917
Direct medical and indirect expenditures
attributable to diabetes in
2002 were estimated at $132 billion.
Direct medical expenditures
alone totaled $91.8 billion and
comprised $23.2 billion for
diabetes care, $24.6 billion for chronic
complications attributable to
diabetes, and $44.1 billion for excess
prevalence of general medical
conditions. Inpatient days (43.9%),
nursing home care (15.1%),
and office visits (10.9%) constituted
the major expenditure groups
by service settings. In addition, 51.8%
of direct medical expenditures
were incurred by people >65 years
old. Attributable indirect expenditures
resulting from lost workdays,
restricted activity days, mortality, and
permanent disability due to
diabetes totaled $39.8 billion. U.S.
health expenditures for the
health care components included in the
study totaled $865 billion, of
which $160 billion was incurred by
people with diabetes. Per capita medical
expenditures totaled $13,243
for people with diabetes and $2,560 for
people without diabetes. When
adjusting for differences in age, sex,
and race/ethnicity between
the population with and without
diabetes, people with diabetes
had medical expenditures that were 2.4
times higher than
expenditures that would be incurred by
the same group in the absence
of diabetes.
Smokers Beware!
Cigarette smoking
is now further implicated as a culprit of
impaired glucose tolerance. According to
findings published recently in the Annals of
Internal Medicine , risk of impaired fasting
glucose and type 2 diabetes increases in a
dose-dependent manner with the number of
cigarettes smoked per day and the number of
pack-years of exposure. Nakanishi et al (Ann
Intern Med. 2000;133:183-191.)perceive the
findings as evidence that smoking is a
""modifiable risk factor that can be
targeted"" for diabetes prevention.
The risks for developing type 2 diabetes were
imposing. In comparison with never-smokers, the
relative risk was 1.08 for ever-smokers, 1.88
for the one-to-20-cigarette group, 3.02 for the
21-to-30-cigarette group, and 4.09 for heavier
smokers -- constituting a statistically
significant trend across current-smoker
categories. The longer the habit has
existed, the greater the increase of risk.
""The mechanism of how cigarette smoking
increases the risk for impaired fasting glucose
and type 2 diabetes remains to be
elucidated,"" write Nakanishi and
colleagues. They cite recent study findings
suggesting that smoking causes insulin
resistance in peripheral tissues, increased
serum insulin and C-peptide levels, and the
release of counterregulatory hormones.
Of course,
they might also consider the fact that most
cigarettes contain sugar.
Then, consider also the health
costs:
People with a fasting blood sugar level of
100-125 mg/dl had an adjusted nearly 300%
increase in their risk for coronary heart
disease than people with a level below 79 mg/dl.
This information was compiled from a
cross-sectional study of nearly 2500 people.
In fact, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation now
uses a fasting blood sugar of 90 mg/dl or higher
as a biomarker of coronary heart disease risk.
The Cleveland Clinic gets very concerned when
they encounter someone with a fasting blood
sugar above 90 mg/dl. They try to intervene with
exercise, diet and weight control.
(American
Journal Cardiology March 2002(1);89(5):596-9)
Additionally, in the June 22nd
2002 edition of Lancet, a Swedish study at the
Karolinska Institute was published which
researched patients admitted for acute
myocardial infarctions: these patients had not
previously had any reason to suspect that they
suffered from any blood sugar imbalances:
the researchers recorded blood sugar levels at
admission, during the stay in the hospital,
at the time of discharge, and 3 months
later. At hospital discharge, 58 of 164
patients (35%) had impaired glucose tolerance,
and 51 patients (31%) had undiagnosed diabetes,
the researchers found. At 3 months, 58 of 144
(40%) patients had impaired glucose and 36
patients (25%) were diabetic.
Diabetes is a very serious
health condition, and I do not to suggest that you
make changes without your Doctor's consent; for
many people, however, nutrition makes the
difference between medication & control.

Preventing and Reversing Diabetes
Username
Password
The worldwide incidence of diabetes is out of control. Every 5 minutes in Britain someone is diagnosed with diabetes. By 2010 approximately 3 million people in Britain will have diabetes. It’s the same the world over – India, Africa, China, America, and Australia. If you are of Asian or African origin the risk is even higher. The older you are, and the more overweight you are, the higher the risk. In Britain one in seven people over 40 develop diabetes. Our drug bill for diabetes is close to £1 billion a year and rising.
The scandal is, we already know the solution and it’s not drugs – it’s a low GL diet, plus exercise and certain supplements. Eating a low GL diet doesn’t just prevent diabetes, it reverses it.
What is Diabetes?
Basically, diabetes is what happens when you have too much sugar in your blood. This happens both because a person eats too much sugar or high GL foods, and because their insulin isn’t working properly. As soon as your blood sugar goes too high the body pumps insulin into the bloodstream which gets the excess out as fast as possible, converting much of it into fat.
If you don’t make enough insulin, or you are ‘insulin resistant’ your blood sugar (glucose) level stays too high. This is bad news because glucose is highly toxic in large amounts, damaging arteries, brain cells, kidneys and the eyes. Glucose also feeds infections, chronic inflammation and promotes the formation of blood clots; some 80 per cent of people with diabetes die from cardiovascular disease. Every year, a thousand people with diabetes start kidney dialysis, while others go blind. Half of all diabetics have one or more of these complications. Much of this damage happens because sugar sticks to, and damages protein, producing what are called ‘advanced glycation end-products’, nicknamed AGEs – and that’s what they do – age you rapidly.
Two Kinds of Diabetes
There are two kinds of diabetes: insulin-dependent diabetes (Type 1) and non-insulin dependent diabetes (Type 2). Type 1 diabetes is very rare. It usually develops in children whose immune systems mistakenly attack cells in the pancreas that make insulin. It’s called an ‘auto-immune’ disease and is linked with food allergy, especially to dairy products introduced in early infancy. Without insulin you can’t control blood sugar. These people therefore need to inject insulin. The next best thing is following my low GL diet, plus certain supplements, because this decreases the need for insulin. Type 1 diabetes is not, however, completely reversible.
By far the most common type of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes. This is a direct consequence of diet and lifestyle, the single greatest being weight gain. Being obese increases diabetes risk 77 times.
Diagnosing Diabetes
The diagnosis of diabetes is based on testing your blood sugar level in one of three ways. Firstly, if your ‘fasting’ blood glucose level is too high (above 7.8 mmol/l) that means your insulin isn’t working. Secondly, if you eat something sweet – the equivalent of the sugar in a can of fizzy drink – and 2 hours later your blood glucose is above 11 mmol/l then you’re diagnosed with diabetes. A more sensitive is a measure of your ‘long-term’ blood sugar levels. Every time your blood sugar levels goes too high, creating blood sugar ‘spikes’, your red blood cells get a little more sugar coated. This is measured as Glycosylated Haemoglobin, meaning sugar-coated red blood cells. This is also called HbA1c and is an example of an AGE – a messed up molecule that can cause immense damage. If your blood level is above 7% you need to be screened for diabetes. Ideally, your doctor should also test your insulin level to get a full picture of your blood sugar control.
You want your ‘fasting’ blood sugar level to be below 6, your ‘after a meal’ blood sugar level to be below 7 and your Glycosylated Haemoglobin to be as low as possible, and certainly below 6.3%.(1) The healthiest people have a Glycosylated Haemoglobin of between 4% and 5%.
A Tale of Two Diabetics
To make all this real let’s take the case of a recently diagnosed diabetic on standard diabetic medication, and a long-term diabetic, injecting insulin.
Kyra, aged 37, was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2007. Kyra’s fasting glucose level was 11 (should be below 6), and a glycosylated haemoglobin level of 7.8 (should be below 6.3). She was overweight, weighing in at 18 stone (252 pounds). She was prescribed the drug Metformin 500mg, twice a day, by her GP who told her she would remain on the drug for the rest of her life. Metformin improves your sensitivity to insulin and helped lower her blood sugar to an average of 7.
She was referred to a dietician who recommended a low fat, low sugar, low calorie diet, limiting fruit to no more than 5 portions of fruit per day. The dietician told her to stop eating pumpkin seeds because they are ‘high in fat’ and to drink diet cola instead of cola. (In animal studies pumpkin extracts help to stabilise insulin levels.)(2) She followed the conventional low fat, low calorie diet, cutting down her sugar intake, and started walking every day.
She came to see me in April and had done well, losing one stone in under three months. But she still suffered from low energy, dizziness, mood swings and digestive complaints and had too high blood sugar levels. She went on my low GL diet, and started supplementing chromium 600mcg together with a cinnamon extract called Cinnulin, vitamin C and a high-potency multivitamin. Within days her blood sugar was normal and, three weeks later she didn’t need medication. Six weeks after starting my low GL diet her blood sugar level was normal (averaging 5.5), and glycosylated haemoglobin was normal (6.2%), without medication, and she had lost another stone (14 lbs) in weight. Kyra was delighted. “My doctor told me I’d be on medication for the rest of my life. I am really thrilled to have been able to come off medication and still have a stable blood sugar. My energy is much better. My skin is clearer, mood more stable and I’ve lost 14lbs. I feel in control of food instead of it being in control of me.” One year later she’s lost another 14 pounds, three stone in all since her diagnosis. Her glycosylated haemoglobin is 5.2%, which is perfect, and blood glucose now averages 5. She still has no sugar cravings, good energy and mood. She’s cut back on the chromium and now takes 200mcg. Her doctor is delighted.
But what if you’ve suffered from diabetes for years, and need insulin to control it? Can a low GL diet still reverse it? A nurse in Norway is a case in point.
She started gaining weight in her 30s. She followed official nutritional recommendations and did not overeat but, year on year, continued to gain weight. In 1992, at the age of 61, she was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes, hypertension and low thyroid, and weighed 120 kg, close to 19 stone. Her blood sugar was out of control and her glycosylated haemoglobin was 8.9%. She was treated with a cocktail of drugs and ended up injecting 150 units of insulin a day. But, despite all this, her weight continued to increase so she decided she had to do something different. She sought the advice of diabetes expert Dr Fedon Lindberg in Norway, who put her on a strict low GL diet and exercise regime. To cut a long story short today, she needs no insulin, takes no medication, has a normal blood sugar and glycosylated haemoglobin and her weight has stabilized below 80 kgs (12 and a half stone). Her story was recently published in the Norwegian Journal of Medicine.(3)
The Dangers of Insulin
Having too much insulin actually promotes weight gain because its job is to store excess sugar in the blood as fat. The antidote is a low GL diet. The higher your insulin the more effective a low-GL diet is.(4) By following my low-GL diet your blood sugar level is naturally more even, so your body doesn’t have to produce so much insulin.
There’s another problem with making, or injecting too much insulin - it increases cholesterol production in the liver, it constricts blood vessels making your blood pressure go up and stimulates the release of dangerous fats called triglycerides. So it’s bad news for heart disease. Eating a low-GL diet lowers both insulin levels and cholesterol in diabetics.(5)
Some diabetes drugs, called sulfonylureas (brands include Amaryl, Euglucon and Diamicron), are designed to stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to produce more insulin. Most type 2 diabetics produce too much insulin already – the problem is that the insulin that’s produced just does not function properly.
These drugs also increase the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, according to a five-year study of 5,500 diabetics, published in 2006 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The higher the drug dose and the more consistently the patients took the drugs, the greater the risk of cardiovascular death.(6) The same is true with a newer class of drug called glitazones. In fact, a major government funded study in the US, testing the effects of aggressive drug strategies to lower blood sugar levels in more than 10,000 diabetics had to be abandoned due to much higher cardiovascular deaths.(7) A recent issue of the British Medical Journal stated that ‘taking prescription drugs (glitazones) to prevent diabetes cannot be justified’(8), favouring a diet and lifestyle approach. When you get your diet right, these drugs often become unnecessary.
Low-GL Diet
Instead of trying to cheat the system by stimulating more insulin release, the solution for both weight gain, diabetes and heart disease, is to eat a low-GL diet that means you need to make less insulin to keep your blood sugar level stable, and to naturally improve your sensitivity to insulin so you need less insulin to get the job done (more on how to do this in a minute). Hundreds of studies now prove that a low-GL diet helps to improve blood sugar balance, and makes you less insulin-resistant, and hence reduces the need for medication. These are well summarised in a review article in the Journal of the American Medical Association for those who want the science.(9)
Exercise Plays a Key Role
Exercise is also a vital piece of the prevention equation. A review of fourteen good quality trials found that, while exercise alone didn’t decrease weight, it did lower glycosylated haemoglobin by the kind of amount one might expect from a drug.(10) As your energy goes up on my low-GL diet you’ll find that so too does your desire to exercise.
Low Fat Diets Don’t Work as Well as Low GL Diets for Diabetes
According to diabetes expert Professor Charles Clark, author of the Diabetes Revolution (Vermillion) “There is a simple cure for the obesity and diabetes epidemic but everyone is looking in the wrong place. We blame overeating or fat consumption, but the real villain in both diabetes and obesity is the large amount of refined carbohydrates we eat. It’s this that pushes up our blood sugar levels and leads to diabetes. Meanwhile our bodies store the extra blood sugar as fat and so we put on weight.”
Not only does this make sense, it’s supported by so much science that it’s time to bury the low-fat, low-calorie diet myth once and for all. For example, two recent prospective studies found that following a low-fat diet didn’t decrease risk for diabetes, but having a high intake of sugar increased risk.(11) Another, from China, involving over 64,000 people, found that the higher the GL of a person’s diet, the higher was their risk of diabetes.(12) In Japan, a similar study found that the higher the GL the higher were markers for diabetes risk, such as glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels.(13) An Australian study reports that eating more vegetables and low-GL foods cuts diabetes risk by a quarter.(14)
Another study of 85,059 women found that low carbohydrate diets are better than low-fat diets in preventing diabetes. The women who ate less carbohydrate and got most of their fat and protein from vegetable sources were at less risk of developing diabetes.(15)
A 2008 study in the New England Journal of Medicine put volunteers onto one of three diets: a conventional low-calorie, low-fat diet; a Mediterranean diet, restricted for calories and high in fibre and monounsaturated fats; and a high-protein, high-fat, low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, but emphasising vegetarian sources of protein rather than meat and dairy products.(16) The low-fat diet was the least effective for weight loss and raised glucose levels. The Mediterranean diet was the most effective for diabetes, significantly lowered glucose levels in diabetics.
My low GL diet is the best of all worlds, because it gives you a simple way to control the total GL of your diet, by limiting the amount of carbohydrates you eat and making sure you eat the kind of foods that contain slow-releasing carbohydrates, incorporating all the key principles that help you stabilise your blood sugar, lose sugar cravings and increase your energy, with none of the downsides of high animal protein diets.
Chromium Helps Stabilise Your Blood Sugar
Dozens of top quality studies now confirm that supplementing 400mcg to 600mcg of chromium a day, which is more than ten times the average intake in the British diet, helps stabilize blood sugar. In some trial participants this non-toxic mineral has normalised blood sugar completely. Chromium works by improving your sensitivity to insulin.
A 2007 review of over 40 randomised controlled trials found that giving Type-2 diabetics chromium improves their fasting blood sugar levels and also decreases glycosylated haemoglobin levels. The study, published in Diabetes Care, found that the best effects were seen with chromium in doses of 400-1000mcg per day.(17) For example, a landmark study in 1997, looked at 120 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes - 60 were given 200ug chromium per day and the other 60 were given 1000ug/day. After just 2 months, significant improvements were seen in glucose control, in both groups. After 4 months, there was almost a 30% reduction in glucose levels in the higher dosage group.(18) In another over 800 diabetics who were taking insulin or anti-hyperglycemic drugs were given 500mcg chromium per day for 9 months. (19) After just 1 month, fasting and post-meal glucose levels had significantly fallen. At the end of the 9 months, 90% of patients reported a decrease in fatigue, thirst and the need for frequent urination which are classic symptoms of diabetes. In fact chromium has been shown to dramatically decrease the need for medication in many diabetics and in some cases eliminate the need for drugs completely(20).
Despite being about ten times higher than you’ll get from a so-called well balanced diet there are no known adverse effects of supplementation below 10,000mcg a day, according the UK’s Committee on Toxicity.(21) Most available chromium supplements are 200mcg, but in relation to diabetes, a daily intake of 400 to 600mcg is most likely to be effective. I’ve not found it necessary to have more than this. I recommend taking chromium picolinate, or chromium polynicotinate (chromium polynicotinate contains vitamin B3 which is works in synergy with chromium).
High Vitamin C More Than Halves Diabetes Risk
Another important vitamin for diabetics is vitamin C. Having a high level of vitamin C in your blood, consistent with that achieved by supplementation and eating a high fruit and vegetable diet, reduces your risk of diabetes by 62%. That’s the conclusion of a study of over 21,000 people over a twelve year period, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine.(22) Those in the top fifth of plasma vitamin C were 62% less likely to develop diabetes, compared to those in the bottom fifth. The optimal blood level for diabetes reduction is achieved by supplementing 1,000mg a day and eating lots of fruit and vegetables.
One study in India gave diabetics either 500mg or 1,000mg of vitamin C. Only those taking 1,000mg of vitamin C a day had a significant decrease in both their blood sugar levels, and glycosylated haemoglobin.(23)
A Spoonful of Cinnamon
Cinnamon has been used for many years in traditional herbal medicine for treatment of type-2 diabetes. The active ingredient in cinnamon, MCHP, mimics the action of the hormone insulin, which removes excess sugar from the bloodstream.
Animal studies have found that there is a positive effect on blood sugar levels when treated with cinnamon. There have also been positive findings in human studies. For example, a research group found that when pre-diabetics were given a cinnamon extract called Cinnulin® for 12 weeks, there were improvements in blood sugar levels, as well as body fat percentage.(24) Another study gave diabetics 1, 3 or 6 grams of cinnamon per day.(25) One gram is about half a teaspoon. All responded to the cinnamon within weeks, with blood sugar levels 20 per cent lower on average than those of a control group. Not all studies, however, have shown a positive result.
Based on these results you might want to add half a teaspoon of cinnamon, which is also an excellent antioxidant, to your diet. Alternatively, supplement a cinnamon extract such as Cinnulin® which has a high concentration of MHCP, the active ingredient. In this case 500mg is sufficient.
In summary, whether you have type-1 (insulin-dependent) or type-2 diabetes, by following a low GL diet you minimise your body’s need to produce insulin. This strategy is also perfect for preventing diabetes:
• Follow my low GL diet strictly (see the Holford Low GL Diet or Holford Low GL Diet Made Easy)
• Exercise daily
• Supplement 400 to 600mcg of chromium daily. Cut back to 200mcg when you achieve normal blood sugar levels.
• Supplement 1-2 gram of vitamin C daily
• Have the equivalent of half a teaspoon of cinnamon
Bear in mind that your need for medication may decrease so it is important to monitor your blood sugar levels and inform your primary care practitioner accordingly. If you have Type-2 diabetes there’s a good chance you’ll end up not needing any medication. If you have Type-1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes the same recommendations apply but you’ll still need insulin, although possibly less of it.
I recommend you start the diet first, together with 1 gram of vitamin C, a good multivitamin. Then, three days later add in a supplement of 200mcg of chromium. Then, 3 days later, increase to 400mcg and three days later, increase to 600mcg while monitoring your blood sugar levels.

Can a 16 year old female get diabetes type 2?
I’m not too fat, but not thin, and I like eating. I’m wondering if I can get type 2 diabetes?
Also, if I eat cinnamon frequently will it help avoiding it?
AnswerThe youngest that I have diagnosed someone with type 2 diabetes is age 12 although I have read of one case where the person was aged 10. There is no credible evidence that cinnamon has any effect on blood glucose one way or the other. At this point the utility of cinnamon should be relegated to that of a myth. There is not really any means by which you may avoid diabetes if you are destined to develop it. There are ways that you may delay or mitigate the severity of diabetes if you should acquire it. If I may be of further assistance please let me know. I wish you the very best of health and happiness and in all things may God bless. JR

You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age. However, a healthy diet and regular exercise are ways to prevent or significantly delay the onset. At this time, there is no conclusive proof that cinnamon helps.

Drug Rehab And Detox
What to expect from your drug detox!
Drug detox is a step that needs to be taken for some people,
but its a scary step when you dont know what to expect.
Dont think for a minute though that you are not in good company. There are
legions of people in the world facing the same problems you are with drugs.
Each year in the United States, approximately 8.2 million persons are dependent
on alcohol and 3.5 million are dependent on illicit drugs, including stimulants
(1 million) and heroin (750,000). Lets check out what you'll have to go through
if you finally want to detox and fix up your life.
The goal of drug detox is to rid the body of toxins accumulated by
drug use. The first step to expect during drug detox is drug withdrawal. The
definition of withdrawal is ""Discontinuation of the use of an addictive substance,
and the physiological and mental readjustment that accompanies such discontinuation.""
Once you have discontinued using drugs, physical and behavioral withdrawal
symptoms may follow.
But the detox people know this and have come up with some ways to make your
drug detox go smoother so the withrawal doesnt suck so much.
the pharmacologic treatment of drug withdrawal often involves substituting
a long-acting agent for the abused drug and then gradually tapering its dosage.
The nature and severity of the withdrawal symptoms during drug detox vary
greatly depending on the particular drug or drugs that were being used as
well as the frequency of use. These days there are few people who use one
drug exclusively so it is very common to see individuals in drug detox that
use alcohol and cocaine, or alcohol and prescription medications (dont worry,
every one can be helped).
Alcohol Detox
If alcohol is your demon, alcohol-withdrawal symptoms might be expected to
peak about 72 hours after the last use of alcohol, but medications can reduce
symptoms within hours. In patients with delirium tremens, management with
medication requires high doses of benzodiazepines (e.g., 5 to 10 mg of diazepam
by intravenous injection, repeated in two to four hours if seizures occur).
Unless delirium is present, medication is typically needed for no more than
seven days after the last use of alcohol, although some patients will report
withdrawal symptoms, including sleep problems, for several more weeks. Protracted
symptoms may precipitate relapse.
Heroin Detox
As for heroin, symptoms peak within 36 to 72 hours and last for 7 to 10 days,
whereas for methadone, symptoms peak at 72 to 96 hours but last for 14 days
or more, and for buprenorphine, symptoms are less severe and of shorter duration.
Cocaine and Amphetamine Detox
Severe depressive symptoms may last only 8 to 48 hours, but milder ones typically
persist for approximately two weeks. Although no medications have shown efficacy
in reducing the severity of drug withdrawal symptoms, acute stimulant toxicity
characterized by delusions, paranoid thinking, and stereotyped compulsive
behavior may require neuroleptic agents or benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide
in the first 48 hours after abrupt discontinuation of the drug. Because those
who are dependent on stimulants are often also dependent on alcohol or heroin,
withdrawal symptoms due to the discontinuation of these drugs and other substances
may require concomitant treatment.
Drug Detox- The Process
Drug detox is performed in many different ways depending on where you decide
to receive treatment. Most drug detox centers simply provide treatment to
avoid physical withdrawal to alcohol and other drugs. Ideally, a trained detox
facility will incorporate counseling and therapy during detox to help with
the psychological distress that the individual may experience as well.
I think this is great because most drug addictions are caused by an underlying
emotional strain that caused the addiction in the first place. So its fine
to get the person into detox and get them off the drugs, but if you dont fix
what caused the problem in the first place then its very easy to get back
into your chosen addiction again as soon as the emotional pain resurfaces.
Detoxification should cover all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and
purification from drugs. The removal of drug residuals is a key goal in drug
detox. Without this process, drug residues can remain in ones body and cause
cravings for years after drug use has ceased. A vital step in a successful
drug detox as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated
toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse
effects from the drugs they have taken.
So there you have the first steps of drug detox, they take you in and get
rid of the physical addiction to the drug, clean out the by products of your
chosen drug or drugs and set you up with some counselling to make sure that
all your emotional scars are clean to heal.
Just remember that recovery doesnt end with the detox and is an ongoing process
and each aspect of life that is affected by alcohol and drug use must be addressed.
I'm truly proud of you for making it this far. Drug abuse is a huge weight
on your shoulders and I would love for you to shake the monkey and see what
the world is like on the other side.

Best of luck...go make it happen.

Adverse Consequences of Alcohol Abuse and Dependence
Adverse Consequences of Alcohol Abuse and DependenceW. Alexander Morton, Pharm.D., BCPPProfessor of Pharmacy PracticeAssociate Professor ofPsychiatry and Behavioral SciencesMedical University of South Carolina;Institute of Psychiatry, Charleston, SC
Sophie Robert, Pharm.D.Psychiatric Pharmacy Practice ResidentMedical University of South Carolina,Charleston, SC
Alcohol, also known as ethanol and ethyl alcohol, is an interesting drug for a numberof reasons. Although most consumers do not consider alcohol to be a drug, alcohol in fact may be the most thoroughly studied of all drugs. The scientific literature contains numerous documented effects of alcohol.1 However, many healthcare practitioners fail to appreciate the clinical picture produced by alcohol in patients with undiagnosed conditions who use or abuse alcohol. When presented with a case involving early physical symptoms of alcohol abuse, primary care physicians in one study failed to diagnose the problem 94% of the time.2 In addition to its other adverse events, alcohol is thought to be responsible for up to 105,000 deaths per year, not including deaths attributed to drunken driving.1
This article is intended to help health practitioners recognize some of the physical and mental complications of alcohol abuse and dependence in patients with undiagnosed illnesses. The information provided can help practitioners formulate treatment plans for patients who use alcohol and who have concomitant medical and psychiatric illnesses. In addition, it may be used to educate patients, helping them view alcohol differently when they have difficulty recognizing their alcohol use as a problem.
Popular Myths About Alcohol Use
People consuming excessive amounts of alcohol will use several popular myths to justify their continued drinking. These myths are discussed below:
Alcohol is good for your heart. Overall, excess alcohol is bad for the heart because the heart has to work harder and it may function irregularly.
Alcohol protects against heart attacks. This is only partly true. Alcohol decreases the “bad” cholesterol (LDL) and increases the “good” cholesterol (HDL). When used in small amounts, alcohol has been associated with less coronary heart disease. This fact is often cited by alcoholics in an attempt to justify their continued use. The main problem with this rationalization is that alcoholics do not drink small amounts.
Alcohol relaxes you. Alcohol does act to relax a person as the blood alcohol level rises. However, alcohol levels above modest limits can actually make one more anxious as alcohol is eliminated from the body.
Alcohol helps you sleep. Alcohol does help people fall asleep; however, middle-of-the-night awakening is common, as well as inability to fall back asleep. Adverse effects on sleep have been documented to last for months after alcohol has been stopped.

Effects of AlcoholThe unique properties of alcohol have been linked to its effects on the cell membrane.3 In general, the cell membrane regulates the activity and stability of the cell. Alcohol nonspecifically increases cell membrane permeability. In addition, it affects various neurotransmitters and their receptors, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and serotonin.3 Thus, for any cell within the body, alcohol can exert an effect–including possible adverse events. This ability alone is enough to consider alcohol a universal cellular toxin. However, the toxic effects of alcohol frequently are not seen until after many years of use.
Absorption and Distribution: Alcohol is quickly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach.4 Food and juice slow the absorption, thus, the effects.5 Most people like alcohol because it works quickly (within 5 to 15 minutes). There is a connection between choice of abused substances and the rate at which the drug produces desirable effects: the faster the onset of action, the higher the abuse potential.6
Alcohol is distributed throughout all fluids and tissues of the body, in proportion to their water content;7 this is one reason why it causes so many problems and systemic complications. Women usually have more fat tissue than men, and will generally achieve higher blood alcohol concentration when given the same dose of alcohol per kg of total body weight.7
Pharmacology: Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant.8 While some excitatory transmitter systems are enhanced by acute alcohol ingestion, most of them are inhibited. The inhibitory transmitter systems are augmented, resulting in disinhibition. Because of this decrease in inhibition, people’s behavior may change dramatically. As a result of its interaction with various neurotransmitters and receptors, alcohol produces changes in the channels of the cell membrane to allow influx and efflux of ions, such as chloride, calcium, sodium, and potassium.8 This change in ion flux leads to changes in cellular polarization which, for the most part, results in inhibition of neurotransmission.
Metabolism: Alcohol is eliminated predominantly by breakdown in the liver. It is primarily metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, which is then rapidly destroyed by aldehyde dehydrogenase.9 On average, the body metabolizes 1 oz (30 mL) of alcohol in about 3 hours, although this metabolism rate is weight-dependent.10 Genetically controlled variants of these enzymes in ethnic groups such as the Asian population are associated with a lower risk of alcoholism.11 This fact has led to the hypothesis that higher acetaldehyde levels produce an uncomfortable sensation that can deter excessive use. A small amount of alcohol–usually less than 1%–is eliminated unchanged through the lungs. This contributes to the odor of alcohol on one’s breath.4
Approved UsesThere are numerous industrial uses for alcohol, including as a germicide and a solvent; however, medical indications and approved uses are limited.10 The only FDA-approved indication is in combination with dextrose as an intravenous solution for increasing caloric intake and replenishing fluids.12 Alcohol has an unapproved use in the treatment and slowing of premature labor.12 It has also been used to treat methanol poisoning10 and as a pain reliever when injected into a nerve to cause neural toxicity.10
Adverse EffectsAlcohol can produce a variety of adverse effects at different stages of use (FIGURE 1)10,13,14 Stages of use include acute ingestion of moderate amounts, severe intoxication, chronic ingestion, withdrawal, and effects as a result of malnutrition. Mental and psychiatric adverse events include anxiety, panic, sedation, euphoria, irritability, restlessness, aggressiveness, violence, depression, sleep disturbances, memory and cognitive deficits, confabulation, hallucinations, and delusions. A lifetime comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric disorders of 86% has been reported, and often there is a worsening of psychiatric diagnoses.15,16
CNS effects can include headaches, cerebral atrophy, ataxia, and seizures. Skull fractures and subdural hematoma can occur. The eyes may undergo blurred vision, loss of vision, or color vision abnormalities. Cardiovascular effects can include cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, coronary artery disease (with heavy consumption), hypertension, edema, increased risk of stroke with heavy drinking (especially hemorrhagic), but possible reduced risk of ischemic stroke with moderate doses. Respiratory effects can range from increased risk of pneumonia to asthma or acute respiratory distress.
GI effects include gastritis, ulcers, bleeding, malabsorption of food and nutrients such as vitamins, diarrhea or constipation, and esophageal varices. Liver problems include fatty liver, hepatitis, jaundice, fibrosis, cirrhosis, blood coagulopathies, hypoprotenemia, and ascites. Pancreatitis can develop. Genitourinary disorders such as electrolyte imbalances, urinary tract infections, and sexual dysfunction may occur. Neurological complications include paresthesias, peripheral neuropathies, extrapyramidal symptoms and pain as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. Musculoskeletal problems such as myalgias, cramps, atrophy, weakness, joint inflammation, worsening of rheumatoid arthritis, gout, bone ischemia, necrosis, and hypofunctioning marrow can arise.
Hematological disorders are common and include iron deficiency anemia, macrocytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Dermatological adverse effects can include dermatitis, flushing, angiomas, urticaria, bruising, and sweating. Endocrine complications include altered glucose tolerance, unstable diabetes, menstrual cycle irregularities, and gynecomastia. In addition, the immune system has an impaired response. Finally, alcohol use has been associated with neoplasms in the upper digestive and respiratory tracts, liver, and with possible increases in breast and large bowel cancers.
Drug InteractionsAlcohol can alter the elimination of certain drugs by affecting gastric emptying, hence their absorption, or liver metabolism.17 Binge drinking is associated with inhibition of cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), whereas chronic heavy alcohol intake induces the activity of that enzyme group. Induction of CYP2E1 can lead to production of metabolites more toxic than the parent compound, such as is seen with concomitant use of acetaminophen.17 Alcohol can also enhance the adverse effects of various drugs, especially the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and older antihistamines.17
Use of alcohol in combination with cocaine can produce cocaethylene. This metabolite has a higher toxicity than either agent alone and has been found to produce marked toxicity.18 Recently, the combination of alcohol and methylphenidate has been found to undergo the same transformation, and may be the cause of serious adverse events.19
Long-Term UsePeople who use alcohol regularly over several months can become physically dependent on it. Upon abruptly stopping, withdrawal will start within 4 to 12 hours. The symptoms will vary considerably from person to person. Sometimes the person will be asymptomatic. Withdrawal can last from 3 to 10 days. If severe withdrawal occurs and goes untreated, death can result.20
Many alcohol-dependent people never go into withdrawal because they are always drinking small amounts. Morning drinking may be an attempt to treat withdrawal. Very few people drink in the morning to get intoxicated or drunk; instead they drink to maintain performance at work. Tolerance to alcohol occurs quickly, so that more is needed to produce the same effect.21 People who can “hold their liquor” have most likely developed tolerance.8,22
Alcohol DependenceChemical dependence on alcohol affects almost every aspect of a person’s life. In addition to the physical and mental effects cited, a person with alcohol problems will usually have major problems at work or school, with his or her family, or with friends. Financial and legal problems are also usually present. For a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, a person need only have three of the following:23
-Tolerance to the effects of alcohol so that a person needs more to produce the wanted effect–or gets less effect with the same amount.
-Withdrawal such that characteristic symptoms occur when the person stops drinking–or the person drinks to relieve withdrawal symptoms.
-Alcohol is consumed in larger amounts–or for a longer time than was intended.
-A person makes repeated attempts to cut down or control the amount of alcohol consumed.
-A lot of time is spent in obtaining alcohol or recovering from its effects (hangover).
-Important social or recreational activities are given up because of alcohol use.
-A person continues to drink even though he or she knows his or her medical or psychiatric problem is made worse by drinking.
Acute ToxicityAcute ingestion of large amounts of alcohol can result in death due to cardiovascular collapse and respiratory arrest. Blood levels associated with coma and death average 400 mg/dL;10 however, this varies considerably; some individuals have tolerated levels as high as 1,510 mg/dL.24 (Hangover is the aftereffects of consuming alcohol and is usually related to amount consumed. It may be a combination of mild withdrawal and side effects, both mental and physical.)25
Despite the common belief that beer, wine, and liquor have different pharmacological effects, these effects depend only on the percentage of alcohol contained in the beverage. Certain substances in various beverages have been reported to produce more hangover effects. Some beverages also can be consumed faster than others, but the active ingredient is still ethyl alcohol.
TreatmentAlcohol dependence is straightforward, but difficult to treat. Withdrawal is usually treated with a safer, cross-tolerant drug; benzodiazepines are the agents of choice.26 Treatment is given for only 3-7 days to reduce the associated 10% death rate closer to 0%-1%.20 Concomitant medical and psychiatric problems, which are frequent, need to be addressed and treated effectively.20 Education about the disease of alcoholism is essential. Supportive treatment in the form of psychotherapy and group therapy is often initiated.20 Family therapy is almost always indicated, as there is often serious dysfunction in an alcoholic’s family. Most people are encouraged to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), as this is one consistent modality that helps people recover.20
Comorbid psychiatric disorders need aggressive treatment, usually with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. Referral to practitioners with experience in addiction treatment may be useful in developing a successful treatment plan to prevent or minimize relapse. Recovering addicts may require initial and/or long-term treatment with nonaddictive medications. Pharmacological treatment of ethanol dependence with agents, e.g., naltrexone, can reduce drinking frequency and relapse rate.27 All substances with potential for abuse should be stopped and avoided.28 Learning and practicing alternative, safe activities that produce pleasure and decrease stress is essential in treatment and recovery.20
ConclusionAlcohol is a drug. Practitioners need to be reminded that excessive use and/or high doses of alcohol can have profound effects on almost every system in the human body. Many medical and psychiatric conditions are often exacerbated, making these conditions difficult to control. FIGURES 1 and 2 help to demonstrate potential adverse effects of alcohol and may help practitioners rethink a patient’s treatment plan if alcohol is involved and the patient is not responding optimally.

THE MANAGEMENT OF WITHDRAWAL SYNDROMES
DETOXIFICATION FROM STIMULANT DRUGS
Abrupt cessation of stimulant (amphetamine, cocaine)
use is associated with depression, anergia, anhedonia,
increased drug craving, increased appetite, hypersomnolence
and increased REM sleep (Weiss, Greenfield &
Mirin, 1994). This initial period of intense symptoms
is commonly termed the 'crash', which is usually selflimiting
to a period of days. There have been reports
of myocardial ischaemia occurring in the first week of
stimulant withdrawal (Nademanee, Gorelick et al, 1989)
although this is uncommon, and other medical effects
are relatively minor.
The 'dopamine deficiency' hypothesis of stimulant
withdrawal has not been supported by clinical practice -
controlled clinical trials of dopamine agonists have
yielded inconsistent results. Similarly the use of tricyclic
antidepressants to limit the effects of withdrawal on the
basis that they inhibit presynaptic catecholamine neurotransmitter
uptake, have failed to deliver any significant
benefit. Antidepressants may however be useful in the
treatment of an on-going depressive disorder associated
with stimulant drug misuse.
The stimulant withdrawal syndrome is thus best treated
supportively and symptomatically by allowing the patient
to sleep and eat as much as necessary. A benzodiazepine
The stimulant withdrawal syndrome is best
treated supportively and symptomatically
by allowing the patient to sleep and eat
as much as necessary.
A benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide
may be helpful in selected patients who
develop agitation or sleep disturbance.
such as chlordiazepoxide may be helpful in selected patients who develop agitation or sleep disturbance (Pearsall & Rosen, 1992); these should not be continued
any longer than two weeks. Neuroleptics should be
avoided because of their potential to induce dysphoric
side-effects.
As for opiate drugs, the chronic stimulant misuser is
likely to experience a protracted withdrawal syndrome
for months or even years which is characterised by
depressed mood, lethargy and anhedonia together with
intense craving. There is no specific pharmacological
antidote for this syndrome or to limit the likelihood of
relapse, although concurrent depressive disorder may
respond to antidepressants.
In conclusion, the management of stimulant drug
misuse is largely psycho-social at all stages.

Alcohol withdrawal - delirium tremens
• A •
Feb 12 05
Tweet
Alternative names
DT’s; Delirium tremens
Definition
Delirium tremens is a disorder involving sudden and severe mental changes (psychosis) or neurologic changes (including seizures) caused by abruptly stopping the use of alcohol. Rapid pulse rate, elevated blood pressure, and temperature elevation also may be present.
Causes, incidence, and risk factors
Delirium tremens can occur after a period of heavy alcohol drinking, especially when the person does not eat enough food.
It may also be triggered by Head injury, infection, or illness in people with a history of heavy use of alcohol. It is most common in people who have a history of experiencing alcohol withdrawal when alcohol is stopped, especially in those who drink the equivalent of 7 to 8 pints of beer (or 1 pint of “hard” alcohol) per day for several months, and in those with a history of habitual alcohol use or alcoholism that has existed for more than 10 years.
Symptoms occur because of the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain and nervous system. They may be severe and progress rapidly.
Symptoms
Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal
o Feeling jumpy or nervous
o Feeling shaky
o Anxiety
o Irritability or easily excited
o Emotional volatility, rapid emotional changes
o Depression
o Fatigue
o Difficulty thinking clearly
o Palpitations (sensation of feeling the heart beat)
o Headache, general, pulsating
o Sweating, especially the palms of the hands or the face
o Nausea
o Vomiting
o Loss of appetite
o Insomnia, difficulty falling asleep
o Pale skin
Mental status changes
o Mood changes rapidly
o Restlessness
o Increased activity
o Decreased attention span
o Excitement
o Fear
o Confusion, disorientation
o Agitation, irritability
o Hallucinations, visual hallucinations (snakes, bugs, etc.) are most common
o Sensory hyperacuity (highly sensitive to light, sound, touch, etc.)
o Delirium (severe, acute loss of mental functions)
o Decreased mental status
+ Stuporous, somnolent, lethargic
+ Deep sleep that persists for a day or longer
+ Usually occurs after acute symptoms
Seizures
o Usually generalized tonic-clonic seizures
o Most common in first 24 - 48 hours
o Most common in people with previous alcohol withdrawal Complications
Body tremors
Additional symptoms that may be occur:
Fever
Stomach pain
Chest pain
Note: Symptoms most commonly occur within 72 hours after the last drink, but may occur up to 7 to 10 days after the last drink. Symptoms may progress rapidly.
Signs and tests
Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. The health care provider should be consulted promptly.
An examination of the neuromuscular system may show an increased startle reflex, rapid rhythmic muscle tremor, or other changes indicating alcohol withdrawal. Evidence of increased autonomic function—such as profuse sweating—may be present.
There may be symptoms of dehydration or Malnutrition, and signs indicating electrolyte disturbances. An eye inspection may show abnormalities of eye muscle movement—such as lid lag. The heart rate may be rapid, and there may be an irregular heart beat. The blood pressure may be normal, elevated, or low.
A serum toxicology screen is usually positive for alcohol. Serum chemistry (chem-20) may show electrolyte disturbances, especially decreased levels of potassium and magnesium. An ECG (electrocardiogram) may show arrhythmias. An EEG (electroencephalogram) may be performed to rule out other causes of seizures.
Treatment
This is an emergency condition. The goals of treatment are saving the patient’s life, treating the immediate symptoms, and preventing Complications. Long-term preventive treatment may begin after initial treatment of the acute condition. Hospitalization is required. Vital signs (temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure), and fluid and electrolyte status are monitored, and abnormalities are treated as appropriate.
Seizures and cardiovascular conditions, such as heart arrhythmias, are treated as appropriate. This may include lifesaving or life-support measures, anticonvulsant medications such as phenytoin, or other medications. Clonidine may reduce cardiovascular symptoms, and helps reduce anxiety. Central nervous system depressants and sedatives may be required, often in large doses, to reduce symptoms.
Treatment may require maintenance of a sedated state for a week or more until withdrawal is complete. Benzodiazepine medications such as diazepam are often useful to provide sedation. Diazepam is also useful to treat seizures as well as anxiety and tremors.
Hallucinations are treated similarly to any acute psychotic episode, with hospitalization as needed. Cautious use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, may be necessary in some cases.
A “drying out” period may be appropriate. No alcohol is allowed during this time. Treatment for alcohol use or alcoholism is recommended. This may include psychologic interventions, social supports such as AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), behavior modification, or other interventions.
Testing and treatment for other medical problems associated with use of alcohol is necessary. This may include disorders such as alcoholic liver disease, blood clotting disorders, alcoholic neuropathy, heart disorders (such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy), chronic brain syndromes (such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome).
Support Groups
For additional resources, see alcoholism support group.
Expectations (prognosis)
Delirium tremens is serious and may be life-threatening. Symptoms such as sleeplessness, feeling tired, and emotional instability may persist for a year or more.
Complications
Seizures
Heart arrhythmias, may be life-threatening
Injury from falls during seizures
Injury to self or others caused by mental state (confusion/delirium)
Calling your health care provider
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if symptoms develop. Delirium tremens is an emergency condition!
Prevention
Avoid or minimize the use of alcohol. Treat known alcoholism appropriately. Obtain prompt medical treatment for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Also, look into alcohol detoxification or “detox” centers in your area, as well as alcohol rehabilitation centers or “rehab” facilities.

Alcoholism
28
Feb2012
Posted by DeUnique in Biogetica
Causes of Alcoholism
There is no known physical cause that leads to alcohol abuse. Certain factors that contribute to alcoholism are as follows:
Cultural Factors: Patterns of alcohol consumption are considered to be a reflection of one’s financial status. There is a close correlation between the consumption of alcohol and also the price of alcohol and income levels.
Often, people adopt this habit just to fit in with peers.
Having friends who drink regularly can promote excessive drinking.
Emotional Factors: People who are anxious or under a lot of stress are more prone to consuming alcohol, as it is said to temporarily release certain ‘feel good’ hormones in the body.
Psychological Factors: Those suffering from depression and poor self-esteem tend to acquire this habit very easily. It is said that alcohol alters the balance of certain chemicals within the brain that inhibit impulsiveness and excite the nervous system.
Addiction: Over a period of time, alcohol becomes an addiction. Alcohol raises the levels of dopamine in the brain, which gives the ‘kick’ or pleasurable effect associated with drinking. Long-term drinking, however, depletes the levels of these chemicals, making the body crave for alcohol to restore the ‘good’ feeling. Thus, it becomes a vicious cycle.
Symptoms of Alcohol Abuse
Almost all people who suffer from alcohol abuse live in denial of it. They rarely accept that they have a problem that needs to be treated. They often drink when they are alone, and hide alcohol away from people’s view, in order to not be found out.
Excessive drinking can lead to the following symptoms:
– Loss of concentration
– Irritability when unable to get a drink
– Emotional problems with partners or other relationships
– Inability to remember important schedules or events
– Constantly thinking up various excuses to drink
– Withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, sweating and nervousness if not able to get a drink
Problems Caused Due to Alcoholism
Social Problems:
Social problems that ensue from alcoholism include absenteeism from work, unemployment, marital tensions, child abuse, financial difficulties and problems with the law, including violence and traffic offences.
Physical Problems:
Cardiovascular system – High blood pressure
Gastrointestinal system – Acidity; Inflammation of the pancreas; Poor absorption leading to deficiencies; Cancer
Liver – Inflammation; Fatty deposits; Cirrhosis; Cancer
Nervous system – Brain hemorrhage; Loss of memory; Premature degeneration
Respiratory system – Pneumonia; Tuberculosis
Endocrine system – Low blood sugar; Cushing’s syndrome
Reproductive system – Infertility; Fetal alcohol syndrome
Skin – Acne; Erythema
Vitamin deficiencies – These occur due to an impoverished diet. The most common is Thiamine (B1) deficiency.
Direct toxic effects on the brain – There are periods of amnesia for events that occurred during bouts of intoxication.
Psychological Problems:
Depression – This is very common in alcoholism, and is usually a result of the numerous social problems that heavy drinking creates. Alcohol also acts like a direct depressant. Suicide and attempted suicide is more common in alcoholics.
Morbid Jealousy – This is a syndrome characterized by delusions of sexual infidelity. It is usually seen in alcoholics of sensitive or paranoid disposition, whose sexual relationship has deteriorated because of impotence or rejection by the partner.
Withdrawal Symptoms – These indicate physical dependence. The earliest manifestation is a subjective sensation of tension on waking in the morning. This may be accompanied by tremors. Another alcoholic drink relieves these symptoms, thus establishing a pattern of morning drinking.
Indirect Effects on Behavior – These can result from head injury or lowered blood sugar levels.
Alcoholism Treatment Options
Conventional Therapy
Straightforward advice about the harmful effects of alcohol and safe levels of consumption is sometimes all that is needed.
In more serious cases of alcohol abuse, patients may have to be advised to alter leisure activities or change jobs, if these factors are contributing to the problem.
Supportive psychotherapy is often crucial in helping the patient effect the necessary changes in lifestyle. Interpretive psychotherapy, either individual or group, can help patients who have relapses. Treatment of this type is available at specialized centers, and is also provided by voluntary organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).
Drugs
Drugs are used at various stages of alcoholism treatment.
Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for withdrawal symptoms and can be safely given in large doses, provided they are tailed off over a period of 5-7 days, as symptoms subside.
It is customary to give high doses of vitamins during withdrawal treatment, because of the possibility of thiamine deficiency.
Anti-depressants are given if symptoms of depression are present along with alcoholism.
Disulfiram (Antabuse 200-400mg daily) can be given as a deterrent, for patients who find it difficult to resist sudden impulses to drink, after being abstinent. The drug blocks the metabolism of alcohol, causing acetaldehyde to accumulate in the body. Alcohol, if consumed while on the drug, produces an unpleasant reaction consisting of headache, flushing, nausea and labored breathing. The Knowledge that this reaction will occur deters drinking and can even stop the craving. Disulfiram should always be seen as an adjunct to other alcoholism treatments, especially supportive psychotherapy.
Naltrexone, a drug known to block the narcotic effects can also be used to reduce the urge for drinking. This is also available in injectable form, which is to be taken once a month. It may reduce the urge to drink by blocking the neurotransmitters in the brain which are thought to be associated with alcohol dependence.
Biogetica Therapy for Alcoholism
To put it very simply, there are 2 main reasons you have not been able to give up drinking – Physical dependence and Psychological dependence. Biogetica uses natural remedies to ease your withdrawal symptoms, thus making giving up alcohol easier.* The natural remedies in the kits work specifically by:
• Balancing your emotional, mental and physiological responses, thus ensuring lasting relief, and encouraging permanent commitment to an alcohol-free life*

• Helping to clear toxins from your liver*

DESCRIPTION
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative. Chemically, diazepam is 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a colorless to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water and has a molecular weight
of 284.74. Its structural formula is as follows:
Each tablet for oral administration contains 2 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg diazepam and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal
silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch and sodium lauryl sulfate. The following
coloring agents are employed:
2 mg - none
5 mg - FD&C Yellow #6
10 mg - FD&C Blue #1 and D&C Yellow #10
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus and hypothalamus, and induces calming effects.
Diazepam, unlike chlorpromazine and reserpine, has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor does it produce
extrapyramidal side effects; however, animals treated with diazepam do have a transient ataxia at higher doses. Diazepam was
found to have transient cardiovascular depressor effects in dogs. Long-term experiments in rats revealed no disturbances of
endocrine function.
Oral LD50 of diazepam is 720 mg/kg in mice and 1240 mg/kg in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 400 mg/kg to a monkey resulted
in death on the sixth day.
Reproduction Studies
A series of rat reproduction studies was performed with diazepam in oral doses of 1, 10, 80 and 100 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg there
was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and surviving offspring in these rats. Neonatal survival of rats at doses lower
than 100 mg/kg was within normal limits. Several neonates in these rat reproduction studies showed skeletal or other defects.
Further studies in rats at doses up to and including 80 mg/kg/day did not reveal teratological effects on the offspring.
In humans, measurable blood levels of diazepam were obtained in maternal and cord blood, indicating placental transfer of
the drug.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Diazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety
or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.
In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute
delirium tremens and hallucinosis.
Diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation
of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma); spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy
and paraplegia); athetosis; and stiffman syndrome.
Oral diazepam may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.
The effectiveness of diazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical
studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Diazepam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug and, because of lack of sufficient clinical
experience, in pediatric patients under 6 months of age. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving
appropriate therapy, but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.
WARNINGS
Diazepam is not of value in the treatment of psychotic patients and should not be employed in lieu of appropriate treatment.
As is true of most preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving diazepam should be cautioned against engaging
in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.
As with other agents which have anticonvulsant activity, when diazepam is used as an adjunct in treating convulsive disorders,
the possibility of an increase in the frequency and/or severity of grand mal seizures may require an increase in the dosage
of standard anticonvulsant medication. Abrupt withdrawal of diazepam in such cases may also be associated with a temporary
increase in the frequency and/or severity of seizures.
Since diazepam has a central nervous system depressant effect, patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion
of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam therapy.
Usage in Pregnancy
An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (diazepam, meprobamate and chlordiazepoxide)
during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter
of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of child-bearing potential
may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become
pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability
of discontinuing the drug.
Management of Overdosage
Manifestations of diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes. Respiration, pulse and
blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal
following overdosage. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids
should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol.
Dialysis is of limited value. As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that
multiple agents may have been ingested.
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative
effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior
to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous
access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients
treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects
for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine
users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior
to use.
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines. (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.)
PRECAUTIONS
If diazepam is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given
to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly with known compounds which may potentiate the action of diazepam,
such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants. The usual precautions are indicated
for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression; particularly the recognition
that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. The usual precautions in treating patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.
In elderly and debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude
the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2½ mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed
and tolerated).
The clearance of diazepam and certain other benzodiazepines can be delayed in association with cimetidine administration.
The clinical significance of this is unclear.
Information for Patients
To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce
psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the
dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue and ataxia. Infrequently encountered were confusion, constipation,
depression, diplopia, dysarthria, headache, hypotension, incontinence, jaundice, changes in libido, nausea, changes in salivation,
skin rash, slurred speech, tremor, urinary retention, vertigo and blurred vision. Paradoxical reactions such as acute hyperexcited
states, anxiety, hallucinations, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, rage, sleep disturbances and stimulation have been
reported; should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.
Because of isolated reports of neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during
long-term therapy. Minor changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during
and after diazepam therapy and are of no known significance.
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE
Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and
muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of diazepam. The more severe withdrawal
symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally
milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines
taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation
should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts
or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving diazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition
of such patients to habituation and dependence.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs
of most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to
avoid adverse effects.
ADULTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Management of Anxiety Disorders and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety: Depending upon severity of symptoms-2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal: 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed.
Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm: 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.
Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Geriatric Patients, or in the Presence of Debilitating Disease: 2 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.
PEDIATRIC PATIENTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in
pediatric patients under 6 months—1 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.

DESCRIPTION
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative. Chemically, diazepam is 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a colorless to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water and has a molecular weight
of 284.74. Its structural formula is as follows:
Each tablet for oral administration contains 2 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg diazepam and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal
silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch and sodium lauryl sulfate. The following
coloring agents are employed:
2 mg - none
5 mg - FD&C Yellow #6
10 mg - FD&C Blue #1 and D&C Yellow #10
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus and hypothalamus, and induces calming effects.
Diazepam, unlike chlorpromazine and reserpine, has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor does it produce
extrapyramidal side effects; however, animals treated with diazepam do have a transient ataxia at higher doses. Diazepam was
found to have transient cardiovascular depressor effects in dogs. Long-term experiments in rats revealed no disturbances of
endocrine function.
Oral LD50 of diazepam is 720 mg/kg in mice and 1240 mg/kg in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 400 mg/kg to a monkey resulted
in death on the sixth day.
Reproduction Studies
A series of rat reproduction studies was performed with diazepam in oral doses of 1, 10, 80 and 100 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg there
was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and surviving offspring in these rats. Neonatal survival of rats at doses lower
than 100 mg/kg was within normal limits. Several neonates in these rat reproduction studies showed skeletal or other defects.
Further studies in rats at doses up to and including 80 mg/kg/day did not reveal teratological effects on the offspring.
In humans, measurable blood levels of diazepam were obtained in maternal and cord blood, indicating placental transfer of
the drug.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Diazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety
or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.
In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute
delirium tremens and hallucinosis.
Diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation
of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma); spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy
and paraplegia); athetosis; and stiffman syndrome.
Oral diazepam may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.
The effectiveness of diazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical
studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Diazepam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug and, because of lack of sufficient clinical
experience, in pediatric patients under 6 months of age. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving
appropriate therapy, but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.
WARNINGS
Diazepam is not of value in the treatment of psychotic patients and should not be employed in lieu of appropriate treatment.
As is true of most preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving diazepam should be cautioned against engaging
in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.
As with other agents which have anticonvulsant activity, when diazepam is used as an adjunct in treating convulsive disorders,
the possibility of an increase in the frequency and/or severity of grand mal seizures may require an increase in the dosage
of standard anticonvulsant medication. Abrupt withdrawal of diazepam in such cases may also be associated with a temporary
increase in the frequency and/or severity of seizures.
Since diazepam has a central nervous system depressant effect, patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion
of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam therapy.
Usage in Pregnancy
An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (diazepam, meprobamate and chlordiazepoxide)
during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter
of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of child-bearing potential
may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become
pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability
of discontinuing the drug.
Management of Overdosage
Manifestations of diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes. Respiration, pulse and
blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal
following overdosage. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids
should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol.
Dialysis is of limited value. As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that
multiple agents may have been ingested.
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative
effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior
to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous
access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients
treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects
for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine
users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior
to use.
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines. (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.)
PRECAUTIONS
If diazepam is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given
to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly with known compounds which may potentiate the action of diazepam,
such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants. The usual precautions are indicated
for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression; particularly the recognition
that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. The usual precautions in treating patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.
In elderly and debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude
the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2½ mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed
and tolerated).
The clearance of diazepam and certain other benzodiazepines can be delayed in association with cimetidine administration.
The clinical significance of this is unclear.
Information for Patients
To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce
psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the
dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue and ataxia. Infrequently encountered were confusion, constipation,
depression, diplopia, dysarthria, headache, hypotension, incontinence, jaundice, changes in libido, nausea, changes in salivation,
skin rash, slurred speech, tremor, urinary retention, vertigo and blurred vision. Paradoxical reactions such as acute hyperexcited
states, anxiety, hallucinations, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, rage, sleep disturbances and stimulation have been
reported; should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.
Because of isolated reports of neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during
long-term therapy. Minor changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during
and after diazepam therapy and are of no known significance.
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE
Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and
muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of diazepam. The more severe withdrawal
symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally
milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines
taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation
should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts
or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving diazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition
of such patients to habituation and dependence.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs
of most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to
avoid adverse effects.
ADULTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Management of Anxiety Disorders and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety: Depending upon severity of symptoms-2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal: 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed.
Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm: 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.
Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Geriatric Patients, or in the Presence of Debilitating Disease: 2 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.
PEDIATRIC PATIENTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in
pediatric patients under 6 months—1 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.

DESCRIPTION
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative. Chemically, diazepam is 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a colorless to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water and has a molecular weight
of 284.74. Its structural formula is as follows:
Each tablet for oral administration contains 2 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg diazepam and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal
silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch and sodium lauryl sulfate. The following
coloring agents are employed:
2 mg - none
5 mg - FD&C Yellow #6
10 mg - FD&C Blue #1 and D&C Yellow #10
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus and hypothalamus, and induces calming effects.
Diazepam, unlike chlorpromazine and reserpine, has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor does it produce
extrapyramidal side effects; however, animals treated with diazepam do have a transient ataxia at higher doses. Diazepam was
found to have transient cardiovascular depressor effects in dogs. Long-term experiments in rats revealed no disturbances of
endocrine function.
Oral LD50 of diazepam is 720 mg/kg in mice and 1240 mg/kg in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 400 mg/kg to a monkey resulted
in death on the sixth day.
Reproduction Studies
A series of rat reproduction studies was performed with diazepam in oral doses of 1, 10, 80 and 100 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg there
was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and surviving offspring in these rats. Neonatal survival of rats at doses lower
than 100 mg/kg was within normal limits. Several neonates in these rat reproduction studies showed skeletal or other defects.
Further studies in rats at doses up to and including 80 mg/kg/day did not reveal teratological effects on the offspring.
In humans, measurable blood levels of diazepam were obtained in maternal and cord blood, indicating placental transfer of
the drug.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Diazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety
or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.
In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute
delirium tremens and hallucinosis.
Diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation
of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma); spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy
and paraplegia); athetosis; and stiffman syndrome.
Oral diazepam may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.
The effectiveness of diazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical
studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Diazepam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug and, because of lack of sufficient clinical
experience, in pediatric patients under 6 months of age. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving
appropriate therapy, but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.
WARNINGS
Diazepam is not of value in the treatment of psychotic patients and should not be employed in lieu of appropriate treatment.
As is true of most preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving diazepam should be cautioned against engaging
in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.
As with other agents which have anticonvulsant activity, when diazepam is used as an adjunct in treating convulsive disorders,
the possibility of an increase in the frequency and/or severity of grand mal seizures may require an increase in the dosage
of standard anticonvulsant medication. Abrupt withdrawal of diazepam in such cases may also be associated with a temporary
increase in the frequency and/or severity of seizures.
Since diazepam has a central nervous system depressant effect, patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion
of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam therapy.
Usage in Pregnancy
An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (diazepam, meprobamate and chlordiazepoxide)
during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter
of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of child-bearing potential
may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become
pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability
of discontinuing the drug.
Management of Overdosage
Manifestations of diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes. Respiration, pulse and
blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal
following overdosage. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids
should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol.
Dialysis is of limited value. As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that
multiple agents may have been ingested.
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative
effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior
to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous
access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients
treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects
for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine
users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior
to use.
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines. (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.)
PRECAUTIONS
If diazepam is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given
to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly with known compounds which may potentiate the action of diazepam,
such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants. The usual precautions are indicated
for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression; particularly the recognition
that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. The usual precautions in treating patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.
In elderly and debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude
the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2½ mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed
and tolerated).
The clearance of diazepam and certain other benzodiazepines can be delayed in association with cimetidine administration.
The clinical significance of this is unclear.
Information for Patients
To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce
psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the
dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue and ataxia. Infrequently encountered were confusion, constipation,
depression, diplopia, dysarthria, headache, hypotension, incontinence, jaundice, changes in libido, nausea, changes in salivation,
skin rash, slurred speech, tremor, urinary retention, vertigo and blurred vision. Paradoxical reactions such as acute hyperexcited
states, anxiety, hallucinations, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, rage, sleep disturbances and stimulation have been
reported; should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.
Because of isolated reports of neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during
long-term therapy. Minor changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during
and after diazepam therapy and are of no known significance.
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE
Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and
muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of diazepam. The more severe withdrawal
symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally
milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines
taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation
should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts
or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving diazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition
of such patients to habituation and dependence.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs
of most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to
avoid adverse effects.
ADULTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Management of Anxiety Disorders and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety: Depending upon severity of symptoms-2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal: 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed.
Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm: 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.
Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Geriatric Patients, or in the Presence of Debilitating Disease: 2 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.
PEDIATRIC PATIENTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in
pediatric patients under 6 months—1 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.

Alcohol Detox and Withdrawal
Alcohol is by far the most commonly abused drug in the United States. Government estimates say that more than 17 million Americans have a substance abuse issue with alcohol. A good percentage of these are heavy, daily drinkers. Consuming large quantities of alcohol on a regular basis can make the body dependent. In the most severe cases, alcohol withdrawal results in a condition called delirium tremens (D.T.'s), which can be fatal if not properly treated.
The classic sign of alcohol withdrawal is the ""shakes"" -- uncontrollable tremors that set in about 6 hours after the last drink. Thus many alcoholics need to drink alcohol in the morning just to steady their hands. Common symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include the following:
• Tremors (shakes)
• Irritability
• Insomnia
• Seizures
• Nausea / vomiting
• Hallucinations
• Delusions
• Agitation
• Rapid heart rate
• High blood pressure
Due to the possibility of seizures and D.T.s, it is necessary for people in alcohol withdrawal to be monitored closely by medical staff. At Sunrise Detox, we have an effective alcohol detox protocol that keeps our clients safe and comfortable during the detoxification process. Medications are used to prevent seizures and the onset of D.T.s, and our staff closely monitors the client's vital signs.

ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME
.
This information should be considered as informational in nature and is not intended to be a substitute for professional or clinical judgment. If you suspect that someone is having alcoholic withdrawal syndrom seek immediate medical care!
What is alcohol withdrawal syndrome?
Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a set of symptoms that people have when they suddenly stop drinking after using alcohol for a long period of time. Some people have mild shakiness and sweats. Some people hallucinate (hear and see things that don't exist). The worst form of withdrawal is called ""DTs"" (delirium tremens). DTs can be very serious if not treated by a doctor.
Withdrawal symptoms rarely occur in people who only drink once in a while. Symptoms usually occur in people who have been drinking heavily for weeks or months and then suddenly stop drinking. People who have gone through withdrawal before are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms each time they quit drinking.
Do people in withdrawal need to see a doctor?
Yes. Your doctor needs to know you're going through withdrawal so he or she can make sure it doesn't lead to more serious health problems. If you go through withdrawal a number of times without getting the right treatment, your symptoms may get worse each time. So even if your withdrawal symptoms don't seem that bad, it's important to see your doctor. This is especially true for people who have had a bad withdrawal before and people who have other health problems, such as infections, heart disease, lung disease or a history of seizures.
People who quit using other drugs (such as tobacco, injected drugs or cocaine) at the same time they stop drinking alcohol might have severe withdrawal problems. They should see a doctor before they quit.
What can a doctor do to help people in withdrawal?
A doctor can keep track of withdrawal symptoms so that more serious health problems don't develop. He or she can also give emotional support.
Medicines can control the shakiness, anxiety and confusion that come with alcohol withdrawal. Only a doctor can prescribe these medicines. If you take the medicines at an early stage of the withdrawal, they may keep your symptoms from getting worse.
What can family and friends do to help people going through withdrawal?
The urge to drink again during withdrawal can be very strong. Some people may put themselves into dangerous situations. After withdrawal symptoms go away, it's important for the person to pursue a treatment program or sobriety program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Support from family and friends can help a person find success in one of these programs.

Alcohol and Drugs: A dirty band-aid on a festering wound
Posted on January 18, 2011 by BillC
The use of alcohol and drugs, such as opiates*, are a very comforting tonic for emotional and even physical pain. Alcohol is very effective at dulling the pain. It is quick acting and makes us feel better very quickly. However, for many people, the use of alcohol or opiates is like putting a dirty band-aid on a festering wound.
Emotional pain, including grief, rejection, and sadness are natural and humanistic. The loss of a loved one, or the rejection by a lover, spouse, or family member can be devastating. Disappointment in others or disappointment in ourselves is sometimes too much to bear. And we don’t like to feel this natural feeling. We would rather dull the feeling and numb out. The use and abuse of alcohol, opiates, and benzo’s help us to numb out. They are very effective anesthetics.
While these substances are effective anesthetics, while they dull or eliminate the feeling, they don’t eliminate the cause of the feelings. So, once the numbing agent wears off, we are left to manage our feelings, that are now compounded by our use and abuse of substances. Alcohol, opiates, and benzos are very effective anesthetic agents, they are not effective coping agents.
If you are using alcohol and/ or drugs to anesthetize your pain, and your sick of it. Get help today. Call a program, call a detox, call your doctor, just let the cat out of the bag. Get into a treatment program somehow.
Executive Home Detox provides discreet in home services to clients who prefer privacy or convenience. We assist the client through an alcohol withdrawal and detoxification and we assist clients through an opiate withdrawal and detoxification. Give us a call if you need to.

Alcohol & Antidepressants Treatment Testimony – Feb 2012
“I completed the full program at Pur: the Medical Detox, the Sauna Detox and the Recovery Program. When I arrived at Pur, I was an alcoholic and was taking antidepressants. While sitting in the sauna one day, I had an incredible realization; I realized that I drank alcohol, took antidepressants, sleep medications, allergy medications, cold medications & NSAIDS, so that I wouldn’t “FEEL” pain, anger, depression, unhappiness, sadness, loneliness, restlessness, and crankiness. My new realization was: that those same substances did not allow me to “FEEL” happiness, pleasure, joy, fun, exhilaration, spontaneity, love and so much more.
“During my Recovery Phase of my program, I have learned many new truths. My favorite of these are the Two Rules For Happy Living:
“Rule #1 – Be able to experience ANYTHING!
“RULE #2 – Do only to others those things that can be experienced easily!
“Incredible Program! Incredible Staff! Incredible Results! Thank You!” – JQ Feb 2012

Alcohol Detox Testimony – Feb 2012
I found the process to be life altering. Not only was I aware of the toxins being released, the time spent in the sauna allowed me the opportunity to look at what brought me to this place in my life. Wow – very powerful stuff: the realizations that occurred!!” – JC Feb 2012

Benzo Detox Testimony – June 2011
I came to Pür because I couldn’t find anywhere else that I had any confidence could help me detox off Xanax. I had tried and failed at home, and no help from the “medical community” to get off the medication they so readily supplied. I knew it would be a battle, but I am so pleased with my entire experience here. Even on the worst of days, I felt safe, comfortable and taken care of; which is exactly what I needed. Having reached the other side, I feel I finally have my body, mind & spirit back. I had time to reflect on decisions made, someone always to talk to when I needed an ear and no judgements past. I very much feel I am leaving not only clean mentally & physically from the substance, but with a feeling of freedom and well being. Thank you to all that guided and travelled down this path next to me. - A.O. June 2011

Benzo Treatment Success – April 2011
I came to Pür Detox from a different treatment facility sick and filled with fear. The previous facility had not known how to properly detox me off of Benzodiazepines and so I was in worse shape from having been at the previous facility. Pür Detox ‘s program, staff, and doctor knew how to properly care for me and get me back on track on my progress off of the Benzodiazepines I had been on for 12 years. They truly showed me care and I felt safe and secure and will miss them and appreciate the life changing help that I received thru the program. – L.H.

The Sauna Detox Program – Jan 2011
The Sauna Program has allowed my body to regain much of its lost strength and weight. On top of that I became much more mentally alert and transformed back into my usual self again. Which feels great! – J.T.

Opiates Causing Persistent Pain – June 2010
“First, to know how the journey ended, you have to start at the “trailhead”! One can’t summit a mountain without taking that first step onto its foothills.
I started using pain meds (Soma, Oxycodone and Vicodin) due to a severe back injury and pain. At the time I arrived I was told I was “taking enough medication to kill 5 men each day. If I [surgeon talking] were to take just one pill of this I would be in a coma right now.”
The expression on my face didn’t react to this proclamation so he quickly followed up with, “Doesn’t that concern you? Don’t you want to live!? You have your wife sitting right next to you. Don’t you want to be around for her and your kids?!”
His suggestion was that I didn’t need surgery but instead needed to get off of the pain meds and my back pain would go away. THIS caused a change of expression in me. I even laughed. I asked, “How am I supposed to cure this back pain by going off the medication?!?” I’m scheduled for a triple fusion on my spine and you’re telling me all I have to do is get off the pain meds!!! You must be joking!”
He proceeded to tell me that a lot of times when your body gets “used to” (addicted to) pain meds, your brain and body can trick you into thinking you have pain when you really don’t.
It took me several days after walking out of his office to wrap my mind around this, but after talking to Christopher here at Pür Detox I learned of other instances where this came to be true.
I made my reservation and steeled myself for what someone dear to me metaphorically compared this “detox” journey to that of climbing a mountain; which meant to “suck it up and get through it”. And when I was finished, I could look through one of God’s windows, like all those mountain peaks I have stood on and know that free feeling once again.
When I got here I was told that due to the immense dosages I was consuming I would have to stay two weeks! I unpacked my “gear” and steeled myself once again for the “climb”! The second day was the worst – like climbing a 1,000 foot ice wall with no ropes or ice axes. But I didn’t complain. One staff member even dubbed me “the silent sufferer”. I was determined to climb this mountain at all costs!
After the first 3-4 days, most of my withdrawal symptoms were gone and metaphorically speaking, I was now on the ridge leading to the summit!!! I could see it and feel it! The staff was amazed as I was speeding through this recovery so much faster than expected! I sucked it up, put my head down and drove, one step after another, until I was standing on the summit. The best part was my back pain was pretty much gone!!
As I sat there looking through “God’s window” I realized that in addition to being pain free, I could think more clearly, I could reason once again and most importantly, I felt anything was possible!
As I passed my last “trail marker,” I was 27 pounds lighter, I felt hardly any pain, I felt like my old self again and I “walked off that mountain” 7 days earlier than expected!
In the end, I owe it all to God and the excellent staff at Pür Detox . Between the constant check-ups, the non-judgmental conversations and the top notch facilities and staff I’ve never before possessed better “climbing” tools to reach a summit. What started out as Mount Everest turned into Half Dome due to this fine facility.
I know there are other places you can go to “reach your summit” but I don’t know why you would want to! I haven’t ever been a part of a finer “summit team”. If I can do it, I know you can. Anything is possible if you want it bad enough – you just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other. And it wasn’t just the staff or the “tools” that made it easier, your fellow “climbers” help you up when you fall, carry your “pack” when it gets too heavy and even detail the easiest route to the “summit” from their own personal experiences. I couldn’t have done it without them!
As I stand at the foot of the mountain I have just conquered, I will summarize the pyramid of tools I used for success: God, an excellent and caring staff, and your fellow climbers. Without that balance, I wouldn’t have been successful!
‘I feel it’s important to not only be strong, but to feel strong…to test yourself in those most ancient of ways, just once and truly feel alive.’ – Alexander Supertramp.
I know if you begin your journey here, you too can look through God’s window and smile as he smiles down on you because this would have been the most important “summit” of your life. It was for me!” – R.A.

Saved From Alcohol – Nov 2009
“I was lying in a hotel room on an 8-day binge of worshipping my vodka and cursing it at the same time feeling the physical, emotional and spiritual pain of every swallow. After the 8th day, desperate to stop and not to die, I had a “moment of clarity”. I started a new journey that began at 6:00am that morning leading me by car from St. Louis, MO to Jackson, TN to my parent’s home begging them to help me get to a place where I could be SAVED.
Withdrawals already in full force and wanting to drink more for relief, we got on the phone to Pür Detox . Chris assured me they could help and had a place waiting just for me. My journey that day continued to Memphis, TN Airport escorted by my parents who watched me get onto an airplane heading for John Wayne Airport. There I was met by Chris himself as I got off the airplane feeling and seeing death. I was safely at Pur Detox ready for whatever was to come. By 11:30pm that same day my journey to get there began. With the caring, committed and understanding and professional staff at work, within 3 days I FELT life again and regained some dignity, self-worth and HOPE. I am proof that their philosophy of cleansing and flushing a body of its toxins with vitamins, minerals, supplements, anti-oxidants works! I do believe in miracles and I believe I am one of them because I am alive and well on my way to a life of recovery.” – J.S.

Fighting Benzo’s – Sept 2009
I am a 44 year old woman who has a history of mild anxiety. Last spring I began taking a benzo to alleviate the symptoms, which it did. When I tried to “go off” the benzos, my body was is such withdrawal that I was prescribed antidepressants. After taking these for a month, I began a new symptom: depression. The roller coaster of anxiety/depression/sleeplessness was incapacitating, and what eventually led me to despair and hopelessness. After months of trying to reduce the meds myself, I ended up coming to California to Pür Detox to engage in the sauna program to remove the residual chemicals from my tissues.
I was terrified to be here, but the love and support from the staff was what I needed to get through the detox process. I never felt more understood than I have here. They have seen it all! Nothing surprised or shocks them, which is why they are so trained to help you through each crisis as it arises. Sometimes it is just a walk to the beach with a companion that is needed to bring hope and perspective. Sometimes, it is a talk or meal on the patio. Sometimes, it is watching a funny video at 2 in the morning. The staff here seems to sense what you need and then deliver it.
The sauna program has helped me to rid my body of old toxins. Somewhere in the second week, I began to sense the depression lift. I could smile and laugh once again. The despair was not taking hold. I began to be able to commune with God again, to sense His presence, to know He was walking this road with me and had plans for my future.
Upon completing the program, I am now ready to return home with hope. I have learned tools to help with the residual anxiety that I have always had.
The funny thing is, I leave here with life-long friends who I will miss much and can call anytime for encouragement and understanding. We are all getting better and none of us are alone.
There is so much life to be lived. Pür Detox is a great place to get those are being controlled by drugs to get free of their grasp and to start to really live again, the way God intended. - L.B.

I am so grateful to everyone at the Pür Detox Program. I don’t believe anyone else would have been able to give us what we needed to help my son with his drug addictions and Paxil withdrawal. I’ve gained an enormous understanding about nutrition, addiction, pain management and alternatives to prescription drugs.
This program provided us with so much more than I expected and provided my son with immediate relief from pain, anxiety and depression, things I could not help him with.
I don’t think you can put a price on a person’s life or well being. The program was worth every penny. The staff is very friendly and supportive. The food is amazing.
The knowledge of the staff is very high and I found the night staff particularly helpful in alleviating my son’s pain in a caring and supportive manner. There is somewhat of a family atmosphere to Pür Detox and I felt comfortable there, in spite of having so much to adapt to.
I would love to see this program expanded all across North America, since I think it is unique amongst all detox/rehab programs. I would certainly recommend it as a first choice when seeking something beyond the typical 12 step program.
It may be possible to find similar treatment in other cities, but in reality, I think I would have had to argue with a doctor for months before they agreed to give my son an IV drip in Canada. Further, I might have been completely unsuccessful at even getting one for him. The IV drip was a true turning point for his pain and anxiety.
If I had to do it all over again (I don’t mean by way of relapse), I would absolutely change nothing, since I got what I was looking for, and I am purely grateful this program exists. - K.B.

When I first walked in to Pür Detox , I was on the verge of death, at least it felt that way, if I was feeling anything at all. I was strung out on 3 different pain killers, 2 benzos, 2 psychiatric drugs, muscle relaxants and more. I was a walking zombie. As I got off the drugs, ALL of them, over the next couple weeks, the fog over my body and mind slowly began to lift, yet I felt lifeless, zero energy, like a bystander watching others live life. I began the sauna program and saw and felt the results of the toxins pouring out of my body and it was no less than inspiring. This program for me, and anyone in my position is no less than miraculous. By far, and with more words than I can possibly express, this is the optimal manner to detoxify your body of the poisons from drugs, in the shortest time possible. The way I feel now, mentally clear and responsive, so vibrant and alert, really makes it hard for me and others to believe. Everyone I talk to for the first time comments on my level of alertness and clarity in speech and thinking. I now know I can handle any and all of the obstacles in my future life, obstacles that were complete roadblocks of doubt and fear previously. I had been to rehab before for some pretty nasty prescription and street drugs, without the sauna program. The difference in the way I feel now compared to the way I felt coming out of the last place is light years ahead this time. Before, it probably took 6 months to a year to get back to a relative normal mentality and I know I didn’t feel this good with this much clarity in mind and body. I am truly amazed and humbled by the blessing in my life of having gone to Pür Detox and having participated in the sauna program. I have to say how incredibly caring, supportive and helpful the staff of Pür Detox was to me. When I think of the whole experience of my time at Pür, it brings a tear to my eye to think of the level of pure charity and love that was shown to me. Theirs is more than a service or business, it truly is a labor of love. I’m sure, I never would have made it without the encouragement and constant level of care they continuously gave to me. To me, it is a miracle. - M.A.

To the staff of Pür Detox :
Just about 10 days ago I had a plan in action to take my life. I had been hoarding pills and the option to take them became a very viable answer to the total hopelessness I was feeling.
I have an incredible husband of 36 years and 4 children. The youngest is 4 and oldest 34. Today, the thought that I could actually choose to leave my family sends pure terror down my body.
Looking back, I did have the tools to know I had to have help; I could not do alone what I considered to be a lack in strength and intelligence. I knew that what I was doing was not working; every visit to the psychiatrist was just an addition of medication. It was as if I became completely lacking in feelings (up or down) then he had done his job. I turned my computer on and by my belief, the Grace of God opened the web page of Pür Detox . Alternative—Naturopathic—off medications not medically needed (or working) and using vitamin, mineral, all natural supplements? Was this my answer? It took only a second to ask for a call back. The call came in seconds and my questions were answered and something outside of my power loudly let me know this was what I was looking for.
Being a state away from this facility, I was met by a staff member within 5 hours of that call. I knew instinctively that this was exactly where I was supposed to be. I could hardly move, speak, eat, drink; however, I could believe that something might actually help me; I could sit in the possibility of a return to life. Although my first day was a holiday, the Medical Director came to the facility to assist in the beginning of a process to help me feel comfortable in my skin. There was something in this action that gave me the feeling that these people cared about me—someone in this world (other than my family) wanted me to know that I was worth feeling good; I was worth the time of these incredible people, even on a holiday! Me, who was just ready to leave this world being worthless, poor in spirit, lost, and terrified.
I have now experienced a group of men and women who are willing to walk to the beach at 1:00 AM if it might help in how I feel. I believe that is a very hard thing to dismiss. These wonderful people seemed to know intuitively what I needed (not necessarily what I wanted) and I believed in their way.
By day 4 here, I had a voice back, I had a smile back, again I say, I believed so strongly this was the right place for me. My body began to stop hurting, I began sleeping, eating, laughing, looking at a beautiful future. It has not always been easy and uphill—but there was always someone to help me see good, to help me see I was not alone. I was not condemned to live in a world of shadows; a world where I could not play with my 4 year old or my grandsons; a world that I could not be there for my husband and grown children. I realized I had hope again and my smile, (inside and out) began to grow. I know hope.
I no longer take (or crave) a medication (this includes benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hormone replacement therapy, just to name a few). These have been replaced and balanced in my system in a natural way.
I am writing only a few hours from leaving for home—a very short time to change my entire life. I do live in reality and know that it is not always going to be easy and someone will be there with an answer. I do know that change can occur and I know I can pick up the phone at anytime and talk with someone who knows and cares.
My husband and youngest daughter visited me just a few days ago and out of the mouth of babes, my 4 year old said “Momma, you have light in your eyes”. Is there a better testimony? Not for me—I want to be there as a Mom with that light—one that is real and not dimmed by medication/drugs.
If I wanted the research base, I could find it—it would only affirm what I am experiencing. I don’t need to look at the research—I want to live my life that has been returned to me.
I have never had to prove myself to anyone here. When I first walked through the doors, I had a feeling that I was trusted and I was believed. When I was unable to sleep at night—I was encouraged to sleep whenever I could. Rest is good for the body and soul. I have been in other facilities and there is no comparison for me. I truly believe I will live a longer and happier life continuing to do what I have been taught here. When I need help, I know where to call; I know where my call will be welcomed as coming home.
I was told last night by a dear friend who is also a patient here that I was the funniest person she had ever known. She is talking about someone who was unable to smile only a week ago. I laugh, I cry, I feel.
I would name the staff, but there are too many. Words can’t express what I feel about each and every one of you. You each have a very special place in my heart. My gratitude goes beyond what time provides me. From my heart and soul, thank you for believing in me and helping me cleanse body and soul. I have hope; I need say no more.
Thank You,
N.B.

August 2009
I have been on the Sauna Detox Program for 10 days now and have felt and experienced some pretty great things. My ability to concentrate, read and problem solve has dramatically increased. It is no longer a struggle to open up a book and read a few chapters, whereas before, simply reading a page would cause anxiety because of my inability to focus and retain information.
My mood has also begun to stabilize. The proportion of good vs. bad emotions during the day has changed for the better. I no longer find it as challenging just to make it through a simple day. I feel proud of myself for making it this far and I’m excited to feel, and witness any further changes. - S.S.

May 2009
Prior to doing my Sauna Detox ification Program, I’d been smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol everyday. I also had a 13 year history of heavy drug use, including LSD, ecstasy, crystal meth, cocaine… I became depressed and couldn’t understand what happened to the happy person I once thought I was. I was using the drugs to “have a good time” but it wasn’t working anymore. I’d fallen away from my family and lost friends. I was unable to create my own happiness anymore.
I started the Sauna Detox ification Program and immediately I felt life again. I couldn’t believe what a dark cloud the drugs had put over me until I started to flush my body clean of them. Day by day, I was able to see more clearly and vividly, food and water tasted better, my hearing improved, my thoughts turned from confused and introverted to extroverted and optimistic…it was like thin veils were being pulled off my senses and I was being given their full potential back. I actually began to feel the happiness of having myself back.
Now, I am interested. Reading is easier, I’m reading whole books now where before I couldn’t concentrate long enough to get through a few chapters, and I would just give up. My IQ increased 17 points. I can talk to people and listen without my mind wandering. Overall, I just feel like I’ve been given a new beginning in my life and I have the freedom again to live it!
This has been an amazing experience and I am forever grateful for it.
Thank you!
C.D.

Side effects of Librium/Chlordiazepoxide
September 2nd, 2011 | Add a Comment
Librium is the popular brand name of the generic drug chlordiazeprozide. It is used as an effective detoxification agent in acute alcohol withdrawal. Usually doctors start very high doses in alcohol withdrawal and gradually tailing it off over the time. Also it is used in management of anxiety disorders and short term relief of acute anxiety.
Side effects of Librium
Most common side effects are light headedness and drowsiness which can continue to the next day. If the patient is taking Librium for alcohol withdrawal, chances are high that he or she is taking high doses of the drug. This makes the side effects severe in patients who are taking the drug for alcohol withdrawal. This also makes operating machinery and driving pretty dangerous, so patients should avoid them during the drug course and at least three days after stopping the drug. Rarely excitation and aggression can occur (paradoxical excitation).
Confusion and ataxia (loss of full control of bodily movements) is also common. This usually manifest as a tremor when patient tries to move. Confusion and ataxia is common in elderly patients.
It can also cause amnesia. Muscle weakness is also common.
If the patient continues to take the drug for a longer period, then patient can become dependant on the drug. That means having withdrawal symptoms after stopping the drug. But abuse potential is lower with Librium.
Occasionally patients can complain headache. This can be controlled by taking over the counter pain killers such as acetaminophen.
Vertigo is another symptom that can occur occasionally.
Sometimes faintish ness can occur due to low blood pressure (Hypotension), which is a side effect of Librium. Some patients will have gastro intestinal disturbances like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. But they are common to most of the drugs.
Some patients will have visual hallucinations, illusions and various other visual disturbances but they are very uncommon.
Rarely patients can develop urinary incontinence or urinary retention.
Also rarely blood disorders like reduced white cell counts can occur.
It should be used cautiously in a patient with liver failure. Also there are harmful interactions with other central nervous system depressants like opiates.
Pregnancy
When using the drug regularly during pregnancy, it can cause neonatal withdrawal symptoms, neonatal hypothermia, neonatal hypotonia and neonatal respiratory depression. But it can be used if the risk of not using is higher than the side effects. So the decision is in your doctor’s hand.
Breast feeding
It’s present in breast milk. So avoid if possible.
Very Important!
Do not stop taking the drug without consulting your physician.

Librium Alternatives
Librium can cause side effects and many other possible problems which may lead a person to desire Librium alternatives help. The Alternative to Meds Center Arizona rehab has found successful methods that make this process less complicated, and relieve side effects or other potential problems.
Librium is used to lessen anxiety, control irritable bowel syndrome and to lessen the agitation that is caused from alcohol withdrawal; however, there are many valid reasons why users of this medication would want to try alternatives to Librium. First of all, this medication is part of an addictive group of drugs named benzodiazepines. Librium, also known as its generic name Chlordiazepoxide, can be very habit forming. Tolerance can develop to the drug after excessive or long-term use, making the medication less effective. Although getting off of this medication and trying Chlordiazepoxide alternatives may be a very effective and wonderful decision overall, this medication should not be stopped without medical consultation.Suddenly stopping the drug can worsen the condition for which the drug was prescribed and cause symptoms of withdrawal (irritability, sleeplessness, anxiousness). In addition to the easily habit-forming effects of this medication, the side effects can include suicidal thoughts, double vision, slurred speech, amnesia or memory loss, lack of coordination, difficulty urinating, muscle tremors, seizures, and when taken while pregnant, there is a possibility of birth defects. Benzodiazepines, such as Librium, Valium and Xanax most particularly affect GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the main neurotransmitter of the body. GABA communicates messages that are inhibitory, helping to offset and balance excitatory messages.Anxiety disorders can often be a result of reduced GABA levels. Medications such as Librium, Valium and Xanax spend all of the GABA. When the GABA is all gone, more side effects can present and everything is often over-stimulating. Unfortunately, many individuals do not realize that GABA is available in the form of a powder which can be taken as a nutritional supplement. However, taking a GABA supplement is usually not effective anyway after taking a benzodiazepine. This is because the toxicity from the benzodiazepine and the person’s environment will often impair the utilization of GABA supplements. Alternatives to Librium that are effective are usually uniquely created for each person to fit their individual needs.Many individuals seek Librium benzodiazepine alternatives help for a more effective way to relieve their symptoms, and sometimes they are just looking for natural alternatives to a chemically made drug. Mild types of anxiety can often respond very well to talk therapy or psychotherapy alone. In order to relieve symptoms of anxiety through talk therapy, natural benzodiazepine alternatives may be used concurrently. As an example, symptoms of anxiety are addressed with various health disciplines such as acupuncture, massage, vitamins and nutritional therapy, herbal medicine, Bach Flower Therapy, homeopathy and other benzodiazepine alternatives. As an adjunctive therapy to any anxiety treatment or used alone during bouts of anxiety, breath-work, relaxation training, meditation, and yoga can be incredibly helpful. Thought Field Therapies and other types of Energy Psychology have also been found to be very useful for therapeutic management of anxiety or other conditions.Librium is given to decrease anxiety, manage symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and promote sleep. However, when used for a prolonged time period, it will often produce more side-effects or other problems than it was meant to manage, including pronounced medication withdrawal. The Alternative to Meds Center Sedona drug treatment program discovers in most cases of anxiety that the person has an accumulation of toxins including heavy toxic metals that are causing over-stimulation to their nervous system. Benzodiazepines are the medications which we most commonly address, as an unsupported withdrawal may be virtually impossible. The methods used in our program for this particular type of drug, include careful tapering methods, cleansing of neurotoxins that accumulated in the individuals body from the drug and their environment, neurochemical stability using natural substances, peer support, and the endless benefits of many therapies targeted to induce relaxation including sauna, massage, acupuncture and meditation.Does it seem as though you have attempted every possible way of ending Librium and nothing works? Does your central nervous system ever feel over-excited or stimulated? With the majority of people, rapid approaches to Chlordiazepoxide alternatives are usually not effective in alleviating the real problem, as anxiousness stays present even if the drug is absent.We’ve worked with about one thousand persons in our 24 hour Sedona drug treatment atmosphere. Each week, previous benzo users graduate from our Arizona rehab program. Friends and family members come to these graduations, and can hardly believe it upon seeing how we found answers to the problems and how their loved one is now knowledgeable on how to sustain their lifestyle in a way that will add extra stability to their newfound happiness and peace.Please give us a call and receive an idea about the Librium alternatives help which can be made available for you or the one you love.Written By: Nicole Bonnet

Diazepam Withdrawal
Persons suffering from the painful experience of Diazepam withdrawal symptoms may face the most difficult withdrawal of any medication or drug. At Alternative to Meds Center, we have found Diazepam withdrawal help methods to ease this process, and alleviate withdrawal symptoms.
Abruptly ending treatment with Diazepam, also known as Valium, can lead to Diazepam withdrawal benzodiazepine symptoms including heart palpitations, personality changes, and hallucinations. Since withdrawing from this medication can potentially be dangerous, it is very important to speak with a healthcare provider if you desire to end treatment with this medication. Medical advice for this process of withdrawal can be found through certain doctors or at a prescription drug rehab. The doctor or staff in a rehab center will often decide to put the individual on a slow Diazepam taper to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Even if you have been taking this medication without a prescription, do not be afraid to ask for Diazepam withdrawal treatment, as benzodiazepine discontinuation is almost impossible to endure alone without support.Diazepam is a benzodiazepine approved for the treatment of anxiety, seizures, muscle spasms, and alcohol withdrawal. Because this drug can cause physical and psychological Diazepam addiction, it should never be suddenly discontinued. Diazepam withdrawal symptoms may include, but not limited to the following. Changes in personality, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, tingling or numbness, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), heart palpitations, memory loss, hallucinations, panic attacks, fever, seizures, headaches, tension, anxiety, depression, confusion, insomnia, sweating, irritability, and restlessness. To avoid the risks of serious withdrawal symptoms, don’t be afraid to ask for Diazepam withdrawal syndrome help; even for an individual who abuses this medication or is not prescribed to it. Symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal can turn into dangerous health risks, such as seizures.To understand why an individual encounters benzo benzodiazepine withdrawal when they stop taking benzos, let’s look at a few factors. How Diazepam works - a benzodiazepine acts in the brain by making the nerve synapse more porous to GABA, and makes it less porous to Calcium. GABA is the primary neurotransmitter that is inhibitory. It dampens the intense impulses of nerves. Use of a benzodiazepine medication causes the body system to use as much GABA as possible, but when the GABA is exhausted and all gone, everything is over-stimulating. When a person is withdrawing from this medication, it has spent all of their GABA and therefore, the body is unable to regulate stimulus. Diazepam withdrawal GABA is the body’s acute inability for dampening of nerve impulse, and every sight, noise and sensation can feel torturous. The importance of having Diazepam withdrawal help is crucial during this time.Protracted Diazepam withdrawal syndrome is when withdraw symptoms are prolonged or drawn out over an extended period of time. Protracted withdrawal is generally blamed as the drug’s fault for still leaving the persons system, or attributed to damaged receptors. However, what the person is probably experiencing is the chemical toxicity which is often what led to the initial use of this medication, and additionally now there are drug residues and damaged receptors. Such residual toxins can be still acting in the individual’s neurology as excito-toxins, and will continue to do this unless they are removed. At Alternative to Meds Center, we have found in the greater part of anxiety cases, that what the individual is suffering from is an accumulated buildup of neurotoxins including heavy toxic metals that over-stimulate the nervous system.Benzodiazepines are the most commonly addressed medications at Alternative to Meds Center, as unguided Diazepam side effects of withdrawal can be almost impossible and can present with protracted withdrawal, extreme anxiety, and seizures. We use diverse techniques for this certain class of drug, which include: a removal of collected neurotoxins that are due to use of the medication or the individuals environment, careful medication taper methods, peer support, naturally occurring substances that create neurochemical stability, and the relaxing benefits of several therapies including acupuncture sauna, meditation and massage therapy.Do you ever feel like even though you have tried every way to stop taking Diazepam or other benzos, nothing helps? Have you felt like maybe your central nervous system could be over-stimulated with neurotoxins? With most individuals, rapid benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment won’t alleviate the issue, since the anxiety remains even once the drug is gone.We know this problem very well, and have worked with one thousand people in the setting of a 24 hour residential environment. Former benzodiazepine users graduate each week at our Diazepam withdrawal treatment center. Family and friends are among the people who attend, and they are in shock at how we were able to really solve the problem, and how the participant has learned how to sustain a lifestyle which supports their newfound happiness. Please call us to find out the kind of Diazepam withdrawal help that is available for you, or a person you love. We’re here to manage this problem effectively.

Alcohol-Medication
Interactions
Many medications can
interact with alcohol, leading to increased risk of illness, injury, or death.
For example, it is estimated that alcohol-medication interactions may be a
factor in at least 25 percent of all emergency room admissions (1). An unknown
number of less serious interactions may go unrecognized or unrecorded. This
Alcohol Alert notes some of the most significant alcohol-drug interactions.
(Although alcohol can interact with illicit drugs as well, the term ""drugs""
is used here to refer exclusively to medications, whether prescription or
nonprescription.)
How Common Are
Alcohol-Drug Interactions?
More than 2,800 prescription
drugs are available in the United States, and physicians write 14 billion
prescriptions annually; in addition, approximately 2,000 medications are available
without prescription (2).
Ap proximately
70 percent of the adult population consumes alcohol at least occasionally,
and 10 percent drink daily (3). About 60 percent of men and 30 percent of
women have had one or more adverse alcohol-related life events (4). Together
with the data on medication use, these statistics suggest that some concurrent
use of alcohol and medications
is inevitable.
The elderly may
be especially likely to mix drugs and alcohol and are at particular risk for
the adverse consequences of such combinations. Although persons age 65 and
older constitute only 12 percent of the population, they consume 25 to 30
percent of all prescription medications (5) . The elderly are more likely
to suffer medication side effects compared with younger persons, and these
effects tend to be more severe with advancing age (5). Among persons age 60
or older, 10 percent of those in the community--and 40 percent of those in
nursing homes--fulfill criteria for alcohol abuse (6).
How Alcohol and
Drugs Interact
To exert its desired
effect, a drug generally must travel through the bloodstream to its site of
action, where it produces some change in an organ or tissue. The drug's effects
then diminish as it is processed (metabolized) by enzymes and eliminated from
the body. Alcohol behaves similarly, traveling through the bloodstream, acting
upon the brain to cause intoxication, and finally being metabolized and eliminated,
principally by the liver. The extent to which an administered dose of a drug
reaches its site of action may be termed its availability. Alcohol
can influence the effectiveness of a drug by altering its availability. Typical
alcohol-drug interactions include the following (7): First, an acute
dose of alcohol (a single drink or several drinks over several hours) may
inhibit a drug's metabolism by competing with the drug for the same set of
metabolizing enzymes. This interaction prolongs and enhances the drug's availability,
potentially increasing the patient's risk of experiencing harmful side effects
from the drug. Second, in contrast, chronic (long-term) alcohol ingestion
may activate drug-metabolizing enzymes, thus decreasing the drug's availability
and diminishing its effects. After these enzymes have been activated, they
remain so even in the absence of alcohol, affecting the metabolism of certain
drugs for several weeks after cessation of drinking (8). Thus, a recently
abstinent chronic drinker may need higher doses of medications than those
required by nondrinkers to achieve therapeutic levels of certain drugs. Third,
enzymes activated by chronic alcohol consumption transform some drugs into
toxic chemicals that can damage the liver or other organs. Fourth, alcohol
can magnify the inhibitory effects of sedative and narcotic drugs at their
sites of action in the brain. To add to the complexity of these interactions,
some drugs affect the metabolism of alcohol, thus altering its potential for
intoxication and the adverse effects associated with alcohol consumption (7).
Some Specific Interactions
Anesthetics.
Anesthetics are administered prior to surgery to render a patient unconscious
and insensitive to pain. Chronic alcohol consumption increases the dose of
propofol (Diprivan)1 required to induce loss of consciousness (9). Chronic
alcohol consumption increases the risk of liver damage that may be caused
by the anesthetic gases enflurane (Ethrane) (10) and halothane (Fluothane)
(11).
Antibiotics.
Antibiotics are used to treat infectious diseases. In combination with
acute alcohol consumption, some antibiotics may cause nausea, vomiting, headache,
and possibly convulsions; among these antibiotics are furazolidone (Furoxone),
griseofulvin (Grisactin and others), metronidazole (Flagyl), and the antimalarial
quinacrine (Atabrine) (7). Isoniazid and rifampin are used together to treat
tuberculosis, a disease especially problematic among the elderly (12) and
among homeless alcoholics (13). Acute alcohol consumption decreases the availability
of isoniazid in the bloodstream, whereas chronic alcohol use decreases the
availability of rifampin. In each case, the effectiveness of the medication
may be reduced (7).
Anticoagulants.
Warfarin (Coumadin) is prescribed to retard the blood's ability to clot.
Acute alcohol consumption enhances warfarin's availability, increasing the
patient's risk for life-threatening hemorrhages (7). Chronic alcohol consumption
reduces warfarin's availability, lessening the patient's protection from the
consequences of blood-clotting disorders (7).
Antidepressants.
Alcoholism and depression are frequently associated (14), leading to a high
potential for alcohol-antidepressant interactions. Alcohol increases the sedative
effect of tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil and others),
impairing mental skills required for driving (15). Acute alcohol consumption
increases the availability of some tricyclics, potentially increasing their
sedative effects (16); chronic alcohol consumption appears to increase the
availability of some tricyclics and to decrease the availability of others
(17,18). The significance of these interactions is unclear. These chronic
effects persist in recovering alcoholics (17).
A chemical called
tyramine, found in some beers and wine, interacts with some anti-depressants,
such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, to produce a dangerous rise in blood
pressure (7). As little as one standard drink may create a risk that this
interaction will occur.
Antidiabetic
medications. Oral hypoglycemic drugs are prescribed to help lower
blood sugar levels in some patients with diabetes. Acute alcohol consumption
prolongs, and chronic alcohol consumption decreases, the availability of tolbutamide
(Orinase). Alcohol also interacts with some drugs of this class to produce
symptoms of nausea and headache such as those described for metronidazole
(see ""Antibiotics"") (7).
Antihistamines.
Drugs such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl and others) are available without
prescription to treat allergic symptoms and insomnia. Alcohol may intensify
the sedation caused by some antihistamines (15). These drugs may cause excessive
dizziness and sedation in older persons; the effects of combining alcohol
and antihistamines may therefore be especially significant in this population
(19).
Antipsychotic
medications. Drugs such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) are used to
diminish psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Acute alcohol
consumption increases the sedative effect of these drugs (20), resulting in
impaired coordination and potentially fatal breathing difficulties (7). The
combination of chronic alcohol ingestion and antipsychotic drugs may result
in liver damage (21).
Antiseizure
medications. These drugs are prescribed mainly to treat epilepsy.
Acute alcohol consumption increases the availability of phenytoin (Dilantin)
and the risk of drug-related side effects. Chronic drinking may decrease phenytoin
availability, significantly reducing the patient's protection against epileptic
seizures, even during a period of abstinence (8,22).
Antiulcer
medications. The commonly prescribed antiulcer medications
cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac) increase the availability of
a low dose of alcohol under some circumstances (23,24). The clinical significance
of this finding is uncertain, since other studies have questioned such interaction
at higher doses of alcohol (25-27).
Cardiovascular
medications. This class of drugs includes a wide variety of medications
prescribed to treat ailments of the heart and circulatory system. Acute alcohol
consumption interacts with some of these drugs to cause dizziness or fainting
upon standing up. These drugs include nitroglycerin, used to treat angina,
and reserpine, methyldopa (Aldomet), hydralazine (Apresoline and others),
and guanethidine (Ismelin and others), used to treat high blood pressure.
Chronic alcohol consumption decreases the availability of propranolol (Inderal),
used to treat high blood pressure (7), potentially reducing its therapeutic
effect.
Narcotic
pain relievers. These drugs are prescribed for moderate to
severe pain. They include the opiates morphine, codeine, propoxyphene (Darvon),
and meperidine (Demerol). The combination of opiates and alcohol enhances
the sedative effect of both substances, increasing the risk of death from
overdose (28). A single dose of alcohol can increase the availability of propoxyphene
(29), potentially increasing its sedative side effects.
Nonnarcotic
pain relievers. Aspirin and similar nonprescription pain relievers
are most commonly used by the elderly (5) . Some of these drugs cause stomach
bleeding and inhibit blood from clotting; alcohol can exacerbate these effects
(30). Older persons who mix alcoholic beverages with large doses of aspirin
to self-medicate for pain are therefore at particularly high risk for episodes
of gastric bleeding (19). In addition, aspirin may increase the availability
of alcohol (31), heightening the effects of a given dose of alcohol.
Chronic alcohol
ingestion activates enzymes that transform acetaminophen (Tylenol and others)
into chemicals that can cause liver damage, even when acetaminophen is used
in standard therapeutic amounts (32,33). These effects may occur with as little
as 2.6 grams of acetaminophen in persons consuming widely varying amounts
of alcohol (34).
Sedatives
and hypnotics (""sleeping pills""). Benzodiazepines such as diazepam
(Valium) are generally prescribed to treat anxiety and insomnia. Because of
their greater safety margin, they have largely replaced the barbiturates,
now used mostly in the emergency treatment of convulsions (2).
Doses of benzodiazepines
that are excessively sedating may cause severe drowsiness in the presence
of alcohol (35), increasing the risk of household and automotive accidents
(15,36). This may be especially true in older people, who demonstrate an increased
response to these drugs (5,19). Low doses of flurazepam (Dalmane) interact
with low doses of alcohol to impair driving ability, even when alcohol is
ingested the morning after taking Dalmane. Since alcoholics often suffer from
anxiety and insomnia, and since many of them take morning drinks, this interaction
may be dangerous (37).
The benzodiazepine
lorazepam (Ativan) is being increasingly used for its antianxiety and sedative
effects. The combination of alcohol and lorazepam may result in depressed
heart and breathing functions; therefore, lorazepam should not be administered
to intoxicated patients (38).
Acute alcohol consumption
increases the availability of barbiturates, prolonging their sedative effect.
Chronic alcohol consumption decreases barbiturate availability through enzyme
activation (2). In addition, acute or chronic alcohol consumption enhances
the sedative effect of barbiturates at their site of action in the brain,
sometimes leading to coma or fatal respiratory depression (39).
Alcohol-Medication
Interactions--A Commentary by
NIAAA Director Enoch Gordis, M.D.
Individuals who drink
alcoholic beverages should be aware that simultaneous use of alcohol and medications--both
prescribed and over-the-counter--has the potential to cause problems. For
example, even very small doses of alcohol probably should not be used with
antihistamines and other medications with sedative effects. Individuals who
drink larger amounts of alcohol may run into problems when commonly used medications
(e.g., acetaminophen) are taken at the same time or even shortly after drinking
has stopped. Elderly individuals should be especially careful of these potential
problems due to their generally greater reliance on multiple medications and
age-related changes in physiology.

Mother’s Little Helper: The Rise and fall of Valium
Tuesday, December 8th, 2009
The Creation of Valium aka Diazepam. Forty-Six years ago, Dr. Leo Sternbach of Hoffmann-Le Roche made his second benzodiazepine which was twice as potent as his first creation, Librium or chlordiazepoxide. This drug has propelled him to pharmaceutical giant status and became the top selling mild sedative in the United States from 1969-1982. It reached its peak in sales in 1978 with Americans popping in 2.3 billion tablets in that year alone. It found its place in pop culture through Rolling Stone’s 1960’s hit “Mother’s Little Helper”.
Who could forget that tragic housewife plagued with addiction to this drug in this unforgettable hit single? Until the introduction of other shorter-acting, non-addictive drugs in the market, valium enjoyed its popularity for more than two decades as the leading cure for anxiety. To Buy Valium Online Click Here.
During its peak, the media abound with news of its rampant abuse. Its increasing notoriety coupled with the creation of other faster acting non-addictive sedatives like anxyolotics, Valium fell to the 4th rank as America’s most popular drug. Added to that, reports of the link between the drug’s use and the development of cancer cells contributed further to its waning popularity. Despite this, mother’s little helper still enjoys unsurpassed fame in other parts of the globe. In Australia, valium represents 82% of the benzodiazepine market along with three other drugs of this kind. In the United Kingdom, the shortage of heroine has opted drug users to turn to diazepam to ease their cocaine crackdown.
A quote about mothers little helper, valium by the rolling stones;
“She goes running for the shelter of a mother’s little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day…”
Mother’s Little Helper, The Rolling Stones

Generic Valium (Diazepam) Now For Pets
Monday, November 30th, 2009
Even Kitty and Rover can benefit from the calming effects of Valium or Diazepam. Diazepam, one of the most prescribed benzodiazepines or mild sedatives by doctors can also be prescribed by vets for treatment of anxiety and behavioral problems, relieve epileptic convulsions and also for appetite stimulation. Benzodiazepines are also called Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants since they work directly on the brain. Although the precise mechanism of action is not exactly known, specific benzodiazepines receptors are found in the brain as well as lungs, heart and kidneys. Buy Valium Online (more…)

Taking Valium with Other Medication
Thursday, November 19th, 2009
When prescribed with valium, always warn your doctor that you’re also taking other medications. Some medicines may interact with valium and more often than not, it may have some adverse effects. Always inform your health care provider if you are regularly taking these medications:
Drugs that make you drowsy or sleepy (cough medicine, narcotic pain killers, downers like other sedatives, sleeping pills, muscle relaxers and medicine for depression, convulsions or anxiety). This could double the sleepiness caused when you buy diazepam.
Hydantoins, rifamycins or St. John’s Wort because they might decrease the effectiveness of valium. Some examples of these drugs are phenytoin (for hydantoins), and rifampins (for rifamycins).
Ketoconazole (anti fungal), barbiturates like amobarbital, butabarbital mephobarbital, secobarbital or Phenobarbital; antibiotics.
MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), disulfram, phenothiazines, or other medicines for mood problems as they may also increase the risk of other diazepam side effects.
Medications for treatment of psychiatric disorders like aripiprazole and chlorpromazine
Hydantoins like phenytoin.
There are a lot more substances that may reduce effectiveness or increase the adverse side effects of diazepam when combined with this drug. Your health care provider may be able to provide you with a list of medications that may not go well with diazepam so do check with your doctor or physician before starting with this medication.

When To Avoid Using Valium ( Diazepam )
Monday, November 16th, 2009
Taking valium or diazepam may be habit forming and this should be prescribed by a doctor or a physician. This should not be shared with another person especially with someone who has a history of substance abuse or addiction. Keep it in a secure place out of reach of children or where others cannot get to it. Before you order cheap Valium online, find a place in your home to safely store the drug.
Valium should not be used when:
• You are allergic to diazepam. That is why it is advisable to consult a doctor before taking this drug.
• You have myasthenia gravis. **
• You have narrow angle glaucoma.
• You are pregnant or lactating. Valium can cause birth defects. Also, this drug can also pass into breast milk and can harm your baby.
• Severe liver or kidney disease since this is metabolized in the liver.
• You have sleep apnea or difficulty breathing during sleep.
• You are taking ritonavir or other HIV portease inhibitors or sodium oxybate.
• Bipolar Personality
** This is a neuromuscular disease leading to fatigue and fluctuating levels of muscular weakness. It is caused by selective overactivity of the body’s immune system in which a patient produces antibodies against a particular target in his or her own body. It is characterized by painless weakness of voluntary muscles which gets worse with repeated use of the muscle or body part. Symptoms fluctuate or usually get worse by the end of the day, during hot weather or post infection. In women, it usually happens during or before period.
Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Always consult a doctor before you buy diazepam or buy any other drug for that matter.

How Does Valium Affect Gaba Levels
Saturday, November 14th, 2009
Valium, which is also known as Diazepam, was first approved for use in 1960. It was developed by Dr. Leo Sternbach of Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and it’s primarily used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders, along with certain disorders of the nervous system, and to relieve withdrawal symptoms from alcohol and opiates. It’s one of a set of drugs known as benzodiazepines, It is known to have a strong sedative effect, similar to Barbiturates, but less extreme, and somewhat safer. It was the top selling drug in the US from 1969 to 1982.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (Also known as GABA) has sometimes been called the body’s natural tranquilizer. GABA’s function is to block communication between different brain cells, and calm nerve impulses. Raising the levels of GABA slows down the brains activity, and lowering it speeds up brain activity, leading to nervousness and anxiety. Before opting to buy Valium, understand it works by targeting the receptors for GABA, almost functioning as a synthetic replacement for the brain chemical. Alcohol and Barbiturates also work by either simulating GABA, or raising the levels of the chemical, and there are many other drugs that have since been developed that do the same thing.
The effects on the body of raised GABA levels are basically identical to the effects of Valium and other depressants. It tends to calm and relax people, and depending on the dosage, it often makes people drowsy. Overdose can cause mental confusion, and impaired motor function. In more extreme cases, it can even cause coma or death. Valium can be addictive if taken for a long period of time, and abuse of the drug is a very common problem. People who abuseValium over a long period of time suffer extreme withdrawal symptoms when they stop, including convulsions. A gradual process of slowly decreasing doses is the recommended method of coming off the drug.

How does Generic Valium stack up against Brand Name?
Tuesday, September 8th, 2009
Nowadays, drug manufacturers make generic medicines available so they are more reasonable to individuals who cannot afford the brand name drug. At times, government intervention steps in to require these pharmaceutical companies to offer generic forms. Other times, these companies make them available when the original brand name drug is created and brought to market. Generics, in order to be approved for consumption, must be proven to be safe and provide the same level of effectiveness as their parent brand name form of the drug.
Valium, or Diazepam for the generic form, is a drug prescribed for anxiety and/or panic attacks. Many individuals rely on this medication to make it through a day without getting uncomfortable or even debilitating anxiety and panic. Individuals who skip doses can experience severe anxiety or panic that can be both dangerous and uncomfortable. Diazepam, the generic form of Valium, is just as effective as the brand name Valium but costs much less.
Not everyone can afford to buy drugs from a doctor, which is why thousands of people buy cheap valium from india. In most cases, if the doctor fails to write the prescription for Diazepam and writes it for Valium, the pharmacy will not be able to give the individual a generic. Rather than be bothered with the hassle of scheduling, visiting, and begging for prescriptions many people have chosen to buy online.
Diazepam is the most popular generic equivalent of Valium. There are, however, other generic forms of Valium but none have as good of a reputation as Diazepam does. Other makers located in China, Mexico, Asia, and India are said to be less reputable and some say it is dangerous to try these ill-established forms of Valium because you never really know what you are getting. Because buying Diazepam has grown in popularity rapidly, and is made of the same exact substance as brand name Valium, it is the only safe generic alternative.
Not only is Diazepam safe because it is made from the same thing as Valium and has been around for years, it is way cheaper. The range one would pay for brand name Valium, for a 90-day supply, is anywhere from $300-$400, while Diazepam will run an individual anywhere from $15-$30. Diazepam is approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).

Herbal Extracts vs Prescription Drugs For Anxiety
Tuesday, September 1st, 2009
The most potent, and popular anxiety treating medication in America is Xanax. Xanax is a benzodiazepine, this class of drugs is responsible for slowing nervous system functions to normal speed in anxious people. Xanax has a stigma attached to it, along with all other prescription drugs. It has become a joke, that treating one disorder leads to 10 new problems that also need treatment.
Some of the news we publish here at NPDrugs is biased towards the motive of the article writer. This article in peticular is biased towards herbal supplements and other natural anxiety agents. These “natural cures” are useful to a small number of people, the majority however continue to buy valium, xanax, and similar drugs for proven relief. Always read opinionated, and suggestive content with a skeptics eye.
The side-effects aside, Xanax is the fastest acting anxiety drug available and can calm a panic attack in a matter of 10 minutes. Some herbal drugs claim to do the same, and they work just as effectively. SO why would anyone buy xanax online, if they can buy herbal anxiety drugs cheaper? It comes down to programming and the degree of the disorder being treated. Someone experiencing mild panic attacks may opt for natural cures to save money and avoid addiction. But another person may suffer extreme panic attacks, and opt to buy Xanax because it is proven in clinical trials. Some families are raised to take drugs all their life, while others parents wont even give them nyquil to get a good nights sleep.
Another one of the popular and powerful anxiety drugs is Valium which has been on the market now for a very long time. These drugs should never be taken with alcohol as they may cause even more problems and they may also induce even more anxiety and drowsiness so that driving a car may well be dangerous. A natural anti anxiety medicine which uses herbs is ideal for the average mildly anxious person, and it has he same treatment ability as a small dose of Xanax or Valium you can buy here. As always, research everything yourself. Should you choose to buy anything online, make sure you have read about the product and its safe for you to ingest.

Inventor Of Valium Dies At Age 97
Friday, August 28th, 2009
Leo Sternbach, the inventor of a revolutionary new class of tranquilizers that included Valium, one of the first blockbuster “lifestyle” drugs, has died at his home in North Carolina. He was 97.
Sternbach, an award-winning chemist who helped the Swiss drug conglomerate Roche Group build its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, after fleeing the Nazis during World War II, died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, after a short illness late Wednesday. His wife, sons and other relatives were at his side, according to the company.
It is a sad day when such an influential and successful scientist passes away. Leo Sternbach gave the world back some of the peace it once had with his prescription drug Valium. Buy Valium Online now and experience what Leo gave the world.
Valium owes its success to the stubborn streak of chemist Leo Sternbach, who refused to quit after his boss at Hoffmann-La Roche ended a project to develop a tranquilizer to compete with a rival company’s drug. Sternbach tested one last version and in just a day, he got the results: The compound made animals relaxed and limp.
Sternbach had made the discovery that eventually led to Valium. It was approved for use in 1963 and became the country’s most prescribed drug from 1969 to 1982. Roche sold nearly 2.3 billion Valium pills stamped with the trademark “V” at the drug’s 1978 peak.
“It gave you a feeling of well-being,” Sternbach told The Associated Press in a 2003 interview on the 40th anniversary of Valium. “Only when the sales figures came in, then I realized how important it was.”
Named one of the 25 most influential Americans of the 20th century by U.S. News & World Report, Sternbach’s credits include 241 patents, 122 publications, honorary degrees and other awards. As recently as 1994, Roche products for which Sternbach held patents brought in more than one-quarter of the company’s worldwide pharmaceutical revenues.

Anxiety Over Medicare Benzo Ban
Thursday, August 27th, 2009
When the federal government’s new prescription drug benefit kicks in next year, it will not cover a category of drugs commonly used to treat anxiety, insomnia and seizures. That means those disabled and elderly people on Medicare who take Xanax, Valium, Ativan and other types of the drug benzodiazepine will have to look elsewhere for coverage or switch to a different, less addictive medication.
Because the New Drug Benefit Program wont cover the most common benzos, its a good idea to buy your drugs online. Generally people buy ambien, xanax, and buy valium online.
Finding other alternatives may not be easy for the 1.7 million low-income, elderly people who take the drug and will be automatically enrolled in the new prescription drug plan. They will depend on the states to continue paying for their benzodiazepines — “benzos” for short — on Jan. 1, but with no guarantee.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently urged state Medicaid directors to provide coverage of the drugs for the 6.3 million people who are “duel eligible” for prescription aid under the Medicaid and Medicare programs. If states agree, they will continue to get federal matching funds when they pay for benzos.
But concerns remain among medical professionals and advocates for the elderly about what would happen if some states opt to save money by excluding benzos from their Medicaid program for the poor. “Stopping the therapy abruptly can lead to seizures and dangerous, life-threatening problems,” said Thomas Clark, policy director for the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists.

Benzodiazepines Proven Effective For Alcohol Withdrawl
Thursday, August 6th, 2009
While we all know that alcohol intoxication can cause people to do some pretty bizarre things, such as jumping from balconies to dancing wildly, when in fact alcohol actually has a depressant effect on the neurons in the brain. This means that neurons are less likely to “fire” and overall brain activity is decreased. A problem arises when a person v to withdrawal from alcohol such that the neurons which have been suppressed go into overdrive and start to fire more than they normally would, resulting in increased brain activity. This increased brain activity, seen during alcohol withdrawal, may even lead to seizures and hallucinations.
Buy Valium, Xanax, & Ambien Online
Benzodiazepines have a similar effect on the brain in that they induce depression of the nervous system similar to alcohol, as these substances are both known as depressants. Currently, benzodiazepines are the first line medication for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which may include rapid heart rate, confusion, hallucinations, as well as seizures and the more serious delirium tremens. Studies, such as one completed at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine, show that benzodiazepines are more effective than placebo in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, benzodiazepines are not without their own risks, one of which is addiction.
Benzodiazepines, such as valium, have been used for decades for the treatment of disorders such as anxiety and insomnia. However, when used for extended amounts of time, patients often become addicted to this class of medications. New research indicates that benzodiazepine trigger the same dopamine reward system that cocaine affects to produce a strong addictive effect. Eventually researchers may search for an alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and delirium tremens. Currently, benzodiazepines are used in emergency rooms and detoxification centers nationwide to treat alcohol withdraw patients. However, as patients in detoxification are weaned from alcohol, some researchers worry that they be trading one powerfully addictive drug for another, as alcohol is known to affect the same dopamine reward system that benzodiazepines act on.
As the addictive potential of benzodiazepines is more thoroughly researched, physicians might become less likely to prescribe these medications to patients with anxiety and insomnia as SSRIS, or selective serotonin inhibitors, are a reasonable alternative to benzodiazepines for many of the psychiatric conditions that benzodiazepines are currently prescribed for.

Contributing co-author: Andrew Chen
Alcohol withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant (see here for an overview). Symptoms vary from person to person, but most people will experience some negative symptoms of alcohol withdrawal if they try to stop drinking after long term use.
Mild to moderate symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, rapid heart rate, abnormal movements, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include hallucinations, fever, and convulsions (known as DT’s or delirium tremens). Most people undergoing alcohol detox do not require hospitalization, but in severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary (1). Since their introduction in the 1960s, benzodiazepines have been the drug of choice for treating severe cases of alcohol withdrawal.
Benzodiazepines, or benzos for short, are a class of psychoactive drugs that work to slow down the central nervous system by activating GABA receptors. This provides a variety of useful tranquilizing effects. Aside from relieving symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepines are also commonly prescribed to treat insomnia, muscle spasms, involuntary movement disorders, anxiety disorders, and convulsive disorders.
The most common regimen for treating alcohol withdrawal includes 3 days of long-acting benzodiazepines on a fixed schedule with additional medication available “as needed.” (2)
The two most commonly prescribed benzos are chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) is preferred for its superior anticonvulsant capabilities while diazepam (Valium) is preferred for its safety against overdose with alcohol. Short-acting benzos like oxazepam and lorazepam are less frequently used for treating alcohol withdrawal (1).
Compared to other drugs, benzos are the safest and most effective method for treating difficult alcohol withdrawal. However, benzodiazepines do come with their own potential for dependence and abuse. Ironically, symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal are quite similar to those of alcohol withdrawal. Tapering off dosage is the best way to prevent serious withdrawal symptoms. To avoid such complications, benzodiazepines are only recommended for short-term treatment of alcohol withdrawal.
In short
Benzos can be very useful for helping long terms alcoholics deal with the difficult withdrawal symptoms that can accompany the detox period. Just be mindful so as not to find yourself right back where you started.

Heavy alcohol users Vs. Addicts – Stress response
January 4th, 2012
I can’t even count how many times I’ve talked about the difference between alcohol or drug users and alcoholics or addicts (see here, here, and here for some examples and keep reading). The quick summary: Many people use drugs and many abuse them at times, a small percentage meet criteria for addiction at some point in their life and an even smaller percentage is the type of addict we’ve been taught to think of – chronically relapsing and seemingly incapable of quitting no matter how crappy their life gets.
One of the main reasons we study drug and alcohol abuse is because of the huge health impact of this stuff – we spend billions and billions of dollars every year on health-care that is directly or indirectly related to the abuse of nicotine, alcohol, and pretty much every other drug on earth (marijuana can certainly help some conditions but heavy use of marijuana can bring its own consequences). One of the major players in these health problems is the effect of alcohol and drug use on stress in the body. Stress increases death rates in several ways including: Heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and more.
Well, a recent study in Amsterdam looked at alcohol (yes, you read that right, the Dutch care about more than weed) consumption, alcohol addiction (alcoholism) diagnosis, and effects on the body’s stress system, also known as the HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) Axis. If nothing else, the study helped confirm that an alcoholism diagnosis is not necessarily the same as an indication of heavy drinking and that excessive drinking is no bueno, regardless of whether it meets addiction criteria or not.
Alcohol drinking, alcoholism, and stress regulation
I’m not going to go into this in detail (look here and here for more) but just as our brains and bodies have systems for decision making, they also have complex stress management systems. The latter rely heavily on hormones, including Cortisol, to keep our bodies in the right states whether those be fight, flight, or reading a book before sleep (see figure on left for over-simplified cortisol levels throughout the day in a normal person). We’re supposed to have the most cortisol right upon waking with constant reductions throughout the day until we fall asleep, and back again. Individuals with mental health disorders like anxiety and depression have substantially different cortisol level patterns throughout the day and are less effective at regulating cortisol (in case you needed another reason why our biology affects our states of being and behavior).
The dutch study tested cortisol levels at 7 different times throughout the day after giving their subjects a 4 hour battery of tests. They also assessed their cardiac functioning by assessing different measures related to heart beat regulation that allows for adapting across challenging situations by affecting the sympathetic nervous system (excitatory processes) and parasympathetic nervous system (inhibitory processes).
They looked at these measures as a way of assessing the relative functioning of the HPA Axes’ of different groups. Specifically, they looked at:
Non-drinkers
Moderate drinkers (less than 3 drinks per day)
Heavy drinkers (more than 3 drinks per day)
Non alcoholics
Remitted alcoholics (met criteria for alcoholism previously but not in past 12 months)
Current alcoholics.
One of the most interesting findings, as far as I’m concerned, was that among remitted alcoholics the average amount of drinking was around 1.3 drinks per day with a lot of variability, a little higher than that of moderate drinkers (0.8 drinks per day) but lower than that of heavy drinkers (4.0 drinks per day). I see this as a little more proof that people who met criteria for alcoholism at one point don’t necessarily abstain forever and don’t necessarily continue to have drinking problems (per Moderation Management, spontaneous remission, or some other means of stopping their alcoholic drinking).*
You can blame improper diagnostic criteria, a continuum of addiction severity, or anything else as far as I’m concerned but as I pointed out in my first paragraph, we’ve talked about this topic repeatedly and I see no end coming soon. The bottom line is that meeting criteria for alcoholism at one point in life tells me something, but far from everything, about a person’s drinking habits or drinking problems later in life.
But back to stress. As you might have already guessed, since it is heavy drinking that causes serious dysregulation of the body’s stress response, what the researchers found was that meeting criteria for alcoholism now, or in the past, didn’t have any major effect over their participants’ HPA functioning. Instead, all that mattered was how heavy their drinking was now. Heavy drinkers had higher waking cortisol levels, higher night-time cortisol, and increased sympathetic (excitatory) control. In short – heavy drinkers were less able to regulate their stress and excitation response, likely leading to increased stress on their bodies.
As a side note, this study also found that if anything, moderate drinking conferred health benefits when it came to stress over not-drinking at all – far from the first study to note this but another set of reinforcing evidence that drinking alcohol is not in itself bad for you while over-drinking is.
So – Drinking a lot of alcohol causes disruptions to your body’s stress regulation system that will likely increase the likelihood of heart problems, depression, anxiety, and more. Those disruptions are there whether you meet criteria for alcoholism or not.
Obviously, there are many alcoholics who drink a lot of alcohol, but there are also people who meet (now or in the past) criteria for alcoholism who are binge drinkers and therefore don’t drink daily and have lower “drink numbers.” As we mentioned before, addiction is not about quantity, in fact, the criteria for addiction barely mentions quantity – when it states that addicts consume “more than intended” or that tolerance creates a state where an person needs greater quantity to reach the same effect of the drug. Drinking or using a lot of drugs or alcohol does not an addict make.
*Note: Given the variability in the remitted-alcoholics groups their is little doubt that some of them had stopped drinking while others drank to excess. Additionally, it should be pointed out that alcohol abuse was not assessed in this sample, so it could still be a problem for at least some of those now-drinking past-alcoholics.

Are violent drunks giving the rest of us a bad name? Alcohol consumption and violence
December 8th, 2011
We all know that drinking alcohol changes the way people think and can make them act strangely right? We also know that alcohol is involved in more than 50% of violent crimes and about 75% of partner violence. The question is, why the connection?
A recent paper I published suggests that drugs and alcohol can not themselves be thought to cause violence. Still, the relationship exists, so what gives?
(Before you go any further, if you’re unclear about the difference between causation and association, I suggest you read this article)
Your brain and alcohol abuse
The thought altering effects of consuming alcohol, and most drugs, can be said to affect something called executive functioning (EF). What exactly makes up this type of functioning is a source of some debate, but let’s just say that it refers to attention, strategic planning, reasoning, thought flexibility, and the ability to process information in working memory (an important type of memory used in learning).
You can probably already tell that this type of brain function is extremely important and that different people possess different levels of it. I can also tell you that alcohol consumption has been shown to reduce overall executive functioning. If you drink alcohol, or have ever seen someone drink, this probably doesn’t come as a huge surprise.
The thing is that alcohol consumption messes up everyone’s EF, though obviously, the more you drink, the more affected you become. Still, given the fact that more than 50% of Americans report at least one binge drinking episode a year and less than 7% are involved in violent crime, something else must be at play, right?
Aggressive personality and irritability
As I mentioned earlier, I published a paper showing that aggressive personality, which I measured using 5 different tests, contributes far more to violent behavior than drug use alone. Still, a recent study found that irritability alone could account for some aggressive behavior. Still, the more interesting finding had to do with alcohol-related EF problems and irritability together. The experiment was pretty interesting, so let’s go over it for a bit.
Researchers at the University of Kentucky took more than 300 students and gave them a whole bunch of tests assessing their EF and their overall level of irritability. Afterward, half of the students were given alcohol to drink (about 3-4 drinks per person) and the other half was given a similar number of drinks that contained no alcohol but were sprayed before being handed to smell the same. The students were then asked to play a game that pitted them against another person. The secret was that there was no game and no other person, the winner and loser in each round was pre-determined. Every time the student “won” they got to give the other player a shock, but every time they lost, they themselves got shocked. As the game went on, the shocks the participants got increased in intensity. The researchers wanted to see how the students would react and how large the shocks they would give back would be.
The results showed that the more mistakes people made in their initial EF testing (and therefore the less overall EF capability they showed) the more aggressive they were. This makes sense, as people who are less able to plan, think ahead, and control their behavior would be more likely to engage in things that would hurt them, or misjudge events and think react inappropriately. Irritability was also shown to affect aggression, but this time only for men and intoxicated women.
The effect of alcohol abuse on aggression and violence
When the whole thing was put together the researchers found that for drunk men only, reduced EF and increased irritability worked together to generate even more aggression that was shown for all the other participants. For the simplest example think back to anyone you know who is pretty quick to react anyway and is a little too easily pissed-off. Chances are they become a pretty mean drunk who likes to get in fights.
Obviously this makes sense if you know someone like that, but in terms of helping us make decisions about who should be considered dangerous and who shouldn’t, especially when consuming alcohol, this research helps further explain why we see such a strong connection between alcohol abuse and violence or aggression.
The way I see it there’s a relatively small number of people (mostly men) who is normally pretty aggressive, irritable, and lacking in judgment and self-control, who often get violent when they drink alcohol. For them, many alcohol drinking episodes end badly, and since they’re the most visible of the aggressive drinkers, their behavior produces an association between alcohol consumption per se and violence. For the rest of us, alcohol consumption rarely leads to violence, but violence rarely occurs without drinking alcohol either, so we hardly ever enter the equation at all. That’s why the pattern holds.

Influential factors in college drinking
October 19th, 2011
Co-authored by: Jamie Felzer
What influences college students’ decisions about whether to drink and how much?
Do friends peer pressure them?
Do they do it because they are bored?
Do they drink to relieve depression or anxiety?
Researchers recently tried to answer these questions by surveying college students…
65% of the participants reported having at least one drink in the past three months. It was astonishing that the typical number of drinks in a week was 10.5 and on a weekend was 7.3 average drinks. These numbers included drinkers and nondrinkers and was the average (meaning around half the people had more drinks as those had less). This indicates that college drinking is far more extreme than drinking happening outside of the college setting.
3 main influential factors for someone’s decisions in college drinking and to what extent:
If their close friends were drinking,
How drunk they thought they were, and
Their drinking intentions.
Interestingly enough, the more students thought others on their campus approved of drinking, the less they tended to drink. We recently reported similar misconceptions about students, their peers and marijuana use. Typically, if people intend to get drunk they use less protective factors (see here for a previous post about these) such as pacing or eating or keeping track of what they were drinking. Friends’ drinking was the best predictor of drinking habits in all cases.
You can tell a lot about a person by watching their friends, so watch who you surround yourself with. Those who think favorably of drinking tend to think they can drink more before reaching intoxication and also tend to hang out with others who do the same. However, these people are the ones that need the most intervention yet are the most difficult to change.
Those who socialize with a wide variety of people typically are lighter drinkers and tend to respond better to treatment immediately as well as have fewer problems further down the line. The heavier drinkers benefit more from motivational interventions focusing on their attitudes toward drinking.
Regardless of stereotypes, ethnicity, weight and gender did have an effect on any of these findings. It was peoples’ closest friends that were the most significant factor in influencing all aspects of college drinking.

Addiction stories: How I recovered from my addiction to crystal meth
October 15th, 2011
By the time I was done with my addiction to crystal meth, I had racked up 4 arrests, 9 felonies, a $750,000 bail, a year in jail, and an eight year suspended sentence to go along with my 5 year probation period. Though I think education is important to keep getting the message out about addiction and drug abuse, there is no doubt that addiction stories do a great job of getting the message across, so here goes.
My crystal meth addiction story
The kid my parents knew was going nowhere, and fast. That’s why I was surprised when they came to my rescue after 3 years of barely speaking to them. My lawyer recommended that I check into a rehab facility immediately; treating my drug abuse problem was our only line of legal defense.
I had long known that I had an addiction problem when I first checked myself into rehab. Still, my reason for going in was my legal trouble. Within 3 months, I was using crystal meth again, but the difference was that this time, I felt bad about it. I had changed in those first three months. The daily discussions in the addiction treatment facility, my growing relationship with my parents, and a few sober months (more sobriety than I had in years) were doing their job. I relapsed as soon as I went back to work in my studio, which was a big trigger for me, but using wasn’t any fun this time.
I ended up being kicked out of that facility for providing a meth-positive urine test. My parents were irate. I felt ashamed though I began using daily immediately. My real lesson came when I dragged myself from my friend’s couch to an AA meeting one night. I walked by a homeless man who was clearly high when the realization hit me:
I was one step away from becoming like this man.
You see, when I was in the throes of my crystal meth addiction, I had money because I was selling drugs. I had a great car, a motorcycle, an apartment and my own recording studio. After my arrest though, all of that had been taken away. I just made matters worse by getting myself thrown out of what was serving as my home, leaving myself to sleep on a friend’s couch for the foreseeable future.
Something had to change.
I woke up the next morning, smoked some meth, and drove straight to an outpatient drug program offered by my health insurance. I missed the check-in time for that day, but I was told to come back the next morning, which I did. I talked to a counselor, explained my situation, and was given a list of sober-living homes to check out.
As I did this, I kept going to the program’s outpatient meetings, high on crystal meth, but ready to make a change. I was going to do anything I could so as not to end up homeless, or a lifetime prisoner. I had no idea how to stop doing the one thing that had been constant in my life since the age of 15, but I was determined to find out.
When I showed up at the sober-living facility that was to be the place where I got sober, I was so high I couldn’t face the intake staff. I wore sunglasses indoors at 6 PM. My bags were searched, I was shown to my room, and the rest of my life began.
I wasn’t happy to be sober, but I was happier doing what these people told me than I was fighting the cops, the legal system, and the drugs. I had quite a few missteps, but I took my punishments without a word, knowing they were nothing compared to the suffering I’d experience if I left that place.
Overall, I have one message to those struggling with getting clean:
If you want to get past the hump of knowing you have a problem but not knowing what to do about it, the choice has to be made clear. This can’t be a game of subtle changes. No one wants to stop using if the alternative doesn’t seem a whole lot better. For most of us, that means hitting a bottom so low that I can’t be ignored. You get to make the choice of what the bottom will be for you.
You don’t have to almost die, but you might; losing a job could be enough, but if you miss that sign, the next could be the streets; losing your spouse will sometimes do it, but if not, losing your shared custody will hurt even more.
At each one of these steps, you get to make a choice – Do I want things to get worse or not?
Ask yourself that question while looking at the price you’ve paid up to now. If you’re willing to go even lower for that next hit, I say go for it. If you think you want to stop but can’t seem to really grasp just how far you’ve gone, get a friend you trust, a non-using friend, and have them tell you how they see the path your life has taken.
It’s going to take a fight to get out, but if I beat my addiction, you can beat yours.
By now, I’ve received my Ph.D. from UCLA, one of the top universities in the world. I study addiction research, and publish this addiction blog along with a Psychology Today column and a number of academic journals. I also have my mind set on changing the way our society deals with drug abuse and addiction. Given everything I’ve accomplished by now, the choice should have seemed clear before my arrest – but it wasn’t. I hope that by sharing addiction stories, including mine, we can start that process.

More money more problems? Rich teens and drugs
September 7th, 2011
Teens raised in affluent homes display the highest rates of depression, anxiety, and drug abuse according to a recent article in Monitor on Psychology, the APA‘s monthly magazine.
One of our recent posts dealt with some of the issues unique to teens and drugs. In addition to the issues we’d already mentioned, the article named a number of reasons for the high prevalence of mental-health issues among affluent teens. Among them were an increasingly narcissistic society, overbearing parents, and an common attitude of perfectionism.
Each of these reasons are likely contributors to the prevalence of mental health and drug abuse issues among upper-middle-class (and above) teens. Still, as far as I’m concerned, the main take home message of the article is this:
Money truly doesn’t buy happiness – Rich teens and drug use.
While drug abuse research often focuses on the lower socioeconomic strata these recent findings indicate that being financially stable offers little in the way of protection from some of the most common psychological difficulties.
Thankfully, the researchers cited in the article gave some simple advice to parents:
Give children clear responsibilities to help around the house.
Take part in community service (to unite the family and reduce narcissism).
Reduce TV watching (especially of reality TV shows that glorify celebrity and excess).
Monitor internet use.
Stop obsessing about perfect grades and focus instead on the joy of learning for its own sake.
I couldn’t agree more with these recommendations. Having taught a number of classes myself, I have witnessed the ridiculous inflation in students’ expectations of top grades. I think it’s time we turned attention back to the family and reintroduce some of the basic skills that many addicts find themselves learning much too late… Often in recovery.

Higher drug abuse among gay youth likely tied to rejection
July 17th, 2011
For a lesbian, gay, or bisexual youth, “coming out” is an extremely stressful, though important event that can result in improved self-esteem, social-support, and psychological adjustment.
However, a recent study found that the reactions to such a disclosure have a lot to do with the risk of those youths abusing alcohol and drugs.
Social rejection and drug abuse among gay youth
The results revealed that the more rejecting reactions a youth receives, the more likely they are to engage in drug abuse including alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use. This was true even after researchers controlled for a number of other important variables like emotional distress and demographics (race, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, etc.).
This makes a lot of sense. After finally deciding to go through with such a monumental disclosure, harsh rejections likely cause some serious damage to a youth’s self-esteem, making escape by drugs an attractive option. Although coming out can eventually lead to increased self-esteem even for this youth, the road there is not an easy one.
The good news was that accepting reactions seemed to protect youths from the harmful effects of being rejected – Social support helps!
The researchers suggested that drug abuse prevention attempts with LGBT youths address the impact of rejecting reactions to sexual-orientation disclosure directly in order to hopefully reduce their negative impact.
Here’s a video about the difficulties of coming out in high-school:

How to Stop Abusing Alcohol and Cope with the Symptoms of Withdrawal
By Anne Ahira
If you or someone you love has a problem with alcohol abuse or dependency and has a strong desire to stop drinking, you will find the tips and advice in this medical guide extremely beneficial in getting you or your loved one started on the road to recovery.
In some cases it is possible for an individual to cease their alcohol consumption on their own however, in some individuals with the progressive disease called alcoholism they will need outside help such as a physician to help with the symptoms of withdrawal or a support group such as ""AA"" or ""Alcoholics Anonymous"".
One of the first steps you should take is to compose a list of all the negative effects that you have suffered in your life due to your alcohol consumption and keep this with you at all times as reminder of why you want to stop. You should look at it frequently and especially when you feel the desire to have a drink.
You should also inform all of your close friends and family members of your plan to discontinue your alcohol usage and advise them of how they can be of help in supporting you with your decision. You should also avoid any situation that will tempt you into consuming alcohol such as social situations and environments where alcohol is prevalent.
Joining a self-help group in your area can also be very beneficial to you as you will be among people facing the same issues as yourself when in comes to alcohol dependency. One of the hardest things among individuals who consume alcohol regularly or excessively are the withdrawal symptoms that can be experienced physically when alcohol usage is abruptly stopped.
These symptoms can be from mild to severe such as, sweating profusely, vomiting, shaking, and extreme headaches. These symptoms can be alleviated with a prescription from your doctor who may also prescribe medications to be used after withdrawal which will help you in maintaining your sobriety.

View Full Version : Benzos-- Just say NO!
Lia~~12-20-2007, 04:54 PMBenzodiazepines--NOT the drug of choice for alcoholics.
Benzodiazepines (valium, xanax, antivan, clonopin, librium) are the among the most commonly prescribed depressant medications in the US. Their benefits in short term treatment of acute anxiety disorder cannot be denied-- however their risks far outweigh the benefits for persons with alcoholism.
Drugs with longer half lives (librium, clonopin) are often prescribed for short term management of detox-- under careful HCP supervision. When prescribed and used appropriately, these drugs can be very helpful in short term detox-- however the use of benzos for long term management of anxiety/insomnia is not recommended in alcoholics. They often become a substitute addiction-- and the physical addiction is very hard to overcome.
The use of the shorter half-life drugs are NOT generally indicated. Their short half lives, (especially xanax and valium) make them of little use for detox and their high abuse potential makes them contraindicated in alcoholism-- you may see them prescribed for short term control of SEVERE (seizure/hypertension) withdrawal but that is usually reserved for inpatient use (if the doc KNOWS you are alcoholic and understands addiction). Benzos are highly addictive and the withdrawal is worse than heroin.
It is important to TELL you HCP you are an alcoholic before accepting any prescription. While withdrawal from alcohol is hard, withdrawal from benzos is much harder and much more dangerous. Make an informed decision before taking any medication-- particularly a class of drugs that can threaten your hard won sobriety.
The above is based on my research of the topic and is my opinion. To learn more and make your own informed decision about their use go to:

Freya12-22-2007, 03:30 PMGreat that you posted this, Lia. It's not just your opinion, it's the opinion of all rehabs over here as well. Getting off alcohol is a breeze compared to benzos, and the damage those drugs do to you is immense. Takes you many, many years to get over, if at all you can.
Unfortunately, doctors still prescribe them indiscriminately, even to known alcoholics. There was an article in the paper a few days ago where psychiatrists complained about the lack of training in psych drugs in med school (three days, including shock-treatment). And since most benzos are prescribed by regular GP's the significance of this is huge.....a lot of doctors have no idea of what they're prescribing when it comes to drugs that affect the brain.
Thanks for posting this.
dreamer12-24-2007, 12:16 AMIs Flexeril a benzo? I was prescribed them for my shoulder but they don't make me feel woozy or anything? Are they addictive?
Mybrokenhand12-25-2007, 06:01 AMAh.......I need to pipe in here. I take xanax and clonopin actively. Generally 2 mg of xanax at night to sleep and sometimes a clonopin during the day to keep myself calm. Depending upon the time of year, I will take xanax throughout the day.
These are medications - not ""drugs"" - that I need to treat my manic depression. Many people drink to medicate anxiety, panic and depressive disorders and these medications can be extremely helpful to treat them.
I don't get ""high"" from xanax - I get relief. My doctor is well aware of my addictions and has no reservations about prescribing me xanax.
It is true that benzos can be wildly addictive and disastrous for some; however, if you suffer from panic, anxiety or mania, benzos can be very therapeutic and prevent alcohol abuse. BUT, their use should be discussed with a competent psychiatrist.
Lia~~12-26-2007, 06:31 PMMBH---
xanax is not the drug of choice for sleep. It is extremely good for acute anxiety attacks in panic disorder. But long term-- many better drugs. You are on a dose that is going to require major help with withdrawal. Physiological. YOU do the research.
I want to make sure you know--- I am very PRO medication therapy. Correcting chemical imbalances in the CNS has allowed may of us to lead much better lives-- and stay sober ( ME included). But the wrong drugs make us worse.
SSRI's, atypical antipsychotics-- have do wonders for people with anxiety/depression and alcoholism. The benzos are simply exchanging addictions, except on short term basis ( 2 weeks max). Do your own research. You don't want a benzo addiction.
MBH-- if your doc knows you are an alcoholic and is prescribing that much xanax for you-- I would find another doc.
But I am an unknown person on the internet. Read the links I provided. Do your own research. Make an informed decision.
PBgirl12-30-2007, 03:38 PMOh no.....what if I'm addicted to xanax? I've been taking .25 mg at night for awhile now. Sometimes I've taken .50 mg. I don't think I could sleep without it. I'm kinda scared. I should probably start to back off of this but I can't do it now.

Very intersting article!
Neha02-12-2008, 01:32 AMI've been addicted to Xanax as well as Ambien (though it's not in the benzo family, it comes close). Professor Ashton in the link Lia has provided (www.benzo.org (http://www.benzo.org)) is supposed to be a world authority in benzos. It's worth reading her stuff.
This was my experience, that's all. Ultimately (hopefully) the doctors will know. Though benzos are easily available without prescription. In my city, they can give you hundreds at a time (with a premium added of course).
BadSanta02-20-2008, 11:58 AMI have already shared my own experience on this board several times about benzos but I'll do it again. Benzos and alcoholics don't mix well. Benzos act like alcohol in a pill on steroids. My direct experience is being prescribed them for just a week and I went cold turkey off them. It made alcohol withdrawal seem like childs play and I thought I was going to die.
My friend which I had known a long time was having anxiety attacks while going thru a divorce and was on a larger dose. He went cold turkey and went into seizures on his kitchen floor and has never been the same, and that was several years ago. It did something to his brain and his personality changed. He can't even walk in a straight line anymore and his arms twitch constantly. I don't know what dose he was on but mine was only 0.25 mg and really affected me. A benzo is a powerful med/drug and I think we need to be our own educated advocate before putting that stuff into our bodies.
-Santa
Freya02-22-2008, 01:28 PMBenzos require medical supervision when you want to quit them, precisely because of what Santa writes. You can actually die from Benzo withdrawal.....or suffer other very grave consequences.
Benzos are extremely dangerous, and should only be regarded as a very short-term solution. The Danish Health Ministry advices that patients not be on it longer than four weeks. And that's for normal people, not addicts. Inexplicably, doctors here (most of them have only a slight conception of the meds they prescribe, but that's perhaps a world-wide phenomenon, now that there are so many drugs on the market) still prescribe Benzos.
I've seen people who have been on Benzos for a long time.....it's not a pretty picture, those pills really fuck with your brain.
allthatkatydid07-25-2010, 04:21 AMI have an appointment this Tuesday to review my meds with my GP. Reading this has now got me very worried. 3 years ago I was prescribed Rohypnol to counteract insomnia caused by discomfort while trying to get to sleep with a badly compacted fracture. I have since moved from Ireland to the UK were Rohypnol is no longer prescribed and was therefore prescribed 40 mg of Temazepam in it's place. I still have the compacted fracture plus another unhealed fracture caused during shoulder surgery, the outcome of which was unsuccessful. So my pain issues remain the same and the 40 mgs of Temazepam doesn't really work as well as it used to. I also take quite large doses of painkillers for nerve damage and obviously fractured bone pain.
I'm afraid my GP will suggest that I stop taking Temazepam and withdraw the prescription. I forgot to bring my meds on an overnight stay away from home recently and quite honestly that night without Temazepam nearly drove me insane. I suffered chronic withdrawal symptoms that included palpitations, anxiety, rebound insomnia, muscle cramps and a whole host of other unwanted side effects.
manatee hunter07-25-2010, 07:57 PMSince the post was resurrected, I'll point out that despite the claim in the first post, Valium does not have a short half life, rather, it has one of the longest half lives of currently available benzos.
Some claim that this makes long acting benzos like Valium and Librium less addictive. I don't know if that's true or false but, I do agree that it is best to stay away from all of them unless under close medical supervision for valid reasons.
B sober07-31-2010, 02:34 PMSince the post was resurrected, I'll point out that despite the claim in the first post, Valium does not have a short half life, rather, it has one of the longest half lives of currently available benzos.
I think that is a fact, or rather, I found out that it is a fact when I started looking at quitting taking them. Wherever I looked I found the same warnings: Half-time is very long, which means that if you take some every day you'll accumulate much more in your body than a daily doses, and don't think about quitting without professional help, it can be very dangerous.
Some claim that this makes long acting benzos like Valium and Librium less addictive. I don't know if that's true or false but, I do agree that it is best to stay away from all of them unless under close medical supervision for valid reasons.
As you will see in the B sober thread, I am going off Valium right now under a detox specialist's supervision and he is 100% sure that quitting alcohol is a walk in the park compared to quitting Valium.
Three days for the alcohol, much longer for Valium, and he calls me every morning to check how I'm doing (and even allows me to have an emergency pill with me at all times just in case I feel I'm going crazy).
The person I blame, except myself of course, is the GP who prescribed them to me in the first place with vague instructions on how often to take them after the initial three days he had suggested (he gave me a lot more pills than he should have). ""As needed"" is not a clever thing to tell an addict.

Alcoholism Drugs Detox
Alcoholism Drugs DetoxAlcohol Detoxification The first step in treating Alcoholism Drugs is to remove alcohol from the system, and this is much more involved than merely “sleeping it off.” Dextox is necessary because a person cannot participate in the treatment Programs and gain full benefit from the educational opportunity if he/she is in any way under the influence. Recovery starts when the alcohol is out of the system, Alcoholism Drugs Detox is generally the first step..So what does that entail? This can be a tricky process and people should not try to detox without medical assistance. Alcohol withdrawal is potentially very dangerous. The body can react violently towards the removal of alcohol, as it craves more. Detox is designed to remove the symptoms of withdrawal and help the patient through the procedure. While Alcoholism Drugs detox is a relatively short-term process, it has long-term value for helping Alcoholism Drugss in recovery. The withdrawal symptoms usual begin between six and 48 hours after heavy drinking. The symptoms will both lessen and increase between 24 and 48 hours. Part of the medical aspect of detox is the patient receiving a physical examination. This is a good idea because there may be some preexisting medical condition that could be exacerbated during detox. Conditions such as an irregular heartbeat, inadequate heart function, liver disease, Alcoholism Drugs pancreatitis and digestive bleeding, can all be problematic in detox. It’s important for the patient to receive adequate medical care prior to the detox taking place.Where is Alcoholism Drugs detox done?Detox can be done in an inpatient or outpatient, but should always be under medical supervision. In their article “Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal”, Hugh Myrick MD and Raymond F. Anton MD, state that before 1980, most alcohol detox was done in a clinical setting, but since then, most treatments are done outpatient. They went on to say that at present, fewer than 20 percent require admission into inpatient status. However, when needed, inpatient is the safest approach to Alcoholism Drugs detox.The important factor is the medical oversight of the detox. This is necessary because detox can be very difficult, if not traumatic. Some people might only experience mild side effects of alcohol withdrawal, such as the “shakes.” They may also have a loss of appetite, headaches, sweating and insomnia. They may feel sick to their stomach and feel generally uneasy. But it could be worse and often is. You’re probably heard of people seeing pink elephants, which is a description of Delirium Tremors, the “DT’s.” About 5% of patients experience these, and they occur usually between two to four days after the patient has stopped drinking. People can have convulsions, or experience autonomic hyperactivity, common to patients with epilepsy. Their eyes roll back and they shake. The withdrawal might also produce a seizure. The risk of seizures is high, as approximately 25% people will experience one during detox if not medically treated. You can see it’s serious business.May only take a couple of daysDetox may only take a couple of days, but it can take up to two weeks for some patients. Some possible drugs that are used by doctors during detox include selected benzodiazepines, buprenophex and anticonvulsant medications. In outpatient settings, where people have mild symptoms of withdrawal, carbamazepine is an alternative drug to benzodiazepine. Treatment for alcohol withdrawal isn’t without its controversy. For mild to moderate symptoms, should any medications be administered? Most agree that when severe withdrawal is the case, medication is absolutely necessary. The debate over medications in the mild to moderate cases continues. In the severe cases, the benzodiazepines (BZs) that are used to treat anxiety, insomnia and seizures, are used. Research is being done on non-BZ treatments.It’s important to consider the whole person in Alcoholism Drugs detox. That is why it’s important for medical intervention before and during detox. It’s the first and certainly one of the most critical steps taken towards recovery.Read how long it takes to get alcohol out of your system.Also read about a friend who never wanted to detox and paid the ultimate for for his decision.A bitter-sweet story of a man who refused to detox from alcohol.For the next step in treatment after Alcoholism Drugs Detox go to TreatmentHOW TO USE THIS SITE:This site contains five MAIN pages that EVERYONE should read:ABOUT… SYMPTOMS… CAUSES… TREATMENT… RECOVERY… Read these five pages and learn what you need to know to spot Alcoholism Drugs in: Yourself...

For the Friends & Family For the Alcohol-Dependent Font Size: | Print Alcohol Withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a set of symptoms that people have when they suddenly stop drinking after using alcohol for a long period of time. Withdrawal symptoms rarely occur in people who only drink once in a while. Symptoms usually occur in people who have been drinking heavily for weeks or months and then suddenly stop drinking. People who have gone through withdrawal before are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms each time they quit drinking.1 The signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal typically appear between 6 and 48 hours after heavy alcohol consumption decreases. Initial symptoms may include headache, tremor, sweating, agitation, anxiety and irritability, nausea and vomiting, heightened sensitivity to light and sound, disorientation, difficulty concentrating, and in more serious cases, transient hallucinations.2 These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld.3 The worst form of withdrawal is called ""DTs"" (delirium tremens). DTs can be very serious if not treated by a doctor.1 More serious withdrawal symptoms occur in approximately 10 percent of patients. These symptoms include a low-grade fever, rapid breathing, tremor, and profuse sweating. Seizures may occur in more than 5 percent of untreated patients in acute alcohol withdrawal. The mortality rate among patients exhibiting DT's is 5 to 25 percent. The DT's are a serious manifestation of alcohol dependence that develops 1 to 4 days after the onset of acute alcohol withdrawal in persons who have been drinking excessively for years. Co-occurring medical problems may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of DT's or worsen the outcome. Such medical problems include altered blood chemistry, certain infections, and Wernicke's syndrome.4 Alcohol withdrawal is a clinical syndrome that affects people accustomed to regular alcohol intake who either decrease their alcohol consumption or stop drinking completely. In these people, the central nervous system has adjusted to the constant presence of alcohol in the body and compensates for alcohol's depressive effects on both brain function and the communication among nerve cells. When the alcohol level is suddenly lowered, the brain remains in a hyperactive, or hyperexcited, state, causing withdrawal syndrome.3 If people go through withdrawal a number of times without getting the right treatment, the symptoms may get worse each time. Those who have had a bad withdrawal before and those who have other health problems, such as infections, heart disease, lung disease or a history of seizures should see a doctor to discuss treatment. Medicines can control the shakiness, anxiety and confusion that come with alcohol withdrawal. Only a doctor can prescribe these medicines. If you take the medicines at an early stage of the withdrawal, they may keep your symptoms from getting worse.1 Related Articles: Alcohol Poisoning References American Academy of Family Physicians.

Addiction Withdrawal Topics
As with most medications for mental illnesses, sudden cessation of antipsychotic medication is not recommended without medical supervision.
The withdrawal symptoms with barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be worse than withdrawal from heroin.
Withdrawal from certain drugs such as benzodiazepines or alcohol can be fatal and therefore the abrupt discontinuation of any type of drug is not recommended.
When a stimulant-dependent individual abstains from stimulant use, withdrawal symptoms, including depression, fatigue, insomnia, and loss of appetite, reflects a drop in neurotransmitter levels in the brain.
Ativan Withdrawal
Ativan withdrawal occurs when an individual develops dependence to the drug and experiences physical and psychological symptoms when they stop using it. Ativan is a highly potent benzodiazepine drug that has strong sedative/hypnotic effects. It is used medically for the short-term treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures and sedation of hospitalized or aggressive patients. Benzodiazepines are generally used as sedatives, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anti-anxiety, anticonvulsant and as muscle relaxants and amnesic action. Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate- or long-acting. Ativan is mostly used for short-term management of severe anxiety, and the FDA advises against use of benzodiazepines such as Ativan for longer than 2-4 weeks.
Abrupt, or overly rapid cessation of the drug can cause withdrawal symptoms, and Ativan withdrawal has been known to occur even after taking medically prescribed doses of Ativan for as little as one week. This is because Ativan can cause physical dependence and addiction. Short-acting benzodiazepines like Ativan is more likely to cause severe withdrawal symptoms as compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines. Severity of Ativan withdrawal symptoms is dependent on dosage and duration of use. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of Ativan withdrawal.
Ativan withdrawal symptoms can range from mild anxiety and insomnia to more severe symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. Common Ativan withdrawal symptoms include headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. It takes approximately 18-36 hours for Ativan to remove itself from the body.
Ativan belongs to the Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category D, which means that it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby, if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. Regular Ativan use during late pregnancy (the third trimester), puts the unborn child at risk of Ativan withdrawal syndrome. Neonatal Ativan withdrawal may include muscle weakness, reluctance to suck, apneic spells, blue or purple coloration of the skin due to low oxygen, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Neonatal Ativan withdrawal has been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Ativan may also inhibit liver function, leading to neonatal jaundice. Ativan does pass into breast milk, so caution must be exercised when breast feeding.
Ativan is commonly abused as a recreational drug, where it is taken to achieve a high, or use is continued long term against medical advice. Individuals using the drug in this way are at risk of Ativan withdrawal, not to mention serious health consequences if mixed with other drugs or alcohol. Ativan has also been diverted and used by criminals who take the drug to deliberately seek disinhibition before committing crimes, which increases their potential for violence. The amnesia and sedative-hypnotic effects of Ativan make it a drug of choice for predators on unwitting victims as date rape drugs, or for the purpose of robbery.
A nationwide study of emergency room visits found that sedative-hypnotics such as Ativan are the pharmaceuticals most frequently used outside of their prescribed medical purpose. An estimated 35% of drug-related emergency room visits involved sedative-hypnotics, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used. Benzodiazepines such as Ativan are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drug pharmaceutical-related suicide attempts, with 26% of attempted suicides involving benzodiazepines. Ativan was the third-most-common benzodiazepine used outside of prescription in the emergency room visit study.
Aside from Ativan withdrawal, the drug causes many adverse side effects, which are increased if combined with other drugs or alcohol. The most common side effect that is reported is sedation. Other adverse effects can include hypotension, confusion, ataxia, amnesia and hangover effects. Ativan also appears to have serious adverse effects on memory and is known to cause cognitive impairment which may or may not be reversible. Adverse effects are more common in the elderly, which are experienced at lower doses than in younger individuals. Benzodiazepines such as Ativan can also cause or worsen depression. Adverse effects from Ativan are dose-dependent, meaning the higher the dose, the stronger the effects and side effects.
Ativan, whether used medically or recreationally, is a highly potent drug that is addictive and can cause individuals to become dependent. It is important that anyone deciding to stop using Ativan seek help to get through Ativan withdrawal at a long-term inpatient drug treatment facility where professional and medically trained staff can get them through this process.

Posting for a friend who wishes to remain anonymous:
I am at the end of my third day of not drinking alcohol after 5-10 years (I’m not exactly sure how long it’s been) of drinking almost every day. I have some questions about withdrawal that I can't seem to find the answers to.
The last time I remember not drinking in any 24 hour period was about three years ago, when I went 7-10 days without drinking. Back then, I didn’t have any physical withdrawal that I noticed.
For the past three years or so, a light drinking day would be 2-3 drinks (by “drink” I mean the standard one 12oz beer, one glass of wine, or one 1.5 oz shot of liquor -- though I almost always drank beer), a normal day (most weekdays) would be 4-6 drinks, and a heavy day (usually a Friday and/or Saturday) could be up to 10-16 drinks. I always drank after work on the weekdays (after 7pm) and usually started in the early afternoon on weekends. For reference, I’m a early-30s male, about 200 pounds.
I think compared to my friends, and indeed most people, I would be considered a pretty heavy drinker, except for 2 things: a) I never have had any of the warning signs of serious problem drinking, ie legal problems, fighting, waking up in strange places, hospitalization, drinking at work, (I live in a city where I don’t need to drive, and indeed don’t have a car) and b) more importantly, I almost never drink to get drunk -- I drank just enough to calm my anxiety. By that I mean, I was almost always a very steady drinker – so that when I drank a six-pack at night, it was over 5-6 hours, from when I got home at 7 to when I fell asleep at midnight. Even if I drank 16 drinks, it would be over about twelve hours. So from looking at BAC charts based on my weight, I am guessing that my blood alcohol usually was no more than the 0.10-0.19 level. I would be noticeably intoxicated, but not stumbling around, passing out, incoherent drunk.
The reason I drank steadily, every day, is that I was self-medicating my anxiety. I have had general anxiety and panic attacks since I was a teenager, and alcohol reliably relieved it for me. I was very anti-medication and psychology for a long time, and alcohol seemed a natural, and somewhat romantic alternative to me. I imagined myself as kind of the Winston Churchill/Frank Sinatra/Hunter Thompson type of drinker – highly functional (I have several advanced degrees and a great paying, very selective career), and someone whose health was never affected by drinking.
However, recently, my feelings about my relationship with alcohol began to change. While it still relieved my anxiety in the short term, I started to notice my anxiety getting much worse after a heavy drinking day(s) (usually on Monday morning). My anxiety would then affect my work, and in the last few months I even found myself either having a drink or two during the day at work (which I had sworn I’d never do), or leaving work to go to the hospital because I was having a severe panic attack. I began to wonder if my drinking was getting so heavy that I was having alcohol withdrawal – or even DT’s. As the symptoms of withdrawal and those of a panic attack are so similar, I started losing my ability to calm down, because while I have learned to deal with a panic attack (it is harmless), I know that true alcohol withdrawal can be very dangerous. Finally, I have become overweight and I am certain it is mostly because of the calories from all the alcohol I’m drinking.
Which brings me to now. I had tried so many times to stop drinking over the past year, and I could never bring myself to do it – mostly because I was afraid that if I stopped, I would have withdrawal symptoms or even a seizure or heart attack. I didn’t think my drinking was heavy enough for that, but the internet says that DTs usually occur in people who drink more than 7-8 pints of beer a day (which I exceeded a once or twice a week and got halfway to most other days). And if that’s the most severe withdrawal, then surely someone like me who averages five or six beers a day would have at least moderate withdrawal, right? But on the other hand, I thought, 7-8 pints of beer a day is one thing for a 120-pound woman and quite another for a 200-pound man. And 7-8 pints is one thing when you drink it in two hours, and quite another when you drink it over 6 hours, as I typically would if I were drinking that much. Either way, my anxiety would make me imagine the worst case scenario, and while I would occasionally cut down, I couldn’t quite bring myself to completely stop.
So anyway, here I am. It’s been 72 hours since I “stopped” drinking. I say “stopped” in quotes because in each 24 hour period I’ve had a single 12 oz can of beer, sipped very slowly, to calm my anxiety – and I don’t think I will need to do that again today. My only symptom during this time has been mild to moderate anxiety. I have gone running about 4km each day. I have also taken one 0.5 mg tablet of Xanax twice a day (in the morning and afternoon) – which I have historically taken when I have panic attacks. If you’re not familiar with Xanax, this is a fairly low dose.
So that’s my story – here are my questions:
1. I have read dozens of articles online about alcohol withdrawal. Many of them say that symptoms usually start 2-12 hours after the last drink, that more severe symptoms like seizures can happen 24 to 48 hours after the last drink, and DTs can occur 48 to 72 hours after the last drink. I’ve even seen some sources say DTs can happen 7 to 10 days after the last drink.
a. How could severe symptoms begin so long after the alcohol has left a person’s body?
b. Could a person have no (or mild) symptoms for two or three days after their last drink, and then suddenly develop severe symptoms (seizures) after that?
c. Would drinking literally one can of beer somehow “reset” the clock, so that even though I had one beer a day over the last three days, I am not really 72 hours “after my last drink”?
2. I’m already feeling really great about my decision to stop drinking, and am going to give it at least a month. However, I feel right now that I have enough control over my drinking that I don’t need to give it up completely forever. While I don’t plan to go back to drinking the amounts I used to, does anyone think it’s reasonable to believe that my way of “steadily” drinking was healthier, and less addictive, than binge drinking to drunkenness (even if someone only binge drank on the weekends, instead of steadily drinking every day like me).
Thanks for reading. I would really appreciate your thoughts, and especially hearing your own personal experiences with similar situations.

Detox is really, really different for everyone. Your mileage will truly vary. Most people don't have seizures; some do. Some people just feel exhausted. Some people intensely crave sugar. Some people get shakes; some get headaches. Some people actually feel great!
It would be great, if you're not going to do this in a facility, where professionals assist people in getting off alcohol, if you at least had a friend who was (at the very least) checking in on you, if not actually physically present.
And yes: by any sane person's account, today, it sounds like, you are at Day One of your 30 day experiment. I think it would seem to most people totally reasonable that you didn't go the full cold turkey. Still, having ""a beer"" is ""drinking."" People who ""do not drink"" do not ""drink beers."" :)
You can make whatever plans about your future drinking you like. It seems great that you're starting a month's vacation from alcohol today.
As for all your Internet reading.... Reading online about alcohol detox is sort of like reading online about cancer treatment. All in all, rarely helpful, mostly useless. Is there some reason you're not willing to just talk with a professional about this in person? That would probably be really helpful, to have someone reality-checking you, and looking at you from the outside. (Not suggesting you check into a 28-day program! There's tons of out-patient and ad hoc alcohol treatment programming that you can use as needed--as well as people who are specialists in anxiety, which seems like something really worth treating.)posted by RJ Reynolds at 8:35 AM on April 23 [1 favorite]
Really tackle this thing. Do you have a doctor you can trust with this information? Go to them, if only for the peace of mind you will get from having ""medical supervision"" and a medical professional you can reach out to during this period. Better yet, a detox facility. Failing either of those, call a nurse line or alcohol abuse hotline and get some information about withdrawal. Psychologically, get some support for your anxiety and ending your alcohol use. Whether that be individual therapy or attending some kind of alcohol support, AA, Al-anon, etc. you NEED some support through this.
All the problem drinkers I know are ""high functioning."" The have jobs and a life. It is a total myth that most problem drinkers/alcoholics are home all day drinking, unemployed, ranting and actively destroying their lives. The real toll is the time you lose when you are drinking every night to calm your anxiety. How much more satisfying could your life be with your anxiety truly under control, all that extra time for you to pursue hobbies, or relationships, or just true relaxation?posted by Katine at 8:36 AM on April 23 [2 favorites]
For me, the worst withdrawal day was at about day 3. Day 1 was general anxiety and killer insomnia. Day 2 was shakes. Day 3 was full-blown crazy. I was very lucky to have somebody to keep an eye on me, as well as providing small doses of klonopin to help me sleep through the nights. Quite frankly, I probably should have been in a medical facility on day 3, but I was on the tail end of it, so I just toughed it out, telling myself that it wasn't any worse than a bad flu.
My drinking was heavier than what you describe, and I did go completely cold turkey (except for a small glass of whiskey which got me through the first day, which I no longer count among my sober days), so I'm not sure how the two compare. My guess is that if after three days, you're only at my day 1, then you're probably going to come out of it just fine. Total physical withdrawal can take you as long as a month. I'm not sure of the 'why' behind that, but that was my experience. Feel free to me-mail me if you want the gory details on what you might expect.posted by Gilbert at 8:45 AM on April 23 [1 favorite]
To address the last part of your question, in my experience being witness to a similar situation your thinking is reasonable but wrong. By that I mean that you are able to reason with yourself to come to those conclusions -- that this is a self-medication, that you are in control, and that you are not suffering consequences from your drinking. Your arguments are compelling to yourself because they reinforce what you want to believe, but will not stand up to objective scrutiny.
The self-medication aspect: Whether or not the anxiety that you experience was originally linked to your drinking, it is now. The alcohol you consume has been reinforcing your belief that drinking can solve your anxiety, but is now creating greater anxiety than what you used to experience, to the point that you have to drink to address it while you are at work. Also, since you have been numbing yourself to the feelings of anxiety you have, you've never had a chance to look for and solve their root cause. As long as you are using alcohol to numb your anxiety, you will not be able to seek a cure rather than the debilitating treatment you have found. Often when people stop drinking they experience a resurgence of the things that drove them to seek alcohol in the first place -- it looks like you have already found a friend in banishedimmortal that you can talk to about those feelings as they come up, but a professional therapist will be even better equipped to help you. Please consider meeting with a psychiatrist, as alcohol does strange things to brain chemistry, and they are trained specifically in how brain chemistry can affect mood and behavior.posted by kitarra at 8:50 AM on April 23 [2 favorites]
IANAD and I have no personal detox story. But here's an assessment tool that healthcare providers use to evaluate the severity of alcohol withdrawal (sorry, it's a PDF - Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar)). If you score less than 10, usually you won't receive any treatment beyond ""eat right, stay hydrated, maybe take some b-vitamins and NSAIDs."" If you're between 10 and 20, they'd want to keep an eye on you and maybe start you on drug treatment. If you're over 20, they would be trying to get some drugs into you and probably keeping you in an inpatient setting.posted by mskyle at 8:51 AM on April 23 [1 favorite]
I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice, but if you are drinking a little bit and taking benzos, I would guess that it would significantly reduce your withdrawal effects.
I have no idea what will happen if you stop the one can of beer and Xanax - has it done it's work and now you have no significant withdrawal effects? Or do you get delayed withdrawal effects? This would be a good question for an actual doctor.posted by insectosaurus at 8:56 AM on April 23
Congrats on day one. You're on a journey now. Come back after a month and let us know how it went. You're going to learn a lot about yourself. Pay attention to your body and mind and do what seems right. Seconding the above that ""not drinking"" means zero drinks. As for the second part of your question, the answer is no. There is nothing about your drinking that is ""healthier or less addictive"" than people who also drink heavily but in different ways. If you were to surround yourself with people who have decided to quit drinking and listen to their stories, I think you'd find a lot you can relate to.posted by TurkishGolds at 8:59 AM on April 23 [2 favorites]
My husband had a very similar drinking pattern/level as you do, and there's also an element of anxiety self-medication going on in his case (although his anxieties are not severe and he doesn't experience panic attacks). He never got falling-down drunk, and got stumbly/slurred speech drunk pretty rarely. He never got violent or angry, or missed work, or any of those things. He quit drinking a little over a year ago, after many, many failed attempts to ""take an alcohol vacation"" or moderate his intake.
When he quit, he did not experience any serious withdrawal symptoms, although of course that's merely ancedotal and doesn't address your question of whether/how it might happen to you.
The thing that finally compelled him to quit was when he was diagnosed with alcoholic cardiomyopathy, although even then, ""alcoholic"" thinking pushed him to try to find any other possible reason for his enlarged heart.
The thing that helped him succeed at quitting was working with an addiction therapist. That helped him with concrete strategies for avoiding drinking, explore the motivations that were driving him to drink and come up with alternative strategies, and clarify some of the distorted thought patterns that are characteristic of addition (my pattern of addition isn't as bad as some other pattern, so it's not that bad...I can just go back to a ""normal"" relationship with alcohol once I'm sober for a while, etc.).
The one difference he had compared to you was many, many FAILED quits. He didn't have a hard time quitting at all! He did it lots of times! The hard part was staying quit. He'd delude himself, just like you are, that he could control it.posted by SomeTrickPony at 9:01 AM on April 23 [1 favorite]
If your expectation is that drinking constantly, or drinking moderately or lightly but constantly, is an okay thing, because you have a great career, or in order to avoid delirium tremens, or because you have diagnosed yourself with anxiety, or because you've gained weight but aren't altogether unattractive and still do things like jogging, then my friend, if my experience is worth a single damn to anyone, you might have a drinking problem.
Let me suggest some thoughts, since there's only so much one can share in a format such as this. What is drinking for? Isn't it to have a good time, celebrate? Meet people, be casual, have fun? Drinking is not for quelling panic attacks. You're using a hammer to screw in a nail. People having a good time drinking don't go home and check blood alcohol level charts.
Normal people don't look at homeless drunks and people in the hospital and think ""at least I'm not that bad."" Have you considered the idea that if you have to ""control"" your drinking, then despite your rationalizations, by definition it is out of control?
Since it sounds like you are a very earnest and well-intentioned person, I would suggest you read up on alcoholism as a ""chronic and progressive"" illness. If you take a month off drinking and then start to drink again, and the same issues pop up again, and if you try to stop drinking again and start again and seem to get nowhere, and if things never seem to get better, and in fact start to get worse, and you're all alone and you keep this a secret from people you love, you might have a drinking problem.
Honestly I think the best thing you can do is get some help from someone. (You can mefimail if you want too.) Because it sounds like you are trapped in your head but you are trying to reach out. Good luck.posted by phaedon at 9:06 AM on April 23 [12 favorites]
I quit drinking for a month once. It was utterly meaningless in the long term - I just resumed drinking, sure, somewhat less at first (only on the weekends! never before 5 PM!), but I was right back where I had been before, or worse, before long. If you've reached the point where you really have an alcohol problem, you are just not going to make it go away by short term abstention. And yes, a month is short-term.posted by thelonius at 9:07 AM on April 23 [3 favorites]
So, look, you haven't stopped drinking. You've tapered way back. If that feels good to you, keep doing what works, but kidding yourself about what you're doing isn't useful.
I have no idea what kind of alcohol intake is going to be your threshold for not triggering extreme physical withdrawal symptoms, and really the only person who does is a physician experienced in treating people with those issues. None of us can tell you, and the Internet isn't going to be able to tell you.
Honestly, you sound like a (high-functioning) alcoholic to me, the way you are going to such lengths to rationalize why it's OK for you to drink and why it's important to you to keep drinking and why your drinking really isn't a problem because you weigh 200 pounds and everyone else is doing it and you can stop any time you want.
Except, fuck it, you CAN'T stop any time you want. You have to keep drinking and taking benzos (and 1 mg a day of Xanax isn't a ""low dose"", it's an average dose) so that you won't get the DTs. How is that drinking that's under control?posted by Sidhedevil at 9:38 AM on April 23 [5 favorites]
I quit drinking for six months once because my then-boyfriend was giving me shit about what he saw as my excessive drinking. I was also self-medicating anxiety and drinking at bedtime to get to sleep.
I quit cold turkey (and didn't have any physical reaction except digestive issues and headaches, thank heaven!) I didn't touch a drop of liquor or any recreational alcohol for a year, but added tasting wine back after six months (tasting wine was actually part of my job responsibilities at that time, and the colleague who was covering for me became pregnant so she couldn't keep doing it).
It was easy for me, so I felt comfortable going back to social drinking since I had broken the pattern of drinking at bedtime, etc. I might have four or five drinks a week at most, now.
You're talking about this as though your month of lessened drinking and average Xanax use is an experiment that is going to prove you're not an alcoholic so that you can go right back to your current drinking patterns. Do you not see how little sense this makes?posted by Sidhedevil at 9:44 AM on April 23 [1 favorite]
It's not a direct answer to any of your questions, but you may want your friend to check out the 'stopdrinking' group at Reddit. There are a lot of people there with varying experiences and good support. YOu can easily drop this question in there and get some good feedback.
I gave up drinking about 8 months ago, and while I pretty much suspected I was in no danger from withdrawal, I did it with support from my doctor just to keep things monitored and in check. I strongly recommend this.posted by Frasermoo at 9:50 AM on April 23 [4 favorites]
does anyone think it’s reasonable to believe that my way of “steadily” drinking was healthier, and less addictive, than binge drinking to drunkenness
Sort of? This is tortured thinking. You've done a great job sort of outlining why you drink and how it's affected your life and good on you for addressing it but I echo other people that you haven't stopped drinking. You may want to spend some time googling ""Functioning alcoholic"" for a lot of examples of people who do not do the ""drink til i am puking in the gutter"" thing but at the same time still have alcohol being an organizing factor of their life.
My dad died last year after being a functioning alcoholic [good job, decent life] for my entire life. His life wasn't negatively impacted by his drinking because he had basically decided to revolve his life entirely around alcohol. He was also an anxiety-managing alcoholic who would start drinking at 5 pm on the dot and if he couldn't start then for some reason, he'd start shaking. His wife left him when he turned 69 because he was a crabby drunk and his last years were not his finest. Like you he had weight problems and health problems and a variety of coping strategies and rationalizations for why his life was the way it was, mostly blaming the family that he'd driven away.
I say this to you not to be all ""so quit drinking for real, you dumbass!"" but mostly to say the issue is that if you don't develop coping strategies for your anxieties and/or your loneliness and whatever, you lose the ability to do that as you get older. Your romantic perception of yourself comes up against other people's perceptions of you less and less because you interact sincerely with fewer and fewer real life people. This enables you to keep doing what you're doing with fewer and fewer reality checks. You stop trusting people because their perspectives are marred by what you think of as their own ""wrong"" thinking about your drinking and how it's either helping you or not hurting you, fuck them.
So, yeah, no, I'm not going to call your regular drinking healthier any more than I'd call smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day healthier than smoking a full pack. You're still in the ""you're cruising for a cancer diagnosis"" range and listening to you justify it is just too familiar. Sorry and best of luck with whatever you decide to do.posted by jessamyn at 9:51 AM on April 23 [14 favorites]
Lots of good comments in this thread. I'm just going to speak from my personal experience as an alcoholic who has spent a lot of time around other alcoholics. The PROGRESSIVE nature of alcoholism is pretty important and relevant here. I drank for a long time just like you and I knew I was a heavy drinker but I had a job and a house and my stuff seemed under control until it wasn't anymore. That switch turned so quickly for me that even friends and family who were aware what a heavy drinker I was were shocked that I could not stop.
I do think there are a lot of rationalizations in your story and that is something that throws up red flags for those of us that are alcoholics or have spent a lot of time around alcoholics. I can rationalize ANYTHING! Including drinking in the morning! Alcohol can alleviate symptoms of anxiety, but they almost always come back worse. That you were once opposed to pyschiatry and drugs but perfectly fine with self medicating through alcohol is almost exactly my story. I believed that I was in control with benzos and alcohol that I took at my discretion. The stuff I was often prescribed almost never provided the particular effect that I was looking for. I learned later that what I was looking for was not meant to be treated with medicine. I was constantly chasing the perfect drunk/high/level of relaxation/numbness etc. Modern medicine is not meant to provide that.
My withdrawal and detox from alcohol was much more severe than yours. However, the first time I detoxed the worst day was day 4, that is when I began to hallucinate. My very crude understanding is that the cause of withdrawal is not the alcohol leaving your body. It is your body attempting to function without the presence of something it has grown to expect in your body. So when all the traces are gone, your brain does not know how to work ""properly"" without the substance it has come to depend on.
Look, I would never call you an alcoholic because that is something you must decide for yourself. However, if you really want to take a serious crack at this, try to give up alcohol for a year. Really give yourself a chance to learn some new coping mechanisms for your anxiety, without thinking ""just one or two more weeks and I can go back to what I used to do"". I hope I don't sound judgmental to you. I promise that it can be an amazing experiment, and you might decide you never want to go back to daily drinking ever again. If not, alcohol will always be right there where you left it. I would love to answer any specific questions you have if you'd like to memail me.posted by thankyouforyourconsideration at 9:54 AM on April 23 [7 favorites]
I am a doctor. I am not YOUR doctor, and this is not medical advice.
I am not going to address your feelings about alcohol vs. medication or whether you have a drinking problem because I think the commenters above have done that much more eloquently than I could. However:
The chronic effects of alcohol on the brain are still poorly understood, but it is clear that chronic alcohol use has a significant effect on the levels of certain neurotransmitters (NMDA and GABA for example). When you remove the alcohol, some neurotransmitters have been downregulated (the brain is producing less than it would otherwise) and some have been upregulated (the brain is producing more). This results in some wild swings in brain chemistry that manifest as withdrawal (and this is why it can take a few days to really kick in).
By drinking steadily rather than binging, you're avoiding the immediately toxic effects of alcohol but not the chronic effects like those on the brain, liver, and heart, which are being constantly bathed in alcohol and making complex physiological changes to adjust for that. It is not particularly healthier than binging except that you are not bumping into things or getting into fights and you're unlikely to get alcohol poisoning that way.
It is impossible, over the internet, to tell how bad your withdrawal is, especially since it sounds like you have an anxiety disorder that you have been self-medicating with alcohol as well. I would strongly urge you to see your doctor about this, because the physical exam is really important to assess withdrawal severity.
Just FYI, the hands-down worst case of alcohol withdrawal I've ever seen was in someone who had been a fairly senior member of a recent Presidential administration. Withdrawal and alcoholism are not just things that happen to vagrants and there are a LOT of functioning alcoholics out there, some of whom have very high level jobs.posted by The Elusive Architeuthis at 10:56 AM on April 23 [9 favorites]
One way of categorizing your consumption of alcohol is ""high risk."" You've not run into major consequences yet... YET!
The National Institutes of Health publishes guidelines for what ""low risk"" drinking looks like. Here's a webpage: http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/IsYourDrinkingPatternRisky/WhatsLowRiskDrinking.asp
This may be good information to keep in mind as you reconsider how much you should drink.posted by u2604ab at 11:38 AM on April 23
What I don't see in your plan is getting therapy for anxiety. Leaving aside the question of your drinking habits for a minute, what strikes me is that your fixation on withdrawal symptoms seems to have a lot to do with your anxiety.posted by yarly at 12:56 PM on April 23 [3 favorites]
I quit drinking 22 days ago. My previous ""record"" for not drinking in the past four years was 7 days. Most nights I drank until I was numb, but not drunk, just like you. I'm in my 30's, just like you. I'm overweight, probably from the extra calories in the alcohol, just like you. And I could easily go through a large bottle of rum over a weekend, just like you.
If your relationship with alcohol is anything like mine, quitting for a week is not going to cut it. I'm tired of being consumed. I'm tired of getting sick because my body is busy fighting off poison instead of germs. I'm tired of waking up in the middle of the night with a dry mouth and a full bladder. It's over. I decided on April Fools' Day, of all days, that I will not be a slave to this anymore.
The last time I ""quit"" I gave myself an out. I planned on quitting for a week, just to prove I could. And on day eight, I drank to celebrate my success. This time it is completely different. No outs. No wistful looks at the liquor store. I even took my son to a hockey game last week and wasn't envious of the guys drinking beer because I could visualize the bright future in front of me - one free of alcohol.
It sounds cheesy, but it's true. And I know I'm just starting too, because 22 days isn't very long. So I will pray for you and success beating this and I'll also continue to pray for my own success. Good luck out there.posted by tacodave at 3:53 PM on April 23 [9 favorites]
IANAD, but I have gone off drinking at heavy levels (similar to yours) with the aid of benzos at the level you are taking, under medical care (by which I mean, my doctors--plural because I've done this more than once--knew what I was doing and prescribed the xanax), without trouble.
I do not think that, three days in, you are going to suddenly have a seizure, especially not with the xanax to help keep things under control. And no, a single beer does not ""reset the clock."" Going cold turkey off a regimen of heavy drinking can be dangerous; you are not going cold turkey, but using xanax and ""tapering"" with the single beers (though that's such a drastic reduction it hardly counts as tapering; you could probably have done as well with just the xanax). But--just to answer your question--if the single beer reset the clock, then it wouldn't be possible ever to taper off alcohol--and tapering IS one way to go off alcohol, just like any other drug; it's just not a method that is commonly used because alcoholics are pretty much by definition not great at controlling intake.
To address the questions about whether you will be able to pick up drinking again at a safe level, statistically it's probably unlikely, but individuals can't be reduced to statistics. I think it's great that you feel great and that even the single beer seems unnecessary to you now. Be on guard, I guess is all I'd say, because that switch in the brain between ""this feels great! I love being sober!"" and ""fuck it, I want a drink, and I'm having one"" is... well, it can flip in an instant. I'm someone who thought I could quit for a while and then pick up drinking moderately, but later had to acknowledge that any level of drinking just wasn't going to work out for me.
Just be careful, and be honest with yourself. Good luck.posted by torticat at 6:05 PM on April 23 [1 favorite]
Seconding the recommendation of /r/stopdrinking, which is a very fine support resource, that has been of great help to me.posted by thelonius at 6:18 PM on April 23
First of all, congrats for quitting. I think it's great that you have come to this decision and I applaud you for it. I've seen many others who never reached your stage of insight, and lost their lives (in a drawn-out, suffering-filled way) because of it.
As an ER doctor, I deal with a lot of drunk people. I deal with a lot of people who come in after doing something stupid, with a high blood alcohol level, and they get hurt or they hurt someone else. And a lot of these people, you wouldn't guess to look at them how high their blood alcohol level is going to be. Because they are so ""high functioning"" - that term is just another way of saying ""so used to drinking large amounts of alcohol that they don't seem drunk when they do it."" So just a couple of things from my point of view.
First of all, your definition of ""problem drinker"" is problematic, and it's inaccurate. It's your own definition you've come up with to make yourself feel better. This is the way medical professionals define problem drinking, and it has nothing to do with your income, your social status, or how you function while drinking.
C - Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your drinking? (obviously, you asked this question)
A - Have people ever Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? (how do you feel after reading the answers?)
G - Have you ever felt bad or Guilty about your drinking? (yes)
E - Ever had an ""Eye opener"" to ""steady your nerves"" in the morning? (yes)
By what you've already described, you're a ""yes"" to 3/4 of these questions, and possibly all 4. Answering yes to 2 or more of these questions makes it extremely likely that you are an alcoholic, that you are addicted to alcohol.
I can't tell you what kind of withdrawal you will experience, but I can tell you that you will not just be sitting there minding your own business and then bam! - have a seizure. Severe DTs don't strike out of the blue. They start as anxiety and build upwards and upwards. That's why you need a friend or ideally, a professional to help you through this process, to make sure you don't get to the point where you don't really have the capacity to figure out what's going on with yourself enough to keep yourself safe.
I would suggest you consider seriously the possibility that you may have had anxiety many years ago that you started to self medicate with alcohol, and what you experience as 'anxiety' and 'panic attacks' now might be you withdrawing from alcohol. Conveniently, the treatment for anxiety and the treatment for alcohol withdrawal (benzodiazepines) is the same.... this may or may not be the case but just wanted to point out that you may be using your anxiety as an excuse to yourself, i.e. ""I have never gotten symptoms of alcohol withdrawal - I just get anxious if I don't drink and the anxiety gets worse and worse the longer I've stopped drinking!""
As for the question of whether a steady high intake of alcohol is 'healthier' than binge drinking, I think the comparison above to cigarette smoking is an apt one. The steady high intake of alcohol can still lead to liver disease/failure, heart failure, and certain forms of dementia. And don't forget that high alcohol intake is a major risk factor for a number of deadly cancers such as esophageal cancer, mouth and throat cancers, liver and stomach cancers.
Best of luck and again, so glad to hear you're quitting - it's the best thing you can do for your health.posted by treehorn+bunny at 10:12 PM on April 23 [1 favorite]
Wow, reading some of these posts I am a little surprised at the responses. My guess is these people have never lived in a mill town or worked in a heavy construction crew, or on a highway crew like I did and stayed in FEMA trailers where they stacked 6 of us in there every night. The NIH link would be a joke to these people. 4 in one day in the past year? Christ, a six pack a night was the norm. It's no more complicated than the fact that these guys liked their beer. But they were in bed early and out the door earlier than most of you hear the alarm clock and then spent the rest of the day working their asses off around equipment you would not want someone playing with that was even slightly inebriated. Most accidents I recall were caused by faulty equipment or stupid mistakes, not drinking related. I never thought of any of them as alcoholics.
I cannot see putting a number on the number of beers per day/week/year as any sort of indicator for alcoholism, whatever that is. Good luck with whatever you do but don't let someone else decide what's best for you.
(By the way, every doctor, and most nurses that I can recall that I knew, saw, or came into contact with since I was 5 or so was overweight. Do I want them telling me about healthy eating habits? Hell man, my dermatologist was sunburned the last time I saw him).posted by bellastarr at 11:37 AM on April 26

Facts On Alcohol Withdrawal
August 28th, 2011
Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome is a collection of symptoms visible when an individual abruptly withdraws from alcohol consumption. It is due to alcohol’s ability to induce physiological dependence. This syndrome is characterized by neuropsychiatric excitability and autonomic disturbances that can get even severe when exposed to a variety of sedative hypnotics like alcohol. Withdrawals occurs when blood levels start to decrease and can be alleviated by reintroduction of a cross tolerant agent or alcohol itself.
Symptoms of Withdrawal
Age, genetics, degree of alcohol intake, length of time the individual is abusing alcohol and the number of previous detoxification are key variables in the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms can vary from mild to to life threatening. An individual suffering from the withdrawal may experience seizures and delirium tremens that can eventually lead to excito-neurotoxicity. The symptoms of the withdrawal includes but are not limited to agitation, anorexia, diarrhea, gastrointestinal upset, hypertension, fever, nausea, restlessness, headache, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, panic attacks, euphoria, palpitations, vomiting and even death.
Protracted withdrawal syndrome is referred to as the post acute withdrawal syndrome. It takes place beyond the acute withdrawal stage, gradually decreasing over time at low intensities. Some protracted withdrawal symptoms include craving for alcohol, a feeling of displeasure over things that were normally pleasurable, nausea, vomiting and headaches.
Treatments and Remedies for Withdrawal Symptoms
Recommended treatments for withdrawal syndrome are drugs that are categorized as benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam anti psychotic agents such as haloperidol, anti-convulsants such as topiramate carbamazepine, barbiturates, donidine and vitamins.
Benzodiazepines are generally safe and effective for subduing the symptoms of withdrawal. It is also used in alcohol detoxification. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are the commonly used type in withdrawal treatments. Not only can benzodiazepines treat withdrawal, it can also be life saving if delirium tremens occur frequently during withdrawal. Furthermore, benzodiazepines has also the capacity to alleviate cravings for alcohol in individuals who had resolved to lessen their intake of alcohol.
On the other hand, haloperidol, a kind of anti psychotic agent can also be effective in treating withdrawal especially in controlling agitation or psychosis, However, it may be possible that there can be worsening of the withdrawal effects since anti psychotics agents lowers the seizure threshold subjectively on some patients.
Topiramate carbamazepine and other anti-convulsants are used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal though it has not yet been fully proven with further research.
Other effective treatments include baclofen which is just as effective as diazepam, barbiturates are commonly used in severe cases, clonidine, flumazenil, trazadone, magnesium and even alcohol itself are also used. Vitamins are also recommended for patients by experts. It is also advised to refrain from smoking since smoking can interfere with the recovery of brain pathways of the patients.

DESCRIPTION
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative. Chemically, diazepam is 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a colorless to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water and has a molecular weight
of 284.74. Its structural formula is as follows:
Each tablet for oral administration contains 2 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg diazepam and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal
silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch and sodium lauryl sulfate. The following
coloring agents are employed:
2 mg - none
5 mg - FD&C Yellow #6
10 mg - FD&C Blue #1 and D&C Yellow #10
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus and hypothalamus, and induces calming effects.
Diazepam, unlike chlorpromazine and reserpine, has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor does it produce
extrapyramidal side effects; however, animals treated with diazepam do have a transient ataxia at higher doses. Diazepam was
found to have transient cardiovascular depressor effects in dogs. Long-term experiments in rats revealed no disturbances of
endocrine function.
Oral LD50 of diazepam is 720 mg/kg in mice and 1240 mg/kg in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 400 mg/kg to a monkey resulted
in death on the sixth day.
Reproduction Studies
A series of rat reproduction studies was performed with diazepam in oral doses of 1, 10, 80 and 100 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg there
was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and surviving offspring in these rats. Neonatal survival of rats at doses lower
than 100 mg/kg was within normal limits. Several neonates in these rat reproduction studies showed skeletal or other defects.
Further studies in rats at doses up to and including 80 mg/kg/day did not reveal teratological effects on the offspring.
In humans, measurable blood levels of diazepam were obtained in maternal and cord blood, indicating placental transfer of
the drug.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Diazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety
or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.
In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute
delirium tremens and hallucinosis.
Diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation
of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma); spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy
and paraplegia); athetosis; and stiffman syndrome.
Oral diazepam may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.
The effectiveness of diazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical
studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Diazepam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug and, because of lack of sufficient clinical
experience, in pediatric patients under 6 months of age. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving
appropriate therapy, but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.
WARNINGS
Diazepam is not of value in the treatment of psychotic patients and should not be employed in lieu of appropriate treatment.
As is true of most preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving diazepam should be cautioned against engaging
in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.
As with other agents which have anticonvulsant activity, when diazepam is used as an adjunct in treating convulsive disorders,
the possibility of an increase in the frequency and/or severity of grand mal seizures may require an increase in the dosage
of standard anticonvulsant medication. Abrupt withdrawal of diazepam in such cases may also be associated with a temporary
increase in the frequency and/or severity of seizures.
Since diazepam has a central nervous system depressant effect, patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion
of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam therapy.
Usage in Pregnancy
An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (diazepam, meprobamate and chlordiazepoxide)
during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter
of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of child-bearing potential
may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become
pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability
of discontinuing the drug.
Management of Overdosage
Manifestations of diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes. Respiration, pulse and
blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal
following overdosage. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids
should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol.
Dialysis is of limited value. As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that
multiple agents may have been ingested.
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative
effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior
to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous
access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients
treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects
for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine
users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior
to use.
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines. (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.)
PRECAUTIONS
If diazepam is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given
to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly with known compounds which may potentiate the action of diazepam,
such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants. The usual precautions are indicated
for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression; particularly the recognition
that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. The usual precautions in treating patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.
In elderly and debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude
the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2½ mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed
and tolerated).
The clearance of diazepam and certain other benzodiazepines can be delayed in association with cimetidine administration.
The clinical significance of this is unclear.
Information for Patients
To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce
psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the
dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue and ataxia. Infrequently encountered were confusion, constipation,
depression, diplopia, dysarthria, headache, hypotension, incontinence, jaundice, changes in libido, nausea, changes in salivation,
skin rash, slurred speech, tremor, urinary retention, vertigo and blurred vision. Paradoxical reactions such as acute hyperexcited
states, anxiety, hallucinations, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, rage, sleep disturbances and stimulation have been
reported; should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.
Because of isolated reports of neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during
long-term therapy. Minor changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during
and after diazepam therapy and are of no known significance.
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE
Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and
muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of diazepam. The more severe withdrawal
symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally
milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines
taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation
should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts
or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving diazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition
of such patients to habituation and dependence.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs
of most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to
avoid adverse effects.
ADULTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Management of Anxiety Disorders and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety: Depending upon severity of symptoms-2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal: 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed.
Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm: 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.
Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily.
Geriatric Patients, or in the Presence of Debilitating Disease: 2 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.
PEDIATRIC PATIENTS/USUAL DAILY DOSE
Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in
pediatric patients under 6 months—1 mg to 2 1/2 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.

Introduction
Probiotics are live microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) that are either the same as or similar to microorganisms found naturally in the human body and may be beneficial to health. Also referred to as ""good bacteria"" or ""helpful bacteria,"" probiotics are available to consumers in oral products such as dietary supplements and yogurts, as well as other products such as suppositories and creams. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any health claims for probiotics. This fact sheet provides a general overview of probiotics, with an emphasis on oral products, and suggests sources for additional information.

Key Points
Probiotic products are widely marketed, and consumer interest in probiotics is growing rapidly. Although some probiotic formulations have shown promise in research, strong scientific evidence to support specific uses of probiotics for most conditions is lacking.
Probiotics have potential applications in many areas of human health, and research to gather scientific evidence about whether and how they work is moving forward. Additional clinical studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of probiotics for specific uses.
If you are thinking about using a probiotic dietary supplementA product that contains vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, and/or other ingredients intended to supplement the diet. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has special labeling requirements for dietary supplements and treats them as foods, not drugs., consult your health care provider first. Probiotics—like any form of complementary medicine—should not be used in place of conventional medical care or to delay seeking care if you are experiencing symptoms that concern you.
Tell all your health care providers about any complementary approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care.

Background
The concept behind probiotics was introduced in the early 20th century, when Nobel laureate Elie Metchnikoff, known as the ""father of probiotics,"" proposed in The Prolongation of Life: Optimistic Studies that ingesting microorganisms could have substantial health benefits for humans. Microorganisms are invisible to the naked eye and exist virtually everywhere. Scientists continued to investigate the concept, and the term ""probiotics""—meaning ""for life""—eventually came into use.
Picturing the human body as a ""host"" for bacteria and other microorganisms is helpful in understanding probiotics. The body, especially the lower gastrointestinal tract (the gut), contains a complex and diverse community of bacteria. (In the body of a healthy adult, cells of microorganisms are estimated to outnumber human cells by a factor of ten to one.) Although we tend to think of bacteria as harmful ""germs,"" many bacteria actually help the body function properly. Most probiotics are bacteria similar to the beneficial bacteria found naturally in the human gut.
Various mechanisms may account for the effects of probiotics on human health. Possible mechanisms include altering the intestinal ""microecology"" (e.g., reducing harmful organisms in the intestine), producing antimicrobial compounds (substances that destroy or suppress the growth of microorganisms), and stimulating the body's immune response.
Probiotics commonly used in the United States include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. There are many specific types of bacteria within each of these two broad groups, and health benefits associated with one type may not hold true for others.
Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics
Probiotics are not the same as prebiotics—nondigestible substances that stimulate the growth and/or activity of potentially beneficial microorganisms. The term ""synbiotics"" refers to products that combine probiotics and prebiotics.
Top
Use of Probiotics in the United States
In the United States, probiotics are available as dietary supplements (including capsules, tablets, and powders) and in dairy foods (such as yogurts with live active cultures). According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, which included questions on Americans' use of natural products other than vitamins and minerals, ""prebiotics/probiotics"" ranked fifth among natural products used for children, but were not among the top-ranking products for adults. Although probiotic products are more popular in Europe and Japan than in the United States, the U.S. consumer market for probiotics is growing rapidly.
Although the FDA has not approved any health claims for probiotics, they are used for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions such as infectious diarrhea, diarrhea associated with using antibiotics, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). Probiotics are also being used for preventing tooth decay and for preventing or treating other oral health problems such as gingivitis and periodontitis. Some—but not all—probiotic formulations have been widely studied and show considerable promise. However, the rapid growth in marketing and consumer interest and use has outpaced scientific research on the safety and efficacy of probiotics for specific health applications.
Government Regulation of Probiotics
Government regulation of probiotics is complex. Depending on a probiotic product's intended use, the FDA might regulate it as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, or a drug. Many probiotic products are sold as dietary supplements, which do not require FDA approval prior to marketing. Dietary supplement labels may make claims about how the product affects the structure or function of the body without prior FDA approval, but they cannot make health claims (claims that the product reduces the risk of a disease) without the FDA's consent. (For more information about dietary supplements, see Using Dietary Supplements Wisely.) A product that is marketed as a drug must meet more stringent requirements. It must be proven safe and effective for its intended use through clinical studies (tests in people) and be approved by the FDA before it can be marketed.

Status of Probiotics Research
The potential of probiotics to benefit human health in many different ways has stimulated great interest and activity among researchers. For example, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Probiotic and Prebiotic Working Group, a trans-NIH effort to identify gaps and challenges in prebiotic/probiotic research.
Probiotic research is moving forward on two fronts: basic science (laboratory studies) and clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of probiotics for various medical conditions. Many early clinical trials of probiotics have had methodological limitations, and definitive clinical evidence to support using specific probiotic strains for specific health purposes is generally lacking. Nevertheless, there is preliminary evidence for several uses of probiotics, and more studies are under way. In particular, a recent review of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea concluded that there was evidence that probiotics can shorten the duration of diarrhea and reduce stool frequency but that more research was needed to establish exactly which probiotics should be used for which groups of people.
In 2008, the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases published a special issue on probiotics, which included an overview of clinical applications. Based on a review of selected studies, the authors classified several applications according to the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of probiotics in prevention and/or treatment. For example, the authors concluded that strong evidence exists for acute diarrhea and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and substantial evidence exists for atopic eczema (a skin condition most commonly seen in infants). Promising applications include childhood respiratory infections, tooth decay, nasal pathogens (bacteria harbored in the nose), gastroenteritis relapses caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria after antibiotic therapy, and inflammatory bowel disease. The authors also discussed various potential future applications.
Studies also indicate that probiotics may reduce side effects associated with treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection, the cause of most stomach ulcers. A systematic review suggests that there is strong evidence that probiotics may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a severe intestinal condition of premature newborns. Other potential future applications include use in reducing cholesterol levels, treating obesity, and managing irritable bowel syndrome.

Safety and Side Effects
It appears that most people can use probiotics without experiencing any side effects—or with only mild gastrointestinal side effects such as gas—but there have been some case reports of serious adverse effects, and research on safety is ongoing. A 2008 review of probiotics safety noted that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been widely studied in clinical trials for a variety of conditions and generally found to be safe. Nevertheless, a recent review of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium biology noted that long-term, cumulative effects of probiotics use, especially in children, are unknown, and also pointed to evidence that probiotics should not be used in critically ill patients. Similarly, a 2011 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality assessment of the safety of probiotics, partly funded by NCCAM, concluded that the current evidence does not suggest a widespread risk of negative side effects associated with probiotics. However, the data on safety, particularly long-term safety, are limited, and the risk of serious side effects may be greater in people who have underlying health conditions.
Concerns have also been raised about the quality of probiotic products. Some products have been found to contain smaller numbers of live microorganisms than expected. In addition, some products have been found to contain bacterial strains other than those listed as ingredients.

If You Are Thinking About Using Probiotics
Our understanding of probiotics is a work in progress. Although probiotic products are marketed for many different uses, scientific evidence supporting specific uses is still limited, and the FDA has not approved any health claims for probiotics. Before using probiotics, learn as much as you can by talking to your health care provider and researching reliable sources of information.
Different probiotic products may contain different types of probiotic bacteria. Different types of probiotic bacteria may have different effects in the human body, and effects also may vary from person to person.
Probiotics—or any form of complementary medicine—should not be used in place of conventional medical care or to delay seeking care if you are experiencing symptoms that concern you. If you are pregnant or nursing or are planning to give probiotics to a child, consulting your (or your child's) health care provider is especially important. Anyone with a serious underlying health problem should be monitored closely for potential negative side effects while taking probiotics.
Tell all your health care providers about any complementary and alternative approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. For tips on talking with your health care providers about complementary and alternative medicine, see NCCAM's Time to Talk campaign.

NCCAM-Funded Research on Probiotics
Recent NCCAM-supported research on probiotics has included clinical studies1 focused on:
Prevention and treatment of diarrhea in infants.
Potential benefits for adults and children with irritable bowel syndrome and for people with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (a complication of liver disease).
Treatment of an antibiotic-resistant type of bacteria.
Yogurt beverages as a way of giving high doses of probiotics to young children.
NCCAM also supports laboratory studies that explore possible mechanisms of action for probiotics, providing a foundation for clinical research. For example, recent studies have found evidence that a strain of Lactobacillus reuteri might slow the growth of certain tumors, and that Lactobacillus acidophilus might enhance the effects of a vaccine against rotavirus infection—the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in infants and children worldwide.
NCCAM's clinical research program has designated probiotics as a high-priority topic for upcoming projects. Studies will focus on probiotics for addressing gastrointestinal disorders in infants and children, including necrotizing enterocolitis, colic, and irritable bowel syndrome; treating and preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea; and enhancing the effects of flu vaccine.

Probiotics are live microorganisms thought to be beneficial to the host organism. According to the currently adopted definition by FAO/WHO, probiotics are: ""Live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host"". Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria are the most common types of microbes used as probiotics; but certain yeasts and bacilli may also be helpful. Probiotics are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods with specially added active live cultures; such as in yogurt, soy yogurt, or as dietary supplements.
Etymologically, the term appears to be a composite of the Latin preposition pro (""for"") and the Greek adjective βιωτικός (biotic), the latter deriving from the noun βίος (bios, ""life"").
At the start of the 20th century, probiotics were thought to beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance, thus inhibiting pathogens and toxin producing bacteria. Today, specific health effects are being investigated and documented including alleviation of chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, prevention and treatment of pathogen-induced diarrhea, urogenital infections, and atopic diseases.

History
The original observation of the positive role played by certain bacteria was first introduced by Russian scientist and Nobel laureate Eli Metchnikoff, who in the beginning of the 20th century suggested that it would be possible to modify the gut flora and to replace harmful microbes with useful microbes. Metchnikoff, at that time a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, produced the notion that the aging process results from the activity of putrefactive (proteolytic) microbes producing toxic substances in the large bowel. Proteolytic bacteria such as clostridia, which are part of the normal gut flora, produce toxic substances including phenols, indols and ammonia from the digestion of proteins. According to Metchnikoff these compounds were responsible for what he called ""intestinal auto-intoxication"", which caused the physical changes associated with old age.
It was at that time known that milk fermented with lactic-acid bacteria inhibits the growth of proteolytic bacteria because of the low pH produced by the fermentation of lactose. Metchnikoff had also observed that certain rural populations in Europe, for example in Bulgaria and the Russian steppes who lived largely on milk fermented by lactic-acid bacteria were exceptionally long lived. Based on these facts, Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk would ""seed"" the intestine with harmless lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal pH and that this would suppress the growth of proteolytic bacteria. Metchnikoff himself introduced in his diet sour milk fermented with the bacteria he called ""Bulgarian Bacillus"" and found his health benefited. Friends in Paris soon followed his example and physicians began prescribing the sour milk diet for their patients.
Bifidobacteria were first isolated from a breast-fed infant by Henry Tissier who also worked at the Pasteur Institute. The isolated bacterium named Bacillus bifidus communis was later renamed to the genus Bifidobacterium. Tissier found that bifidobacteria are dominant in the gut flora of breast-fed babies and he observed clinical benefits from treating diarrhea in infants with bifidobacteria. The claimed effect was bifidobacterial displacement of proteolytic bacteria causing the disease.
During an outbreak of shigellosis in 1917, German professor Alfred Nissle isolated a strain of Escherichia coli from the feces of a soldier who was not affected by the disease. Methods of treating infectious diseases were needed at that time when antibiotics were not yet available, and Nissle used the Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain in acute gastrointestinal infectious salmonellosis and shigellosis.
In 1920, Rettger demonstrated that Metchnikoff's ""Bulgarian Bacillus"", later called Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, could not live in the human intestine, and the fermented food phenomena petered out. Metchnikoff's theory was disputable (at this stage), and people doubted his theory of longevity.
After Metchnikoff's death in 1916, the centre of activity moved to the United States. It was reasoned that bacteria originating from the gut were more likely to produce the desired effect in the gut, and in 1935 certain strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were found to be very active when implanted in the human digestive tract. Trials were carried out using this organism, and encouraging results were obtained especially in the relief of chronic constipation.
The term ""probiotics"" was first introduced in 1953 by Kollath (see Hamilton-Miller et al. 2003). Contrasting antibiotics, probiotics were defined as microbially derived factors that stimulate the growth of other microorganisms. In 1989 Roy Fuller suggested a definition of probiotics which has been widely used: ""A live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance"". Fuller's definition emphasizes the requirement of viability for probiotics and introduces the aspect of a beneficial effect on the host.
In the following decades intestinal lactic acid bacterial species with alleged health beneficial properties have been introduced as probiotics, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus johnsonii.
Indications
Experiments into the benefits of probiotic therapies suggest a range of potentially beneficial medicinal uses for probiotics. For many of the potential benefits, research is limited and only preliminary results are available. It should be noted that the effects described are not general effects of probiotics. Recent research on the molecular biology and genomics of Lactobacillus has focused on the interaction with the immune system, anti-cancer potential, and potential as a biotherapeutic agent in cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, travellers' diarrhoea, pediatric diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
All effects can only be attributed to the individual strain(s) tested. Testing of a supplement does not indicate benefit from any other strain of the same species, and testing does not indicate benefit from the whole group of LAB (or other probiotics).
Diarrhea
Some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in preventing and treating various forms of gastroenteritis. They reduce both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) also reduce the duration of symptoms.
Antibiotic associated
Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) results from an imbalance in the colonic microbiota caused by antibiotic therapy. Microbiota alteration changes carbohydrate metabolism with decreased short-chain fatty acid absorption and an osmotic diarrhea as a result. Another consequence of antibiotic therapy leading to diarrhea is overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms such as Clostridium difficile.
Probiotic treatment can reduce the incidence and severity of AAD as indicated in several meta-analyses. However, further documentation of these findings through randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted.
Efficacy of probiotic AAD prevention is dependent on the probiotic strain(s) used and on the dosage. Up to a 50% reduction of AAD occurrence has been found. No side-effects have been reported in any of these studies. Caution should, however, be exercised when administering probiotic supplements to immunocompromised individuals or patients who have a compromised intestinal barrier.[citation needed]
Lactose intolerance
As lactic acid bacteria actively convert lactose into lactic acid, ingestion of certain active strains may help lactose intolerant individuals tolerate more lactose than they would have otherwise.
Preventing colon cancer
In laboratory investigations, some strains of LAB (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) have demonstrated anti-mutagenic effects thought to be due to their ability to bind with heterocyclic amines, which are carcinogenic substances formed in cooked meat. Animal studies have demonstrated that some LAB can protect against colon cancer in rodents, though human data is limited and conflicting. Most human trials have found that the strains tested may exert anti-carcinogenic effects by decreasing the activity of an enzyme called β-glucuronidase (which can generate carcinogens in the digestive system). Lower rates of colon cancer among higher consumers of fermented dairy products have been observed in one population study.
Lowering cholesterol
Animal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a range of LAB to be able to lower serum cholesterol levels, presumably by breaking down bile in the gut, thus inhibiting its reabsorption (which enters the blood as cholesterol). Some, but not all human trials have shown that dairy foods fermented with specific LAB can produce modest reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels in those with normal levels to begin with, however trials in hyperlipidemic subjects are needed.
Lowering blood pressure
Several small clinical trials have indicated that consumption of milk fermented with various strains of LAB may result in modest reductions in blood pressure. It is thought that this is due to the ACE inhibitor-like peptides produced during fermentation.
Improving immune function and preventing infections
LAB are thought to have several presumably beneficial effects on immune function. They may protect against pathogens by means of competitive inhibition (i.e., by competing for growth) and there is evidence to suggest that they may improve immune function by increasing the number of IgA-producing plasma cells, increasing or improving phagocytosis as well as increasing the proportion of T lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated that probiotics may decrease the incidence of respiratory tract infections and dental caries in children. LAB foods and supplements have been shown to aid in the treatment and prevention of acute diarrhea, and in decreasing the severity and duration of rotavirus infections in children and travelers' diarrhea in adults.
A 2010 study suggested that the anecdotal benefits of probiotic therapies as beneficial for preventing secondary infections, a common complication of antibiotic therapy, may be because keeping the immune system primed by eating foods enhanced with ""good"" bacteria may help counteract the negative effects of sickness and antibiotics. It was thought that antibiotics may turn the immune system ""off"" while probiotics turns it back on ""idle"", and more able to quickly react to new infections.
Helicobacter pylori
LAB are also thought to aid in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections (which cause peptic ulcers) in adults when used in combination with standard medical treatments. However more studies are required into this area.
Reducing inflammation
LAB and supplements have been found to modulate inflammatory and hypersensitivity responses, an observation thought to be at least in part due to the regulation of cytokine function. Clinical studies suggest that they can prevent reoccurrences of inflammatory bowel disease in adults, as well as improve milk allergies. They are not effective for treating eczema, a persistent skin inflammation. How probiotics counteract immune system overactivity remains unclear, but a potential mechanism is desensitization of T lymphocytes, an important component of the immune system, towards pro-inflammatory stimuli .
Improving mineral absorption
It is hypothesized that probiotic lactobacilli may help correct malabsorption of trace minerals, found particularly in those with diets high in phytate content from whole grains, nuts, and legumes.
Preventing harmful bacterial growth under stress
In a study done to see the effects of stress on intestinal flora, rats that were fed probiotics had little occurrence of harmful bacteria latched onto their intestines compared to rats that were fed sterile water.
Treating irritable bowel syndrome and colitis
B. infantis 35624, sold as Align, was found to improve some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in women in a recent study. Another probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, was also found to be effective in reducing IBS symptoms. Additionally, a probiotic formulation, VSL#3, was found to be safe in treating ulcerative colitis, though efficacy in the study was uncertain. Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 may help. For maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, Mutaflor (E.coli Nissle 1917) there are 3 controlled, randomized, double blind clinical studies which have proven equivalence of Mutaflor and mesalazine (5-ASAs).
Other
A study in 2004 testing the immune system of students given either milk or Actimel over a 6 week exam period (3 weeks of studying, 3 weeks of exams) tested 19 different biomarkers. Of these 19 biomarkers only 2 were shown to be different between the two groups, increased production of lymphocytes and increased production of CD56 cells. The tests were not blind and show that certain probiotic strains may have no overall effect on the immune system or on its ability.
A 2007 study at University College Cork in Ireland showed that a diet including milk fermented with Lactobacillus bacteria prevented Salmonella infection in pigs.
A 2007 clinical study at Imperial College London showed that preventive consumption of a commercially available probiotic drink containing L casei DN-114001, L bulgaricus, and S thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C difficile-associated diarrhea.
The efficacy and safety of a daily dose of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 in the prevention of AAD was demonstrated by Montreal’s Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, in a clinical study of hospitalized patients.
Current research is focusing on the molecular biology and genomics of Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria. The application of modern whole genome approaches is providing insights into bifidobacterial evolution, while also revealing genetic functions that explain their presence in the particular ecological environment of the gastrointestinal tract.
Probiotics are used in industry to improve yields of pork and chicken production.
Side effects
In some situations, such as where the person consuming probiotics is critically ill, probiotics could be harmful. In a therapeutic clinical trial conducted by the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group, the consumption of a mixture of six probiotic bacteria, increased the death rate of patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis.
In a clinical trial conducted at the University of Western Australia, aimed at showing the effectiveness of probiotics in reducing childhood allergies, Dr Susan Prescott and her colleagues gave 178 children either a probiotic or a placebo for the first six months of their life. Those given the good bacteria were more likely to develop a sensitivity to allergens.
Some hospitals have reported treating lactobacillus septicaemia, which is a potentially fatal disease caused by the consumption of probiotics by people with lowered immune systems or who are already very ill.
There is no published evidence that probiotic supplements are able to replace the body's natural flora when these have been killed off; indeed bacterial levels in feces disappear within days when supplementation ceases.
Probiotics taken orally can be destroyed by the acidic conditions of the stomach. A number of micro-encapsulation techniques are being developed to address this problem.
Recent studies indicate that probiotic products such as yogurts could be a cause for obesity trends. However, this is contested as the link to obesity and other health related issue with yogurt may link to its dairy attributes.
Some experts are skeptical on the efficacy of many strains and believe not all subjects will benefit from the use of probiotics. A criticism of probiotic supplements is the cost and value of probiotics products.
Strains
Live probiotic cultures are available in fermented dairy products and probiotic fortified foods. However, tablets, capsules, powders and sachets containing the bacteria in freeze dried form are also available.
Multi-probiotic
Research is emerging on the potential health benefits of multiple probiotic strains as a health supplement as opposed to a single strain. The human gut is home to some 400-500 types of microbes. It is thought that this diverse environment may benefit from multiple probiotic strains; different strains populate different areas of the digestive tract, and studies are beginning to link different probiotic strains to specific health benefits.
Incomplete list of supplement products that contain more than one probiotic strain.

Varicose Veins
What are varicose veins?
Varicose veins are enlarged veins that are visible through the skin and may appear as blue or purple twisted, knot-like cords. Varicose veins can occur anywhere in the body, but are more commonly found on the legs. Hemorrhoids, a type of varicose vein, can appear during pregnancy around the anus or in the vagina.
What are spider veins?
Spider veins, a milder type of varicose veins, are smaller than varicose veins and often look like a sunburst or ""spider web."" They are red or blue in color and are commonly found on the face and legs, just under the surface of the skin.
What causes varicose veins?
Click Image to Enlarge
Varicose veins are caused by increased blood pressure inside the superficial leg veins. Two main types of veins are present in the legs. Superficial veins are near the surface of the skin, whereas deep veins are located in the muscle tissue. Varicose veins occur in the superficial veins in the legs. In contrast, deep veins lead to the vena cava, a large vein that transports blood to the heart.
The blood in the veins of the legs works against gravity in order to return upwards to the heart. The blood is moved up towards the heart by one-way valves in the veins. When the leg muscles contract and squeeze the deep veins, the valves inside the veins open. When the leg muscles relax, the valves close, preventing blood from flowing backward.
When the one-way valves become weakened or damaged, blood can collect in the veins, causing the veins to become enlarged. Sitting or standing for long periods can cause blood to pool in the leg veins, increasing the pressure within the veins. In persons who are prone to varicose veins, the veins can stretch as a result of increased pressure. This stretching of the veins may weaken the walls of the veins and damage the valves. Thick varicose veins or spider veins may result.
Other factors that may lead to weakened vein valves and the development of varicose veins include obesity, aging, leg injury, pregnancy, smoking, hormones, and heredity (being born with weak vein valves). While varicose veins are not considered a severe medical condition, they can be uncomfortable and can lead to more serious problems such as phlebitis (inflammation in the leg) or blood clot. Varicose veins can also be a cosmetic concern to some people.
Click Image to Enlarge
Varicose veins are not generally linked to a serious condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT) because they occur in superficial veins. However, with severe varicose veins, there is a small increased chance of developing DVT. DVT requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms of DVT include sudden, severe leg swelling and can result in blood clots that travel to the brain or the heart. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute suggests that people seek immediate medical care if they have:
Increased warmth in one area of the leg that is also red or swollen
Pain or tenderness in the leg. This pain is felt only when you walk or stand.
Red or discolored skin on the affected leg
Swelling that occurs along a vein in the affected leg
Again, the chance of developing a DVT from varicose veins is very small, but--just in case--it is good to know its symptoms.
What are the symptoms of varicose veins?
The following are the most common symptoms of varicose veins. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Color changes in the skin
Sores on the legs
Rash
Sensations in the legs, such as a heavy feeling, burning, and/or aching
Severe varicose veins may eventually produce long-term mild swelling that can result in more serious skin and tissue problems, such as ulcers and nonhealing sores.
The symptoms of varicose veins may resemble other medical conditions or problems. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.
What are the risk factors for varicose veins?
The risk of varicose veins is strongly related to age and gender. The following are suggested risk factors for varicose veins:
Obesity. Obesity is a major risk factor for varicose veins. Excessive weight increases the pressure on the veins of the legs and aggravates the condition.
Family history. Heredity is important in determining susceptibility to varicose veins, but the specific factors responsible for this have not been identified.
Inactivity. Prolonged standing or sitting increases pressure in the veins.
Gender. Women are particularly susceptible to varicose veins because of the influence of progesterone on the veins and the effects of pregnancy. Women are 2-3 times more likely to have varicose veins.
Pregnancy. Pregnant women have an increased risk of developing varicose veins due to the hormonal influences of pregnancy on the veins, but the veins often return to normal within one year of childbirth. Women who have multiple pregnancies may develop permanent varicose veins.
Age. Varicose veins usually affect people between the ages of 30 and 70. With advancing age, the elastic shell of the vein begins to weaken increasing the chance that the vein will dilate.
A risk factor is anything that may increase a person's chance of developing a disease. It may be an activity, such as smoking, diet, family history, or many other things. Different diseases have different risk factors.
Although these risk factors increase a person's risk, they do not necessarily cause the disease. Some people with one or more risk factors never develop the disease, while others develop disease and have no known risk factors. But, knowing your risk factors to any disease can help to guide you into the appropriate actions, including changing behaviors and being clinically monitored for the disease.
How are varicose veins diagnosed?
In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination, diagnostic procedures for varicose veins may include any, or a combination, of the following:
Duplex ultrasound. A type of vascular ultrasound procedure done to assess blood flow and the structure of the leg veins. The term ""duplex"" refers to the fact that two modes of ultrasound are used--Doppler and B-mode. The B-mode transducer (like a microphone) obtains an image of the vessel being studied. The Doppler probe within the transducer evaluates the velocity and direction of blood flow in the vessel.
Color-flow imaging (also called triplex ultrasound). A procedure similar to duplex ultrasound that uses color to highlight the direction of blood flow. Vessels in which blood is flowing are colored red for flow in one direction and blue for flow in the other, with a color scale that reflects the speed of the flow.
Magnetic resonance venography (MRV). A diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of a large magnet, radiofrequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body. An MRV uses magnetic resonance technology and intravenous (IV) contrast dye to visualize the veins. Contrast dye causes the blood vessels to appear opaque on the X-ray image, allowing the doctor to visualize the blood vessels being evaluated. MRV is useful in some cases because it can help detect causes of leg pain other than vein problems.
What is the treatment for varicose veins?
Specific treatment for varicose veins will be determined by your doctor based on:
Your age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of the condition
Your signs and symptoms
Your tolerance of specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the condition
Your opinion or preference
Medical treatment may not be necessary if there are no symptoms. However, varicose veins may sometimes worsen without treatment. Treatment for varicose veins involves both surgical and nonsurgical approaches.
Nonsurgical methods for treating varicose veins include:
Elevation of the legs. You may be instructed to elevate your feet above the level of your heart three or four times a day for about 15 minutes at a time. If you need to sit or stand for a long period of time, flexing (bending) your legs occasionally can help keep blood circulating. If you have mild to moderate varicose veins, elevating your legs can help reduce leg swelling and relieve other symptoms.
Compression stockings. These elastic stockings squeeze or compress the veins and prevent blood from flowing backward. In addition, compression stockings may help with healing of skin sores and prevention of additional sores. Compression stockings are effective in treating varicose veins if worn daily and may prevent the need for more invasive treatment.
Sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy is the most common treatment for both spider and varicose veins. This procedure involves a saline or chemical solution that is injected into the varicose veins that causes them to harden so that they no longer fill with blood. Blood that would normally return to the heart through these veins returns to the heart by way of other veins. The veins that received the injection will eventually shrivel and disappear. The scar tissue is absorbed by the body.
Laser treatment. Laser treatment is a type of treatment for varicose veins. Until recently, laser treatment was mainly used for treatment of spider veins on the face. However, newer laser technology can now effectively treat varicose veins as well. There are several types of lasers that may be used to treat varicose veins. The doctor inserts a tiny fiber into a varicose vein through a catheter. The fiber sends out laser energy that destroys the diseased portion of your varicose vein. The vein closes and your body eventually absorbs it.
Ablation. Ablation involves the insertion of a thin, flexible tube called a catheter inserted into a varicose vein. The tip of the catheter heats the walls of the varicose vein and destroys the vein tissue. Once destroyed, the vein is no longer able to carry blood and is absorbed by your body.
Surgical approaches to the treatment of varicose veins include:
Vein stripping. This procedure involves tying off all varicose veins associated with the leg's main superficial vein and removing it from the leg. The removal of veins from the leg will not affect the blood circulation in the leg as deeper veins will be able to take care of the increased blood circulation.
Small incision avulsion. This procedure involves passing hooks through small incisions, and may be done alone or together with vein stripping.
Transilluminated powered phlebectomy. This vein removal procedure makes use of a bright light to illuminate the vein. A device is passed through a tiny incision and removes the vein with suction.
Can varicose veins be prevented?
Steps to prevent varicose veins include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and elevating the feet while sitting. Avoid clothing that constricts your waist, groin, or legs, shoes with high heels, and crossing the legs while sitting. While these measures may help prevent varicose veins in some people, they may only slow the onset of the condition in individuals who are susceptible.

Compression Stockings Cannot Cure Varicose Veins
Over 40 million men and women across the United States suffer varicose veins. Once regarded as a merely cosmetic problem, the medical community now recognizes varicose veins as a potentially serious medical issue. It is now understood that when left untreated varicose veins have the potential to cause life threatening complications. Many individuals living with varicose veins suffer from lifestyle limiting symptoms including pain, swelling, and fatigue. Varicose veins and their associated symptoms will often worsen without treatment.
Commonly, the first step in the treatment of varicose veins is the use of compression stockings. These medical grade elastic stockings provide the surface of the leg with an added layer of support and encourage circulation. Many insurance companies have adopted a policy requiring a period of wearing compression stockings to see if symptoms decrease before considering approval for any further treatments.
Unfortunately, compression stockings cannot cure varicose veins, nor will they prevent new varicose veins from forming. Compression stockings can only relieve, not repair, the effects of venous disorders. Even if symptoms are significantly reduced, stopping usage of the hose will cause them to return and the vein damage to progress.
For a long-term solution to eliminate the pain of varicose veins, contact The Vein Center at Virginia Surgical Associates to speak with a specialized vascular surgeon about the minimally invasive surgical options available. Contact us at (804) 477-8613 to learn more about compression stockings, permanent vein removal treatment options or to schedule an appointment
Please note: Compression stockings should only be worn when prescribed by a doctor. Fit and strength instructions should be followed to ensure effective treatment. Stockings purchased at a department store will not provide the accurate level of compression and will be ineffective in relieving symptoms.

Elastic compression support hose will make your legs search smoother and feel much better. They are the least invasive course of action for individuals with edema resulting from varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency. Support hose can assist promote circulation if they may be tighter in the ankles, progressively reducing the stress because they get higher up the leg. In the event the hose aren't fitted effectively they are able to worsen the problem of edema and cut off circulation. If you cannot find an excellent over-the-counter brand name, they are able to be medically prescribed.Elastic compression support hose assist avert legs from aching and swelling and retain blood from collecting in distended locations of the varicose veins. Circulation is elevated along with your legs will have a lot more power.Because workout does an outstanding task of contracting leg muscle groups to avoid fluid from gathering inside the legs, you may not want support hose during physical exercise. Sporting support hose whilst working out can cause overheating and block perspiration. Wear them only when standing or sitting for long intervals.Be aware that support stockings really are a temporary measure - as quickly because the support stockings arrive off, the veins will reappear along with the signs and symptoms may progressively worsen simply because support stockings tend not to cure varicose veins. Standard workout, elevating the legs and correct diet plan are nevertheless needed to improve circulation and prevent varicose veins from getting even worse.To assist decrease the signs and symptoms of varicose veins in a all-natural and much more everlasting way, you'll find lotions, lotions and tablets accessible that include herbs and crucial oils noted for his or her healing, circulation-enhancing, vaso-constricting and pain lowering attributes.By way of example, the effective herbal extract horse chestnut, based on the Mayo Clinic, can substantially minimize discomfort and varicose vein dimension and may possibly in fact be as effective a treatment as compression support stockings.

[ Physical Fitness ]
Staying healthy is important for people with epilepsy. Diet, physical fitness and sleep are all critical components in a healthy lifestyle.
Physical Fitness & Exercise
Leading an active life is good medicine for most people with epilepsy. If you find that getting overheated or physically tired triggers seizures, then you may want to avoid exercising when it's very hot. Take breaks when you feel you need them.
But if you are like most people with seizures, you will find that exercise is good for you in a number of ways. It makes you feel good and fights depression. It keeps your weight at reasonable levels so you look your best, and it builds self-confidence and self-esteem.
Find out more on our physical fitness and exercise page, including details about precautions for specific physical activities.
Diet and Eating Healthfully
In most cases, epilepsy isn't the kind of condition that can be treated with large doses of vitamins or mineral supplements. In fact, large quantities of either could be bad for your health. Check with your doctor before taking more vitamins than are in typical one-a-day multivitamins. If you are a woman who might become pregnant, ask your doctor about folic acid and how much you should be taking.
Eating a balanced diet is as important for you as it is for everyone else. However, if you think you are overweight, don't go on a crash diet without checking with your doctor first.
Sleep
Most people who have epilepsy need about the same amount of sleep as everybody else. There's usually no need to take extra naps or to go to bed early.
However, all-night study sessions, a series of late nights, or an overall lack of sleep can greatly raise the risk of seizures. In fact, that's one reason why doctors often ask adults or children suspected of having epilepsy to stay up late the night before an EEG examination. The lack of sleep increases the chances of seizure activity showing up on the tests. Another reason is to increase the chances that you will sleep during part of the EEG. Some seizure patterns are much more common in sleep than while awake.
On the other hand, people with epilepsy should not feel they need an excessive amount of sleep. If you feel tired and sleepy all the time, chances are your medicine needs adjustment in some way, or you may be depressed. Perhaps your dose is too high, or you are taking it at the wrong time of day. Don't make changes yourself, though. Tell your doctor about it.

Other Cases
Carbamazepine and Open Neural Tube Defect- a case of anti-epileptic
drug induced teratogenecity
Case report:
A 25 year old female patient G3 P2 A1 L1with a history of epilepsy
of 3 years duration presented to Therapeutic Drug Monitoring OPD of
KEM hospital for estimation of serum carbamazepine (CBZ) levels. Patient
was diagnosed as a case of neurocysticercosis in December 2001 and was
taking CBZ in the dose of 200 mg thrice daily since then. While on therapy
the patient conceived in the month of November 2003. During pregnancy,
CBZ was advised in the same dose after weighing the risk and benefits
of antiepileptic therapy along with 5mg of folic acid per day and patient
was informed about the risks.
The patient did not follow up subsequently and directly presented at
the 8 months of gestation. Ultrasonography done at that time showed
the fetus to have Arnold Chiari malformation. The patient delivered
a male child on 23/09/04 by lower segment cesarean section (LSCS). The
newborn weighed 2.45 kg with Total Length (TL) of 49cm and Head Circumference
(HC) of 32 cm. On examination, child was noted to have a 4cm x 4 cm
open neural tube defect in lumbar region with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
leak and bowel bladder incontinence. There was no associated craniofacial
or finger nail malformation.
In the mother, prenatal serum CBZ (9.24 mg/ml) and CBZ epoxide (2.53)
levels were within therapeutic range. (The therapeutic range of CBZ
being 4 mg/ml to 12 mg/ml.) After 15 days of delivery serum CBZ levels
for mother were 15.24 mg/ml and CBZ epoxide levels were 2.62 mg/ml while
for the child CBZ levels were 1.93 mg/ml and CBZ epoxide was not measurable.
Parents refused neurosurgical intervention in view of guarded prognosis
and patient was discharged home on 17/09/04.
Eight years prior the patient had delivered a female child, when she
was not on CBZ therapy and the child was born without any congenital
anomalies.
Discussion
Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an iminostilbene derivative chemically related
to tricyclic antidepressants. CBZ is used as an antiepileptic in treatment
of generalized tonic clonic seizures as well as simple and complex partial
seizures. It is also used for patients with manic-depressive illness,
postherpetic and trigeminal neuralgia and phantom limb pain (1).
Infants of epileptic mothers are at two-fold greater risk of major congenital
malformations than offsprings of nonepileptic mothers that is 4% to
8% compared to 2% to 4%. These malformations include congenital heart
defects, open neural tube defects, craniofacial abnormalities and others.
Common teratogenic effects of CBZ include small head circumference,
finger and toe nail hypoplasia, craniofacial defects, mild mental retardation
and developmental delay (2). Incidence
of Neural tube defect in general population is 0.1% where as exposure
to CBZ in utero without concurrent exposure to valproic acid carries
1% risk of neural tube defect (10 times that of general population)
(3).
Causal role for anticonvulsants in congenital malformations is suggested
by association of congenital defects with higher concentration of the
drug or polytherapy as compared to monotherapy (1)
One possible factor is decreased activity of the enzyme epoxide hydrolase
with resulting increased concentration of CBZ epoxide, which may be
teratogenic (4).
Also in pregnancy, metabolism of carbamazepine is increased so that
increased epoxide metabolites are generated and these epoxide radicals
are known to be teratogenic. Lymphocyte toxicity test is done to evaluate
the epoxide hydrolase status of the patient. However this test could
not be performed in the patient.
During pregnancy, risks and benefits of antiepileptic therapy should
be weighed carefully as discontinuation of treatment itself may pose
risk to mother as well as fetus. Current guidelines suggest use of a
single antiepileptic drug with the lowest effective dose and frequent
monitoring of serum levels. The incidence of teratogenicity with Primidone
is highest (14.3 %) followed by valproate (11.1%), phenytoin (9.1%),
carbamazepine (5.7%) and phenobarbital (5.1%) (5).
Adequate prepregnancy councelling is essential for women who have epilepsy.
Women who become pregnant should be advised of the availability of noninvasive
screening tests and invasive diagnostic tests for congenital birth defects
(including NTDs). Procedures for prenatal diagnosis include: (i) assessment
of serum markers such as maternal serum alpha-foetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase
activity at 15 to 20 weeks; (ii) prenatal Ultrasonography at 16 to 20
weeks; and (iii) amniocentesis after 15 weeks of pregnancy if a positive
screening test is present. The levels of these two serum markers are
increased in neural tube defects and a value of more than two multiples
of the median is considered significant. Detailed counseling of the
couple needs to be an integral part of the prenatal screening programme
(6, 7)
Women in intermediate- to high-risk categories for NTDs (NTD-affected
previous pregnancy, family history, insulin-dependent diabetes, epilepsy
treatment with valproic acid or carbamazepine) should be advised high-dose
folic acid (4.0 mg-5.0 mg daily) supplementation. This should be taken
as folic acid alone, not in a multivitamin format, due to risk of excessive
intake of other vitamins such as vitamin A (8)

I'm a Journalist and I Would Like to Schedule an Interview
I'm a Consumer and I Would Like More Information on this Topic

Page BodyCOLUMBUS, Ohio – It was a patient’s tearful story that convinced Lucretia Long to try to raise awareness about the health issues surrounding women with epilepsy.“I had a new patient diagnosed with epilepsy who had been seizure-free for years who told me she could never become pregnant, when in fact we know that 95 percent of epilepsy patients can have successful pregnancies,” recalled Long, an epilepsy nurse practitioner at The Ohio State University Medical Center. “That patient now has two healthy children.”It turns out that Long’s patient was not alone in her misconceptions about the perceived limitations of her condition. And, Long and colleagues have found, the knowledge gaps among women with epilepsy might be due in part to a lack of awareness about their specific health concerns among primary care practitioners.Long led a study surveying 202 primary care physicians attending an annual conference to gauge their knowledge of women’s issues and epilepsy. The researchers reported that few of the physicians surveyed understood that hormonal fluctuations during a woman’s menstrual cycle can affect seizure frequency, and most were unfamiliar with the strong association between epilepsy and increased incidence of female sexual dysfunction. Though at least three-fourths of those surveyed knew that women with epilepsy can have healthy pregnancies, fewer than half knew that women taking anti-seizure medications could safely breastfeed their babies. The results were published in a recent issue of the journal Epilepsy & Behavior.“This is important because we know women with epilepsy often seek primary care practitioners, at least initially, for evaluation and treatment,” said Long, also a clinical assistant professor in OSU’s department of neurology. “I believe primary care practitioners have such a broad range of patients with such a variety of diagnoses that many just haven’t had the opportunity to become aware of issues specific to women with epilepsy.“The good news is the overwhelming majority of those surveyed were very interested in learning more about epilepsy, so we are hopeful that as a result of this survey, we can develop educational interventions to facilitate an increase in knowledge.”Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally, causing strange sensations, emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. More than 2 million people in the United States have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques.Other findings among the health care providers surveyed included:* One in four didn’t understand that a pregnant woman with epilepsy should continue taking antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy. * Ninety-two percent were aware of the value of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, but only 68 percent recognized the need for vitamin K supplementation during the last month of pregnancy to reduce the risk of neonatal hemorrhagic disorder associated with certain anticonvulsants. * Only about 70 percent knew that certain antiepileptic drugs might interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives or increase the risk of diseases associated with bone weakness.Long and colleagues noted that the ideal health care practices for women with epilepsy would include ensuring that oral contraception for women on antiepileptic drugs have adequate amounts of estrogen to boost their effectiveness and advising women on antiepileptic drugs to take vitamin D and calcium supplements to protect their bone health.Long recommended the following steps for women with epilepsy who wish to have children: Pursue prepregnancy counseling; plan for folic acid supplementation before pregnancy; consider an attempt to reduce medication before pregnancy if possible; and assess seizure medication drug levels every three months during pregnancy to see if medication doses should be adjusted.“We always think it’s a good idea for at least one evaluation with a neurologist or epilepsy specialist once you become pregnant to establish a plan of care,” Long said.Long noted that epilepsy in general does not receive the visibility it warrants. In a previous study assessing epilepsy patients’ own knowledge of their disorder, Long and colleagues found that in general, patients with epilepsy are not knowledgeable about their disorder, regardless of age, educational background or number of years with epilepsy. “Education is obviously needed for the patient population, as well,” Long said. “Our job as health care providers is to give patients information they need to live with this condition every day.”# # #Emily CaldwellMedical Center Communications614.293.3737emily.caldwell@osumc.edu

Phenytoin
Co-Existing Disorders > Cerebrovascular Disease > Treatment of seizures > Phenytoin
Author: EB Bromfield and GV Henderson
Because of its relative lack of sedation and ease of loading by a parenteral route, the mainstay of acute seizure treatment in the United States remains phenytoin, although it is not clearly efficacious in all circumstances (e.g., hypoglycemia or alcohol withdrawal).
The recent availability of fosphenytoin provides more flexibility, mainly by allowing intramuscular administration to those without adequate intravenous access. Although fosphenytoin can be given more quickly intravenously than phenytoin, adequate brain phenytoin levels may not be achieved with significantly more speed because of the time taken to dephosphorylate the molecule. Fosphenytoin is dosed in phenytoin equivalents, rather than in actual quantities of fosphenytoin itself.
In the inpatient setting, typically some or all of the loading dose is given parenterally. Although the familiar �gram of phenytoin� is adequate for loading in a patient who has had a single seizure, in treating convulsive status epilepticus, the target level should be in the range of 20�25 mg/liter, and so a loading dose of 18�20 mg/kg (keeping in mind that volume of distribution in adults is 0.8 mg/liter) should be given at the maximal rate of 50 mg per minute of phenytoin or 150 mg per minute of fosphenytoin (in phenytoin equivalents).101 Because of the possibility of decreases in pulse rate and blood pressure, cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory, sometimes necessitating a slower rate of infusion, administration of fluids, or, less commonly, pressors. Monitoring of vital signs is particularly important in stroke patients, who are usually elderly and often have cardiac disease.
Because of the slow absorption of phenytoin 100-mg or 30-mg extended-release capsules, oral loading is affected by metabolism and the dose to obtain a given peak level must be higher, approximately 1 mg/kg for each desired 1 mg/liter rise in level.
Peak oral level is reached more quickly if the 50-mg chewable tablet is used. This preparation, which contains the acid form rather than the sodium salt, has a slightly higher amount of phenytoin than does the equivalent dose of phenytoin sodium capsules.
The 125 mg/5 mL suspension also contains the acid form. It may be convenient to use in patients receiving tube feedings. Unless this preparation is vigorously shaken, however, the phenytoin may precipitate in the bottom of the bottle, yielding doses that are lower (if from the full bottle) or higher (if from the bottom of the bottle) than intended.
Important interactions with other drugs follow from two characteristics of phenytoin:
It is highly protein bound, so that mutual displacement from binding sites occurs with several other drugs, most notably aspirin.
It is a potent inducer of the P-450 mixed-function oxidase hepatic enzyme system responsible for the metabolism of many important drugs. (In stroke patients, the most important of these drugs is warfarin.) When phenytoin is added to these drugs, their doses typically must be increased if the therapeutic effect is to remain constant. Careful monitoring is needed of levels, therapeutic effects (e.g., prothrombin time), or both. This interaction takes several days to develop fully. Conversely, when phenytoin is withdrawn, the warfarin dose must be reduced and prothrombin times followed closely. Other drugs frequently used in stroke patients whose metabolism is induced by phenytoin (or other enzyme-inducing AEDs, including phenobarbital and carbamazepine) include digoxin, many anti-arrhythmic agents, and beta-blockers.
The situation most commonly necessitating phenytoin discontinuation is the development of a rash, which occurs in 5�10% of patients, or less common idiosyncratic reactions, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatic dysfunction, or a combination of these. Although the rash may resolve even without discontinuation, most clinicians elect not to continue treatment. One must recognize, however, that in elderly patients, who often take a number of medications, many other drugs, particularly antibiotics, can also cause rash.
There is no evidence that sudden discontinuation of phenytoin causes withdrawal seizures, but if it is needed for seizure control, prudence dictates coverage with adequate doses of an alternative AED when phenytoin is withdrawn. The two most commonly used alternatives, phenobarbital and carbamazepine, may cause cross-reactivity allergic reactions as often as 20% of the time. If the reaction is not severe, this risk may be reasonable.
Dose-related side effects primarily include dizziness and ataxia; chronic effects include gum hyperplasia (more common in children), and osteopenia, mediated largely but not completely through interference with vitamin D metabolism. This is a particular concern in older women, who should be considered for bone density screening, vitamin D supplementation, and other medical therapy if long-term treatment is anticipated.
With respect to cognitive effects, no major differences have been found among phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate.104,105 (Phenobarbital is likely to have more detrimental effects, on average.) Further studies are needed to establish whether newer AEDs have less effect on cognition than phenytoin and the other older AEDs.

Folate: What is it?
Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that occurs naturally in food. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate that is found in supplements and added to fortified foods [1].
Folate gets its name from the Latin word ""folium"" for leaf. A key observation of researcher Lucy Wills nearly 70 years ago led to the identification of folate as the nutrient needed to prevent the anemia of pregnancy. Dr. Wills demonstrated that the anemia could be corrected by a yeast extract. Folate was identified as the corrective substance in yeast extract in the late 1930s, and was extracted from spinach leaves in 1941.
Folate helps produce and maintain new cells [2]. This is especially important during periods of rapid cell division and growth such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate is needed to make DNA and RNA, the building blocks of cells. It also helps prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer [3]. Both adults and children need folate to make normal red blood cells and prevent anemia [4]. Folate is also essential for the metabolism of homocysteine, and helps maintain normal levels of this amino acid.
What foods provide folate?
Leafy green vegetables (like spinach and turnip greens), fruits (like citrus fruits and juices), and dried beans and peas are all natural sources of folate [5].
In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products [6][7][8][9]. Since cereals and grains are widely consumed in the U.S., these products have become a very important contributor of folic acid to the American diet. The following table suggests a variety of dietary sources of folate.
Table 1: Selected Food Sources of Folate and Folic Acid [10]
Items marked with an asterisk (*) are fortified with folic acid as part of the Folate Fortification Program.
^ DV = Daily Value. DVs are reference numbers developed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help consumers determine if a food contains a lot or a little of a specific nutrient. The DV for folate is 400 micrograms (μg). Most food labels do not list a food's magnesium content. The percent DV (%DV) listed on the table indicates the percentage of the DV provided in one serving. A food providing 5% of the DV or less is a low source while a food that provides 10-19% of the DV is a good source. A food that provides 20% or more of the DV is high in that nutrient. It is important to remember that foods that provide lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. For foods not listed in this table, please refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrient Database Web site: http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl.
What are the Dietary Reference Intakes for folate?
Recommendations for folate are given in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences [11]. Dietary Reference Intakes is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intake for healthy people. Three important types of reference values included in the DRIs are Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), Adequate Intakes (AI), and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL). The RDA recommends the average daily intake that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals in each age and gender group [12].. An AI is set when there is insufficient scientific data available to establish a RDA. AIs meet or exceed the amount needed to maintain a nutritional state of adequacy in nearly all members of a specific age and gender group. The UL, on the other hand, is the maximum daily intake unlikely to result in adverse health effects [13].
The RDAs for folate are expressed in a term called the Dietary Folate Equivalent. The Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) was developed to help account for the differences in absorption of naturally occurring dietary folate and the more bioavailable synthetic folic acid [14][15]. Table 2 lists the RDAs for folate, expressed in micrograms (μg) of DFE, for children and adults [16]..
Table 2: Recommended Dietary Allowances for Folate for Children and Adults [17].
1 DFE = 1 μg food folate = 0.6 μg folic acid from supplements and fortified foods
There is insufficient information on folate to establish an RDA for infants. An Adequate Intake (AI) has been established that is based on the amount of folate consumed by healthy infants who are fed breast milk [18].. Table 3 lists the Adequate Intake for folate, in micrograms (μg), for infants.
Table 3: Adequate Intake for folate for infants [19].

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988-94) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-96 CSFII) indicated that most individuals surveyed did not consume adequate folate [20][21]. However, the folic acid fortification program, which was initiated in 1998, has increased folic acid content of commonly eaten foods such as cereals and grains, and as a result most diets in the United States (US) now provide recommended amounts of folate equivalents [22].
When can folate deficiency occur?
A deficiency of folate can occur when an increased need for folate is not matched by an increased intake, when dietary folate intake does not meet recommended needs, and when folate loss increases. Medications that interfere with the metabolism of folate may also increase the need for this vitamin and risk of deficiency [23][24][25][26][27][28].
Medical conditions that increase the need for folate or result in increased loss of folate include:
pregnancy and lactation (breastfeeding)
alcohol abuse
malabsorption
kidney dialysis
liver disease
certain anemias
Medications that interfere with folate utilization include:
anticonvulsant medications (such as dilantin, phenytoin and primidone)
metformin (sometimes prescribed to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes)
sulfasalazine (used to control inflammation associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
triamterene (a diuretic)
methotrexate (used for cancer and other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis)
barbiturates (used as sedatives)
What are some common signs and symptoms of folate deficiency?
Folate deficient women who become pregnant are at greater risk of giving birth to low birth weight, premature, and/or infants with neural tube defects.
In infants and children, folate deficiency can slow overall growth rate.
In adults, a particular type of anemia can result from long term folate deficiency.
Other signs of folate deficiency are often subtle. Digestive disorders such as diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss can occur, as can weakness, sore tongue, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, forgetfulness, and behavioral disorders [29][30]. An elevated level of homocysteine in the blood, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, also can result from folate deficiency.
Many of these subtle symptoms are general and can also result from a variety of medical conditions other than folate deficiency. It is important to have a physician evaluate these symptoms so that appropriate medical care can be given.
Do women of childbearing age and pregnant women have a special need for folate?
Folic acid is very important for all women who may become pregnant. Adequate folate intake during the periconceptual period, the time just before and just after a woman becomes pregnant, protects against neural tube defects [31]. Neural tube defects result in malformations of the spine (spina bifida), skull, and brain (anencephaly) [32]. The risk of neural tube defects is significantly reduced when supplemental folic acid is consumed in addition to a healthful diet prior to and during the first month following conception [33][34][35]. Since January 1, 1998, when the folate food fortification program took effect, data suggest that there has been a significant reduction in neural tube birth defects [36]. Women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or take a folic acid supplement in addition to eating folate-rich foods to reduce the risk of some serious birth defects. For this population, researchers recommend a daily intake of 400 μg of synthetic folic acid per day from fortified foods and/or dietary supplements [37].
Who else may need extra folic acid to prevent a deficiency?
People who abuse alcohol, those taking medications that may interfere with the action of folate (including, but not limited to those listed above), individuals diagnosed with anemia from folate deficiency, and those with malabsorption, liver disease, or who are receiving kidney dialysis treatment may benefit from a folic acid supplement.
Folate deficiency has been observed in alcoholics. A 1997 review of the nutritional status of chronic alcoholics found low folate status in more than 50% of those surveyed [38]. Alcohol interferes with the absorption of folate and increases the amount of folate the kidney gets rid of. In addition, many people who abuse alcohol have poor quality diets that do not provide the recommended intake of folate [39]. Increasing folate intake through diet, or folic acid intake through fortified foods or supplements, may be beneficial to the health of alcoholics.
Anti-convulsant medications such as dilantin increase the need for folate [40][41]. Anyone taking anti-convulsants and other medications that interfere with the body's ability to use folate should consult with a medical doctor about the need to take a folic acid supplement [42][43][44].
Anemia is a condition that occurs when there is insufficient hemoglobin in red blood cells to carry enough oxygen to cells and tissues. It can result from a wide variety of medical problems, including folate deficiency. With folate deficiency, your body may make large red blood cells that do not contain adequate hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's cells [45]. Your physician can determine whether an anemia is associated with folate deficiency and whether supplemental folic acid is indicated.
Several medical conditions increase the risk of folic acid deficiency. Liver disease and kidney dialysis increase the loss of folic acid. Malabsorption can prevent your body from using folate in food. Medical doctors treating individuals with these disorders will evaluate the need for a folic acid supplement [46].
What are some current issues and controversies about folate?
Folic Acid and Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease involves any disorder of the heart and blood vessels that make up the cardiovascular system. Coronary heart disease occurs when blood vessels which supply the heart become clogged or blocked, increasing the risk of a heart attack. Vascular damage can also occur to blood vessels supplying the brain, and can result in a stroke.
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in industrialized countries such as the US, and is on the rise in developing countries. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health has identified many risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including an elevated LDL-cholesterol level, high blood pressure, a low HDL-cholesterol level, obesity, and diabetes [47]. In recent years, researchers have identified another risk factor for cardiovascular disease, an elevated homocysteine level. Homocysteine is an amino acid normally found in blood, but elevated levels have been linked with coronary heart disease and stroke [48][49][50]. Elevated homocysteine levels may impair endothelial vasomotor function, which determines how easily blood flows through blood vessels [51]. High levels of homocysteine also may damage coronary arteries and make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot, which may lead to a heart attack [52].
A deficiency of folate, vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 may increase blood levels of homocysteine, and folate supplementation has been shown to decrease homocysteine levels and to improve endothelial function [53][54][55]. At least one study has linked low dietary folate intake with an increased risk of coronary events [56]. The folic acid fortification program in the U. S. has decreased the prevalence of low levels of folate and high levels of homocysteine in the blood in middle-aged and older adults [57]. Daily consumption of folic-acid fortified breakfast cereal and the use of folic acid supplements has been shown to be an effective strategy for reducing homocysteine concentrations [58].
Evidence supports a role for supplemental folic acid for lowering homocysteine levels, however this does not mean that folic acid supplements will decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical intervention trials are underway to determine whether supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 can lower risk of coronary heart disease. It is premature to recommend folic acid supplementation for the prevention of heart disease until results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials positively link increased folic acid intake with decreased homocysteine levels AND decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Folic Acid and Cancer
Some evidence associates low blood levels of folate with a greater risk of cancer [59]. Folate is involved in the synthesis, repair, and function of DNA, our genetic map, and there is some evidence that a deficiency of folate can cause damage to DNA that may lead to cancer [60]. Several studies have associated diets low in folate with increased risk of breast, pancreatic, and colon cancer [61][62]. Over 88,000 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study who were free of cancer in 1980 were followed from 1980 through 1994. Researchers found that women ages 55 to 69 years in this study who took multivitamins containing folic acid for more than 15 years had a markedly lower risk of developing colon cancer [63]. Findings from over 14,000 subjects followed for 20 years suggest that men who do not consume alcohol and whose diets provide the recommended intake of folate are less likely to develop colon cancer [64]. However, associations between diet and disease do not indicate a direct cause. Researchers are continuing to investigate whether enhanced folate intake from foods or folic acid supplements may reduce the risk of cancer. Until results from such clinical trials are available, folic acid supplements should not be recommended to reduce the risk of cancer.
Folic Acid and Methotrexate for Cancer
Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide [65]. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. Methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it limits the activity of enzymes that need folate.
Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that may make it difficult to eat normally [66][67][68]. Leucovorin is a form of folate that can help ""rescue"" or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate [69]. There are many studies underway to determine if folic acid supplements can help control the side effects of methotrexate without decreasing its effectiveness in chemotherapy [70][71]. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow a medical doctor's advice on the use of folic acid supplements.
Folic Acid and Methotrexate for Non-Cancerous Diseases
Low dose methotrexate is used to treat a wide variety of non-cancerous diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, asthma, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and inflammatory bowel disease [72]. Low doses of methotrexate can deplete folate stores and cause side effects that are similar to folate deficiency. Both high folate diets and supplemental folic acid may help reduce the toxic side effects of low dose methotrexate without decreasing its effectiveness [63-64]. Anyone taking low dose methotrexate for the health problems listed above should consult with a physician about the need for a folic acid supplement.
Caution About Folic Acid Supplements
Beware of the interaction between vitamin B12 and folic acid
Intake of supplemental folic acid should not exceed 1,000 micrograms (μg) per day to prevent folic acid from triggering symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency [73]. Folic acid supplements can correct the anemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Unfortunately, folic acid will not correct changes in the nervous system that result from vitamin B12 deficiency. Permanent nerve damage can occur if vitamin B12 deficiency is not treated.
It is very important for older adults to be aware of the relationship between folic acid and vitamin B12 because they are at greater risk of having a vitamin B12 deficiency. If you are 50 years of age or older, ask your physician to check your B12 status before you take a supplement that contains folic acid. If you are taking a supplement containing folic acid, read the label to make sure it also contains B12 or speak with a physician about the need for a B12 supplement.
What is the health risk of too much folic acid?
Folate intake from food is not associated with any health risk. The risk of toxicity from folic acid intake from supplements and/or fortified foods is also low [74]. It is a water soluble vitamin, so any excess intake is usually lost in the urine. There is some evidence that high levels of folic acid can provoke seizures in patients taking anti-convulsant medications [75]. Anyone taking such medications should consult with a medical doctor before taking a folic acid supplement.
The Institute of Medicine has established a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for folate from fortified foods or supplements (i.e. folic acid) for ages one and above. Intakes above this level increase the risk of adverse health effects. In adults, supplemental folic acid should not exceed the UL to prevent folic acid from triggering symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency [76]. It is important to recognize that the UL refers to the amount of synthetic folate (i.e. folic acid) being consumed per day from fortified foods and/or supplements. There is no health risk, and no UL, for natural sources of folate found in food. Table 4 lists the Upper Intake Levels (UL) for folate, in micrograms (μg), for children and adults.

Selecting a healthful diet
As the 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans states, ""Different foods contain different nutrients and other healthful substances. No single food can supply all the nutrients in the amounts you need"" [77]. As indicated in Table 1, green leafy vegetables, dried beans and peas, and many other types of vegetables and fruits provide folate. In addition, fortified foods are a major source of folic acid. It is not unusual to find foods such as some ready-to-eat cereals fortified with 100% of the RDA for folate. The variety of fortified foods available has made it easier for women of childbearing age in the US to consume the recommended 400 mcg of folic acid per day from fortified foods and/or supplements [78]. The large numbers of fortified foods on the market, however, also raises the risk of exceeding the UL. This is especially important for anyone at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be triggered by too much folic acid. It is important for anyone who is considering taking a folic acid supplement to first consider whether their diet already includes adequate sources of dietary folate and fortified food sources of folic acid.
For more information about building a healthful diet, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2000/2000DGProfessionalBooklet.pdf) [66] and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Guide Pyramid (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.html) [79].

Growth retardation is common among children with epilepsy, and poor dietary intake may be one of the causes. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to compare the nutrient intake of children 1 to 8 years of age with intractable epilepsy to healthy children of the same age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001 to 2002 (N=1,718) and with the Dietary Reference Intakes. Children with intractable epilepsy were divided into two age groups: 1.0 to 3.9 and 4.0 to 8.9 years, to correspond with the Dietary Reference Intakes. Forty-three children with intractable epilepsy, mean age=4.7+/-2.2 years, had significantly lower intakes (P<0.05) of total energy; protein; carbohydrate; fat; dietary fiber; vitamins A, E, B-6, and B-12; riboflavin; niacin; folate; calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; zinc; copper; and selenium compared with healthy children. Thirty percent or more of the children with intractable epilepsy in both age groups had intakes below the Recommended Dietary Allowance or Adequate Intake for vitamins D, E, and K; folate; calcium; linoleic acid; and alpha-linolenic acid. Health care professionals caring for children with intractable epilepsy should be aware of this pattern of decreased nutrient intake and educate families to provide an adequate diet and/or consider vitamin/mineral supplementation.

Which Foods Have Vitamin E
Submitted By: Mark Monteiro in Health Tips category
You can find Vitamin E naturally in some foods, added to others and is also available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin E is the combined name for a group of fat soluble compounds with characteristic antioxidant activities. If you wonder which foods have Vitamin E, then the following points would clear all your questions or doubts.
It’s important that you eat plenty of foods with Vitamin E in order to balance your nutritional intake and meet your body’s needs. There are several people who frequently ignore several minerals and vitamins that they need to take it on a daily basis as they are too concerned about their calories, fat, carbohydrate and protein intake.
Importance of Vitamin E
It’s vital that apart from monitoring your macronutrient and calorie intake, you should also give importance to your micronutrient intake as well as it’s vital for your health’s success. That’s where foods containing Vitamin E come into picture. Getting high adequate amounts of Vitamin E is extremely critical to your well being as it is a fat soluble vitamin that has essential role to play in the body.
You can start to become deficient by overlooking eating Vitamin E foods which could also lead to several health problems in the future.
Foods Containing Vitamin E
Learning which foods have vitamin E and including them in your diet regularly would make meeting your daily requirements extremely easy. The top foods containing Vitamin E are: Swiss chard, mustard greens, sunflower seeds, spinach, almonds, dry roasted, turnip greens, collard greens, olives, papaya and kale.
You can easily meet your full daily intake and don’t have to depend on any supplements for this vital vitamin if you eat a salad made with spinach and sprinkle some sunflower seeds and slivered almonds on top. These are some vital foods that you would like to know containing Vitamin E. You can miss on this fat soluble vitamin if you’re consuming an ultra low fat diet, thus something important to consider.
Health Benefits of Vitamin E
Adding more Vitamin E foods to your diet can benefit you immensely, if you’re suffering from a wide variety of health conditions. However, it’s recommended to speak with a health professional before doing so. The conditions that could be benefited by incorporating Vitamin E foods in to your diet are: asthma, atherosclerosis, breast cancer, epilepsy, diabetes, gout, inflammatory bowel disease, oral cancers, menopause, osteoarthritis, peptic ulcers, Parkinson’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
Keep in mind that these health conditions would be most benefited by consuming the foods rich in Vitamin E and not simply by adding a supplement to your diet plan.
You can only get sufficient amount of Vitamin E by eating variety of foods rich in it. Healthy people who consume a balanced diet seldom need supplements. You must know which foods have Vitamin E and must also follow the dietary guidelines as laid by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Human and Nutrition Information Service.
Remember, that you must always incorporate healthy fats in a proper diet plan and must focus on the Vitamin E foods in restraint that contain these healthy fats. By doing so you’d still maintain or lose weight, but it would also promote better health.

Folic AcidFolic AcidIntroductionFolate is a generic term for a water-soluble group of B vitamins including folic acid and naturally occurring folates. Folic acid is a synthetic folate compound used in vitamin supplements and fortified food because of its increased stability. The name comes from folium, which is the Latin word for leaves, because folates were first isolated from spinach in 1941. In 1962 Herbert consumed a folate-deficient diet for several months and records his development of deficiency symptoms. His findings set the criteria for the diagnosis of folate deficiency.FunctionsTetrahydrofolic acid, which is the active form of folate in the body, acts as a coenzyme in numerous essential metabolic reactions. Folate coenzymes act as acceptors and donors of one-carbon units in these reactions. Folate coenzymes play an important role in the metabolism of several amino acids, the constituents of proteins. The synthesis of the amino acid methionine from homocysteine requires a folate coenzyme and, in addition, vitamin B12. Tetrahydrofolic acid is involved in the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) � the molecules that carry genetic information in cells � and also in the formation of blood cells. Folates are therefore essential for normal cell division, proper growth and for optimal functioning of the bone marrow.
Main functions in a nutshell:Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism Coenzyme in the synthesis of nucleic acids Blood cell formation in the bone marrow
Dietary sourcesFolates are found in a wide variety of foods. Its richest sources are liver, dark green leafy vegetables, beans, wheat germ and yeast. Other sources are egg yolk, milk and dairy products, beets, orange juice and whole wheat bread.
Folates synthesised by intestinal bacteria do not contribute significantly to folate nutrition in humans because bacterial folate synthesis is usually restricted to the large intestine (colon), whereas absorption occurs mainly in the upper part of the small intestine (jejunum).Absorption and body storesMost dietary folates exist as polyglutamates, which have to be converted to the monoglutamate form in the gut before absorption. The monoglutamate form is absorbed in the proximal small intestine by an active carrier-mediated transport mechanism, and also by passive diffusion. Ingested folic acid is enzymatically reduced and methylated in the mucosa cells. The predominant form of folate in the plasma is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.
Folates are widely distributed in tissues, most of them as polyglutamate derivatives. The main storage organ is the liver, which contains about half of the body's stores.
Bioavailability
Absorption of folic acid is almost 100% when consumed under fasting conditions. When folic acid is consumed with a portion of food, bioavailability is estimated from experimental data to be 85%. The bioavailability of food folates is variable and incomplete, and has been estimated to be no more than 50% that of folic acid.
MeasurementDifferent methods are used for the measurement of folates. They can be measured by microbiological assays using Lactobacillus casei as test organism. Radioassays based on competitive protein binding are simpler to perform and are not affected by antibiotics, which give false low values in microbiological assays. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods have also been established for the analysis of folates.
Folate status is assessed by measuring serum and red blood cell folate levels of methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the predominant folate. Serum folate level is not a reliable indicator of folate deficiency, but is considered a sensitive indicator of recent folate intake. Serum concentrations < 7 nmol/L (3 ng/ml) are suggested to indicate negative folate balance. Levels in the red blood cells are considered to be an indicator of long-term status, and to be representative of tissue folate stores. Levels < 305 nmol/L (140 ng/ml) indicate inadequate folate status. A recent development has been a method for the measurement of whole blood cell folate in dried blood spots on filter paper.
Increased homocysteine levels may also indicate folate deficiency. Methyltetrahydrofolate is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Therefore plasma homocysteine concentration increases when folate is not available in sufficient amounts. Although plasma homocysteine concentration is a sensitive indicator, it is not highly specific because it may be influenced by other nutrient deficiencies (vitamin B12, B6), genetic abnormalties and renal insufficiency.StabilityMost forms of folate in food are unstable. Fresh leafy vegetables stored at room temperature may lose up to 70% of their folate activity within three days. Considerable losses also occur through leaching into cooking water (up to 95%) and through heating.InteractionsPositive interactions
Proper folate utilisation depends on an adequate supply of other vitamins of the B group such as vitamin B12 and B6 and vitamin C, which are involved in the chemical reactions needed for folate metabolism. Vitamin C may also provide the reducing conditions needed to preserve folates in the diet, and a diet deficient in folates is also likely to be deficient in vitamin C.
Negative interactions
Several chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is necessary for the metabolism of folates.
When nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) are taken in very large therapeutic doses, for example in the treatment of severe arthritis, they may interfere with folate metabolism.
Many drugs may interfere with the absorption, utilisation and storage of folates. These include alcohol, cholestyramine and colestipol (drugs used to lower blood cholesterol), antiepileptic agents such as barbiturates and diphenylhydantoin, and sulfasalazine, which is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Drugs that reduce acidity in the intestine, such as antacids and modern anti-ulcer drugs, have also been reported to interfere with the absorption of folic acid.
Early studies of oral contraceptives containing high levels of oestrogen suggested an adverse effect on folate status, but this has not been supported by more recent studies on low dose oral contraceptives.DeficiencyFolate deficiency is one of the commonest vitamin deficiencies. It can result from inadequate intake, defective absorption, abnormal metabolism or increased requirements.
Diagnosis of a subclinical deficiency relies on demonstrating reduced red cell folate concentration or on other biochemical evidence such as increased homocysteine concentration, since haematological manifestations are usually absent. Early symptoms of folate deficiency are non-specific and may include tiredness, irritability and loss of appetite.
Severe folate deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemia, a condition in which the bone marrow produces giant, immature red blood cells. At an advanced stage of anaemia symptoms of weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, irritability, headache, and palpitations appear. If left untreated, megaloblastic anaemia may be fatal. Gastrointestinal symptoms also result from severe folate deficiency.
Deficiency during pregnancy may result in premature birth, infant low birth weight and foetal growth retardation. In children, growth may be retarded and puberty delayed.
Folate deficiency is very common in many parts of the world and is part of the general problem of undernutrition. In developed countries, nutritional folate deficiency may be encountered above all in economically underprivileged groups (e.g., the elderly). Reduced folate intake is also often seen in people on special diets (e.g. weight-reducing diets).
Disorders of the stomach (e.g. atrophic gastritis) and small intestine (e.g. celiac disease, sprue, Crohn's disease) may lead to folate deficiency as a result of malabsorption. In conditions with a high rate of cell turnover (e.g. cancer, certain anaemias and skin disorders), folate requirements are increased. This is also the case during pregnancy and lactation, due to rapid tissue growth during pregnancy and to losses through the milk during lactation.
People undergoing drug treatment, e.g. for epilepsy, cancer or an infection, are at high risk of developing a folate deficiency, as are patients with renal failure who require regular haemodialysis. Acute folate deficiences have been reported to occur within a relatively short time in patients undergoing intensive care, especially those on total parenteral nutrition.Disease prevention and therapeutic use In situations where there is a high risk of folate deficiency, oral folic acid supplementation is recommended, usually in a multivitamin preparation containing 400-500 �g of folic acid.
In acute cases of megaloblastic anaemia, treatment often has to be started before a diagnosis of the cause (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency) has been made. To avoid complications that may arise by treating a B12 deficiency with folic acid in such circumstances (see below), both folic acid and vitamin B12 need to be administered until a specific diagnosis is available.
It has been demonstrated that periconceptional (before and during the first 28 days after conception) supplementation of women with folic acid can decrease the risk of neural tube defects (malformations of the brain and spinal cord, causing anencephaly or spina bifida). Therefore, a daily intake of 400 �g folic acid in addition to a healthy diet 8 weeks prior to and during the first 12 weeks after conception is recommended. There is evidence that adequate folate status may also prevent the incidence of other birth defects, including cleft lip and palate, certain heart defects and limb malformations.
Results from intervention studies have shown that a multivitamin supplement containing folic acid is more effective in decreasing the risk of neural tube defects and other birth defects than folic acid alone.
Numerous studies have shown that even moderately elevated levels of
homocysteine in the blood increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Folic acid has been shown to decrease homocysteine levels. Several randomised placebo-controlled trials are presently being conducted to establish whether folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases by lowering homocysteine blood levels.
A number of different observational studies have found poor folate status to be associated with increased cancer risk. There is evidence that folate plays a role in preventing colorectal cancer. The results of two large epidemiological investigations suggest that increased folate intake may reduce breast cancer risk associated with regular alcohol consumption.
Low folate levels have also been associated with Alzheimer�s disease, dementia and depression. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)In the USA the recommendations of the Food and Nutrition Board (1998) are expressed as DFEs. This organisation recommends a daily intake of 400 �g of DFE for adult females and males. To cover increased needs during pregnancy and lactation, it recommends 600 �g/day and 500 �g/day respectively. In Europe, the RDA varies between 200-400 �g/day for adults in different countries.
Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE) have been introduced because of the different bioavailability of folates and folic acid.
1 �g DFE = 1 �g of food folate
= 0.5 �g of folic acid taken on an empty stomach
= 0.6 �g of folic acid from fortified food or as a supplement taken with meals
SafetyOral folic acid is not toxic to humans. Even with daily doses as high as 15 mg there have been no substantiated reports of toxicity, and a daily supplement of 10 mg has been taken for five years without adverse effect.
It has been claimed that high doses of folic acid may counteract the effect of antiepileptic medication and so increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients.
A high intake of folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency. It should therefore not be used indiscriminately in patients with anaemia because of the risk of damage to the nervous system due to B12 deficiency.
The US Food and Nutrition Board (1998) set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of folic acid from fortified foods or supplements at 1,000 �g/day for adults. The EU Scientific Committee on Food (2000) also established a UL of 1,000 �g for folic acid.Supplements and food fortificationFolic acid is available as oral preparations, alone or in combination with other vitamins or minerals (e.g. iron), and as an aqueous solution for injection. As the acid is only poorly soluble in water, folate salts are used to prepare liquid dosage forms. Folinic acid (also known as leucovorin or citrovorum factor) is a derivative of folic acid administered by intramuscular injection to circumvent the action of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, such as methotrexate. It is not otherwise indicated for the prevention or treatment of folic acid deficiency.
Folic acid is added to a variety of foods, the most important of which are flour, salt, breakfast cereals and beverages, soft drinks and baby foods.
To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, cereal grains are fortified with folate in some countries. In the USA and Canada all enriched cereal grains (e.g., enriched bread, pasta, flour, breakfast cereals, and rice) are required to be fortified with folic acid. In Hungary and Chile, wheat flour is fortified with folic acid.
Industrial productionFolic acid is manufactured on a large scale by chemical synthesis. Various processes are known. Most synthesised folic acid is used in animal feed.History� History of Folic Acid

Know About Asthma Medications
January 31, 2011 by admin · Leave a CommentFiled under: Astma Relief, Health
Flunisolide is used to help prevent asthma symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath. For those who must take corticosteroids by mouth to control their asthma, flunisolide can be used to help decrease the dose of the medication that must be taken by mouth. This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as corticosteroids. It works to make breathing easier by reducing the swelling of the airways in the lungs, and decreasing phlegm and other asthma symptoms.
Corticosteroids help decrease the frequency of your attacks and reduce the need for other medications you may use to control your symptoms. Because inhaled corticosteroids control most forms of asthma by delivering medication directly to your airways, they have a low risk of side effects. When used as directed, inhaled corticosteroids can minimize your need for oral corticosteroids, which have a higher risk of side effects. Inhaled corticosteroids include fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), triamcinolone (Azmacort), flunisolide (Aerobid) and beclomethasone (Qvar). Advair Diskus is a combination inhaler containing fluticasone and salmeterol.
Asthma is a chronic, or long-term, disease. If you have asthma, at times your airways (the air passages of your lungs) become inflamed .When this happens, your airways get red and swollen. They become narrow, making it harder for you to breathe. You may also wheeze or cough. This is called an asthma flare-up (or “attack”). Even when you feel good, your airways can be inflamed. Certain things, such as smoke or dust, can start or trigger an asthma attack.
Anti-inflammatory drugs. This is the most important type of therapy for most people with asthma because these asthma medications prevent asthma attacks on an ongoing basis. Steroids, also called “corticosteroids,” are an important type of anti-inflammatory medication for people suffering from asthma. These asthma medications reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. As a result, airways are less sensitive and less likely to react to triggers.
Anti-inflammatory medications are recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) expert panel for children with mild persistent, moderate and severe asthma as the cornerstone for daily routine medical management. This panel recommends that one of these medications be given daily to control airway inflammation. They are considered safe and effective for long-term use.
Anti-inflammatory drugs are being used to counter the inflammation in the lungs and bronchial airways. These drugs are very effective in reducing the inflammations and for smooth passage of air through the airways to lungs. Usually these are given as preventive medicine in many patients to make sure that Asthmatic attacks do not occur. Steroids are one types of drugs which is highly effective in making the airways less sensitive to allergies and hence reducing the chances of inflammatory swelling of airways.
Relievers – usually in blue/grey delivery devices. They provide immediate relief from asthma symptoms by relaxing the muscles around the airways. If you need to use reliever medication more than three or four times a week (except for controlling exercise-induced asthma), you should speak to your doctor, as this may indicate your asthma is not well controlled. This is the only medication to use in an asthma attack.

What To Look Out For With An Asthma Attack?
January 21, 2011 by admin · Leave a CommentFiled under: Astma Relief, Health
Asthma kills thousand every year. Millions of people are severely plagued by this dreaded chronic illness every day of their lives.
Doctors around the world, have no idea how to prevent this disease, and its cause has remained one of medicine’s modern mysteries.
No one knows for sure how a person contracts asthma. There are logical guesses given the scientific information that medical professionals are working with, but there is no actual set doctrine of how asthma develops or whom if affects.
However, what they do know is that once you get asthma your lungs will begin to react to things that will cause an asthma attack.
For example if you are suffering from asthma, you might get an asthma attack when you get a cold or you might have an attack when you breathe in something that irritates your lungs, such as cigarette smoke, pollen or even dust.
When an asthma attack occurs, there are three things that can happen to your lungs:
1. The cells in your air tubes are producing much more mucus that normal and this particular production of mucus is sticky and thick and it will clog up the tubes making it difficult to breathe.
2. The skin in your air tubes begin to swell.
3. The muscles in your air tubes constrict and prevent you from breathing easily.
An Asthma attack can be sudden or it may take a long time to develop. An attack is measured simply by sever, moderate or mild.
A Severe Asthma Attack
When a person suffers from a sever asthma attack the first thing you need to do is call 911, get medical emergency help immediately because a person can die from a sever asthma attack.
With that said when a person is having a severe attack they become breathless, they may have trouble talking and their neck muscles may become tight.
Their lips and fingernails might have a grayish or bluish color and the skin around the ribs and/or chest may be sucked in. This type of severity mostly occurs in children.
Mild Attacks
The mild asthma attack is more common than a severe. During a mild attack a person may feel tightness in their chest, they might start to cough and/or spit up thick mucus.
At night a person might feel restless or have trouble sleeping, they might make a wheezing or whistling sound while sleeping which means they are trying to breathe in and out through narrowing air tubes.
If you feel you are suffering from a mild asthma attack you should take your medication. This will usually resolve a mild attack as the medication will open up the air passages, making it easier to breathe.
Your lungs are not who you are?
When an asthma attack comes, short of breath, tightness in the chest, can’t breathe, and very hard to focus on anything else.
But in actual reality, all your organs, brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, glands are connected. Disharmony creates the imbalances that lead to illness. My question for you: are you living in harmony with your body and environment?
There are more free articles relating to asthma at my site. Therefore, I strongly urged you to start your journey and start taking a look at my site and to get your asthma treated as soon as possible, if you are serious of getting back your asthma free life again.

Asthma Symptoms – What You Need to Know
January 19, 2011 by admin · Leave a CommentFiled under: Astma Relief, Health
Wheezing is an asthma symptom common to everyone who suffers from this respiratory problem. Inflamed airways usually cause muscles in the area to tighten, so breathing becomes difficult and wheezing is produced while breathing. Wheezing is usually the first asthma symptom that parents notice when their children are having flare-ups or asthma attacks. The hissing sound is usually more prominent during exhalation, but in some cases it can also occur during inhalation. It is quite important for people who have asthma to bring their medication, especially quick relief drugs, wherever they go because attacks can manifest slowly (taking hours or even days) or suddenly.
Another asthma symptom that should alert you of an impending attack is breathlessness. It is important for parents to regularly check on their kids who have asthma because shortness of breath is more common in asthma sufferers that have narrow airways. Another asthma symptom that is quite common is chest tightness. Some adults who are also suffering from hypertension and other cardiac-related diseases might want to be more careful with chest tightening because they might think that they are only having an asthma attack but in reality they might already be experiencing a heart attack.
Coughing is also a common asthma symptom as well as having difficulty speaking. However, these symptoms are also common in other diseases. Adults who have asthma since childhood usually know whenever they are already suffering from an asthma attack. Through years of suffering from this chronic disease, lifelong sufferers can sense whenever they are experiencing any flare-up. The case with children is quite different. Small children cannot really understand that what they are experiencing is already an asthma symptom. Thus, it is worth mentioning that parents, guardians, and caregivers of both young children and adults who have asthma should be a little more observant of the people they care for.
Another important aspect that you need to look into is the severity of an asthma symptom. You can characterize an asthma attack as mild intermittent, which means that asthma flare-ups are limited to twice a week, while nighttime attacks just twice a month. Mild persistent asthma means that symptoms are not severe but the attacks happen quite often. Moderate persistent brings about asthma flare-ups every day. And severe persistent is a type of asthma that severely attacks during the day and even at nights. Usually people with a severe persistent asthma symptom can no longer perform their everyday activities because of their condition.

How To Avoid Or Overcome An Asthma Attack
January 19, 2011 by admin · Leave a CommentFiled under: Astma Relief, Health
Copyright (c) 2009 Stephen Lau
An asthma attack can be a frightening experience when you are sweating, you cannot breathe, and your pulse is racing. These are just some of asthma symptoms.
An asthma attack is due to the swelling of the membranes lining the airways of your lungs, and thus resulting in constriction and inflammation of the bronchioles. In addition, the increased production of phlegm further aggravates the obstruction of airflow.
An asthma attack is often triggered by the following:
1. vigorous physical activities in cold, dry air condition
2. house-dust mites, mold, pollen, and tobacco smoke
3. particles of fur from animals
4. environmental pollutants
5. deficiency of vitamins, such as vitamin C and B6 vitamin, magnesium, and essential fatty acids
6. food allergies, such as dairy products, seafood, wheat, nuts, and food additives
7. psychological stress, such as anxiety
8. repressed emotions
Conventional asthma treatment includes using bronchodilators, such as an asthma inhaler of steroids, to open constricted airways. However, they are chemicals and may have long-term side effects on your health. There are alternative treatments of asthma attacks.
Asthma is all about breathing. First and foremost, to overcome an asthma attack, you must breathe right. Rapid, short breaths are not conducive to healthy breathing. To breathe right to overcome an asthma attack, practice abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing. That is to say, use your abdomen or diaphragm to breathe in and out in order to increase your lung capacity for optimal breathing.
Regular exercise not only strengthens your heart but also your lung muscles, thereby instrumental in enhancing your breathing. Oriental exercises, such as Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong, are excellent for avoiding or overcoming an asthma attack, because these ancient exercises focus on techniques of breathing and stretching with slow movements to promote better circulation and greater flexibility. In addition, these exercises remove stress, which may trigger an asthma attack.
Given that stress may trigger an asthma attack, meditation is another strategy to avoid or overcome an asthma attack. Meditation relaxes not only your mind but also your body, especially your musculoskeletal system. Remember, pain creates muscle tension, which in turn aggravates your pain, and thus creating a vicious cycle.
Hypnotherapy is another natural way of relaxing and coping with the unpleasant sensations experienced during an asthma attack. Instilling positive suggestions into your subconscious mind may help you relieve asthma symptoms and reduce the need for additional asthma medication.
Diet may play a critical role in preventing an asthma attack in terms of nutritional deficiencies and food sensitivities. Always eat natural foods, instead of their processed counterparts, to get the best nutrients as well as to avoid the overload of toxins, which may cause inflammation of airways in the lungs. Exclusion diets are the most effective way of detecting a food sensitivity.
Acupuncture is another natural therapy for asthma treatment by using needles to unblock arteries and life channels to maintain a steady flow of nutrients, oxygen, and life energy throughout your body, in particular in your respiratory system.
Asthma can be cured naturally without relying on asthma medication.

My Pains, My Chiropractor
Having low back pains has made me very familiar with Chiropractors. As a health care discipline and profession, it emphasizes diagnosis, treatment and prevention of medical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine thus I usually run to my Nashville chiropractor for my pains.
As the third largest health profession, behind medicine and dentistry, chiropractic care for low back pains became common. With their license, practitioners in the field are reliable enough given the education and training they obtained.
My Chiropractor has been taking care of me for ages now and without his help, I would not be able to function properly nor write this blog post without pain. So, if you even need chiropractic care, do your research because getting a good chiropractor may just be your saving grace too.
The Unexpected Benefits of a Good Colon Cleanse!
Why are so many people looking for the perfect colon cleanse? Given all of our unhealthy diets and unhealthy lifestyles, colon cleansing is a great way to regulate and improve the function of the colon. A regular colon cleanse is also helpful in preventing constipation. A good colon cleanser, coupled with a healthy diet rich in fibers gets rid of undigested waste as well as the hardened fecal mater that is blocking the passageway of the colon. Waste has no problem passing through the intestinal organs, preventing constipation.
There are many benefits associated with colon cleansers, but perhaps one that people do not expect is the significant weight loss that may come with it. The average colon weighs at about 4 pounds, but it has the amazing ability to store up to 30 pounds of fecal matter. Once the colon is rid of this, it is only natural for a person's weight to go down too!
Effective Sleep Aid Remedies
As more and more people experience trouble sleeping, the search for effective sleep aid remedies grows along with it too. From warm milk to prescription sleeping pills, most insomniacs are borderline desperate to try out anything! While it may be helpful to try out herbal infusions and teas, soothing baths, doctors insist on caution when taking over the counter sleeping pills. These pills may do more harm than good, pumping the body with potentially dangerous chemicals. What's more, taking these sleeping pills can lead to dependency, making it harder than ever to fall asleep without them. The best solution is still to go with something natural, which poses less threat to side effects.
Getting Menopausal Symptoms Under Control
Many women complain about the very uncomfortable symptoms associated with the onset of menopause. While it is different for every woman, a common denominator always seems to be hot flashes and night sweats. Many women live in fear of exhibiting these symptoms while in public!

A great way to get menopause relief is to use Hot Flash freedom, a natural and safe progesterone cream! It's so effective that thousands of people swear by it, including, Dr. Matazarro, a Quincy dentist and a respected member of her community. Why not try it? It just might be what you need to get rid of hot flashes and other menopausal discomforts!
The Search for the Perfect Dentist
Tooth problems can be quite bothersome, not to mention, expensive! The longer you leave it unattended, the worse it becomes! There are people who have trouble looking for the perfect dentist, which is why they let their tooth problems go on unattended. These people have obviously not heard of the amazing Glastonbury Dentist that I have come to swear by! I am confident that they're not all that's out there. I've heard good things about Richmond Dentist, Dr, Charles Martin. He is always talked about as being the best Richmond Dentist around! My cousin from Kauai also swears by her Kauai Dentist , Dr. Clyde Ishida. He comes with a great recommendation!
All these referrals just give me confidence in saying that the perfect dentist is out there for you! So, stop hesitating and start your search! It's the only way you'll say goodbye to your tooth troubles!

What can I do to aid my asthma symptoms?
May 26, 2010 by admin · 3 CommentsFiled under: Astma Relief, Blog
I had to stay over at my boyfriend’s house for a few days. I’m an asthma patient, but rarely get symptoms so I forgot my inhaler and I have no way to reach it. I’ve heard there are remedies I could do at home, can anyone tell me the most effective? Please and thank you!
Caffeine is considered to be the worst enemy of asthma. It is highly recommended to stop the intake of coffee and other caffeine products as soon as possible. Honey is an effective asthma attack home remedy. In case you suffer from an attack, breathe directly from a jar of honey. This will help you breathe more easily. Lime juice is believed to be an extremely effective asthma attack remedy. Squeeze an entire lemon in a glassful of water and consume this concoction after each and every meal. Vitamin C and zinc help prevent an asthma attack to a great extent. Foods containing high levels of vitamin C include citrus fruits, Brussels sprouts and broccoli among many others. Red meat contains high levels of zinc, but it should be consumed in small portions as they create further health problems. These are some of the effective asthma attack home remedies.

What can I do to aid my asthma symptoms?
May 26, 2010 by admin · 3 CommentsFiled under: Astma Relief, Blog
I had to stay over at my boyfriend’s house for a few days. I’m an asthma patient, but rarely get symptoms so I forgot my inhaler and I have no way to reach it. I’ve heard there are remedies I could do at home, can anyone tell me the most effective? Please and thank you!
Caffeine is considered to be the worst enemy of asthma. It is highly recommended to stop the intake of coffee and other caffeine products as soon as possible. Honey is an effective asthma attack home remedy. In case you suffer from an attack, breathe directly from a jar of honey. This will help you breathe more easily. Lime juice is believed to be an extremely effective asthma attack remedy. Squeeze an entire lemon in a glassful of water and consume this concoction after each and every meal. Vitamin C and zinc help prevent an asthma attack to a great extent. Foods containing high levels of vitamin C include citrus fruits, Brussels sprouts and broccoli among many others. Red meat contains high levels of zinc, but it should be consumed in small portions as they create further health problems. These are some of the effective asthma attack home remedies.

My Pains, My Chiropractor
Having low back pains has made me very familiar with Chiropractors. As a health care discipline and profession, it emphasizes diagnosis, treatment and prevention of medical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine thus I usually run to my Nashville chiropractor for my pains.
As the third largest health profession, behind medicine and dentistry, chiropractic care for low back pains became common. With their license, practitioners in the field are reliable enough given the education and training they obtained.
My Chiropractor has been taking care of me for ages now and without his help, I would not be able to function properly nor write this blog post without pain. So, if you even need chiropractic care, do your research because getting a good chiropractor may just be your saving grace too.
The Unexpected Benefits of a Good Colon Cleanse!
Why are so many people looking for the perfect colon cleanse? Given all of our unhealthy diets and unhealthy lifestyles, colon cleansing is a great way to regulate and improve the function of the colon. A regular colon cleanse is also helpful in preventing constipation. A good colon cleanser, coupled with a healthy diet rich in fibers gets rid of undigested waste as well as the hardened fecal mater that is blocking the passageway of the colon. Waste has no problem passing through the intestinal organs, preventing constipation.
There are many benefits associated with colon cleansers, but perhaps one that people do not expect is the significant weight loss that may come with it. The average colon weighs at about 4 pounds, but it has the amazing ability to store up to 30 pounds of fecal matter. Once the colon is rid of this, it is only natural for a person's weight to go down too!
Effective Sleep Aid Remedies
As more and more people experience trouble sleeping, the search for effective sleep aid remedies grows along with it too. From warm milk to prescription sleeping pills, most insomniacs are borderline desperate to try out anything! While it may be helpful to try out herbal infusions and teas, soothing baths, doctors insist on caution when taking over the counter sleeping pills. These pills may do more harm than good, pumping the body with potentially dangerous chemicals. What's more, taking these sleeping pills can lead to dependency, making it harder than ever to fall asleep without them. The best solution is still to go with something natural, which poses less threat to side effects.
Getting Menopausal Symptoms Under Control
Many women complain about the very uncomfortable symptoms associated with the onset of menopause. While it is different for every woman, a common denominator always seems to be hot flashes and night sweats. Many women live in fear of exhibiting these symptoms while in public! Who wants to experience a hot flash in front of everyone to see?!
A great way to get menopause relief is to use Hot Flash freedom, a natural and safe progesterone cream! It's so effective that thousands of people swear by it, including, Dr. Matazarro, a Quincy dentist and a respected member of her community. Why not try it? It just might be what you need to get rid of hot flashes and other menopausal discomforts!
The Search for the Perfect Dentist
Tooth problems can be quite bothersome, not to mention, expensive! The longer you leave it unattended, the worse it becomes! There are people who have trouble looking for the perfect dentist, which is why they let their tooth problems go on unattended. These people have obviously not heard of the amazing Glastonbury Dentist that I have come to swear by! I am confident that they're not all that's out there. I've heard good things about Richmond Dentist, Dr, Charles Martin. He is always talked about as being the best Richmond Dentist around! My cousin from Kauai also swears by her Kauai Dentist , Dr. Clyde Ishida. He comes with a great recommendation!
All these referrals just give me confidence in saying that the perfect dentist is out there for you! So, stop hesitating and start your search! It's the only way you'll say goodbye to your tooth troubles!
Solutions for Retirees
You could even make it easier for you by looking into an Assisted Living Decatur arrangement. You'll not only be in a comfortable home, but it will be amongst a beautiful community, equipped with the latest innovations in landscaping such as California synthetic turf golf courses. You could really make retiring an excellent opportunity to create a new and exciting life!
Looking for Business Finance Options?
Everywhere you look there are exciting and new ideas popping up. Things like Flower Essences are new and exciting concepts, and are carving out their respective niche markets. Perhaps you have an idea that can be marketed too? Why not take the plunge and look into your Business Finance Options! You may just find a invoice financing proposition that is to your liking, and one that can give you the funding you need to make your dream business idea into a reality!

My Pains, My Chiropractor
Having low back pains has made me very familiar with Chiropractors. As a health care discipline and profession, it emphasizes diagnosis, treatment and prevention of medical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine thus I usually run to my Nashville chiropractor for my pains.
As the third largest health profession, behind medicine and dentistry, chiropractic care for low back pains became common. With their license, practitioners in the field are reliable enough given the education and training they obtained.
My Chiropractor has been taking care of me for ages now and without his help, I would not be able to function properly nor write this blog post without pain. So, if you even need chiropractic care, do your research because getting a good chiropractor may just be your saving grace too.
The Unexpected Benefits of a Good Colon Cleanse!
Why are so many people looking for the perfect colon cleanse? Given all of our unhealthy diets and unhealthy lifestyles, colon cleansing is a great way to regulate and improve the function of the colon. A regular colon cleanse is also helpful in preventing constipation. A good colon cleanser, coupled with a healthy diet rich in fibers gets rid of undigested waste as well as the hardened fecal mater that is blocking the passageway of the colon. Waste has no problem passing through the intestinal organs, preventing constipation.
There are many benefits associated with colon cleansers, but perhaps one that people do not expect is the significant weight loss that may come with it. The average colon weighs at about 4 pounds, but it has the amazing ability to store up to 30 pounds of fecal matter. Once the colon is rid of this, it is only natural for a person's weight to go down too!
Effective Sleep Aid Remedies
As more and more people experience trouble sleeping, the search for effective sleep aid remedies grows along with it too. From warm milk to prescription sleeping pills, most insomniacs are borderline desperate to try out anything! While it may be helpful to try out herbal infusions and teas, soothing baths, doctors insist on caution when taking over the counter sleeping pills. These pills may do more harm than good, pumping the body with potentially dangerous chemicals. What's more, taking these sleeping pills can lead to dependency, making it harder than ever to fall asleep without them. The best solution is still to go with something natural, which poses less threat to side effects.

View Full Version : Plane
Jimbo07-08-2004, 14:30So...say you're on a plane. Its been on the runway for 40 minutes. The APU is down so there is no AC. Temperature climbs into the high uncomfortables. Flight attendant comes over the PA and asks if there are any medically trained people on board. You are the only person to identify yourself. She tells you that there is a young woman who is clausterphobic and another young woman who has asthma. The asthmatic is not having any problems...yet, but does not have an inhaler and does not know what kind of asthma she has. The clausterphobe is not presenting either, but the flight attendant wants to know what to do to make the two more comfortable and what to do if either has an attack.
What do you tell her?
shadowflyer07-08-2004, 15:06Hmm good one Jimbo.
Lets see.
PT 1 Claustrophobe--TX Keep her calm, if possible open one of the side doors if the engines are not running, if the engines are running then we would have A/C regardless of wheter or not the APU was operable. Engines will have enough bleed air to run the A/C system. PT will need to feel like they are ""open"" persey vs closed in. Main thing is keep her calm. If 02 is available , 15L 02 NRB mask if tolerable would help ease her worries a bit. NC 02 if she cant tolerate the mask.
PT 2 Asthmatic--TX Keep her calm. POC. Inhaler would help if she goes into Asthma attack. Bronchodilator will be a BIG help. If 02 is available, 15lpm O2 NRB if she goes into distress at all.
Just my thoughts. Any Airway bag/kit on board? Trauma Kit on board. I hope they have a AED.
Jimbo07-08-2004, 15:30There was O2 on board, but no airway kit nor trauma kit. I was not aware if there was an AED on board or not.
The flight attendant was unwilling or unable to open the hatch. The engines were running but there was still no A/C. I think its like idle vs. full gas and the A/C in your car.
Luckily, the situation did not go south. The plane got airborne within 15 minutes.
I did not reccommend giving O2 to the clausterphobe because if the Asthmatic went bad, I wanted to have as much on hand as possible. I asked the flight attendant to have the clausterphobe sit in the jump seat because there was a fan in the galley that would blow on her and she wold be able to see that she was in a larger space than she may have though while in her seat.
The Reaper07-08-2004, 16:00Most a/c have Valium on board in the med kit, IIRC.

As a lowly EMT, I would not have been allowed to administer that to her. An EMT can't administer meds, but they can assist a patient self-sdminister some meds.
Ambush Master07-08-2004, 16:05This had better be a Part 91 Operation and not 135 or 121, because since the mid-80's there has to be an emer med kit on board and there are 2 airways in them !! Also, diphenhydramine HCL , epi, dextrose and various means to inject !!
Sacamuelas07-08-2004, 16:09The claustrophobic patient:
check the patient first...
I would not give o2 via NRB prophylactically just because they have a Hx of claustrophobia. Many anxiety disorder patients exhibit hyperventilation as a symptom leading up to and during an episode. Giving 02 to an already hyperventilating pt via a nonrebreather would be counter-productive. So check your patient for this before this Tx.
When hyperventilating, Patients tend to breathe by using the upper thorax rather than the diaphragm, which results in chronic over inflated lungs. When the stress induces a need to take a deep breath, the deep breathing is perceived as dyspnea. The sensation of dyspnea creates anxiety, which encourages more deep breathing, and a vicious cycle is created.
To treat, instruct the patient to breathe abdominally, using the diaphragm more than the chest wall. This often leads to improvement in 'subjective' or patient perceived dyspnea and eventually corrects many of the associated symptoms.
Otherwise, I would calm the patient, put in a comfortable position, tell the FA to see about activating her protocol for giving the passenger a sedative ( short acting benzo if available). I would imagine major airlines have a med kit on teh plane with sedatives as well as a protocol for their use. I would not put my Butt on the line prescribing or telling a FA to give a medication, especially in a non emergency case such as this. No caffeine or other stimulants for the patient during the flight.
The asthma patient:
My guess is that the plane's med kit has an inhaler ( probably albuterol). Tell the FA to go and visually check for its existence. If available, give patient prophylactic dose to inhale after quick med hx. Again, place pt in low stress environment ( as low as possible)... oxygen is good to calm patient if feeling symptoms of dyspnea. Usually want to place patient in a comfortable environment avoiding HOT/MOIST air and Cold/dry air environments. Also have patient avoid caffeine, as it is a common trigger for asthma attacks.
If an asthma attack actually would have occurred-
02 immediately. If no inhaler available, ask patient to notify of any oncoming attack asap ( if they can tell, they usually can) and in an emergency the planes epi pen can be used to bronchodilate to stop the attack. During a severe attack, I would have asked the FA to announce over the PA to see if a passenger on board had an inhaler with them.
That�s my .02....

I was not made aware of any kits on the plane. However, I never asked. The one patient that was feeling at all off was responding well to the seat change and fan. When I was approached by the flight attendant, I was told about the two patients. I asked if the Asthmatic had her inhaler. The flight attendant told me ""No. But I have oxygen."" That was the extent of it. Had things gotten worse, I would have requested that we taxi back to the terminal. Had things gotten bad fast, I hope the stewardess would ahve mentioned having a med kit on board. Thanks for the reminder and the heads up that the plane should have that equip, I will make a note to remember to ask what's on hand.
This was one of the new budget airlines. I have no idea if they were up to regs or not.

Coffee and Health Issues
Regrettably, one of the many Coffee and Health issues are the health risks to people in some countries and how it affects their ability to drink it safely. Doctors and health care officials have been taught that it is an unhealthy beverage to drink. These teachings have been based on 40+ year old research methods which have been shown by current research to be incorrect. But, since the doctors are not current on these new facts, they convey the inaccurate picture of coffee as being unhealthy. In fact, current studies have proven that drinking in moderation can be good for your health.Health & Coffee ProductsAcai Berry ProductsAlzheimers ProductsAsthma ReliefColon Cleanse CapsulesColon Cleanse KitsColon Cleanse TeasColon Detox ProductsColon Cleanse Weight LossAnti-Depression ProductsEnema KitsParkinson's Disease BooksParkinson's ProductsSt. John's Wort CapsulesSt. John's Wort TeaHealth & Coffee ArticlesAlzheimersAntioxidantsAsthmaCaffeineDepressionDiabetesCoffee ColonicsCoffee EnemaCoffee Enema RecipeBenefit of Coffee EnemasDanger of Coffee EnemasOrganic Coffee EnemaDIY Coffee EnemaColon CleanseExercise PerformanceGallstonesGano Healthy CoffeeHealthy CoffeeHeartburnHepatitis-CMental AlertnessParkinsons DiseasePhysical FitnessWith the help of addiction recovery programs. drug abusers who have just finished treatment are given a chance to transition to a new life without drugs.In reality it is more than caffeine and yellow teeth. With the chemical make up of coffee, coffee and health studies have shown new and very and beneficial properties for concerning health issues. One of the discoveries in coffee and health studies is the effect in the chemical make up of the dissolvement of Chlorogenic Acid, a property in the chemical make up of coffee. It has been found that Chlorogenic Acid is a strong antioxidant which helps in the reduction of oxidative tissue stress and some anti-inflammatory issues. Coffee and Health Studies have also found that coffee drinking can help prevent possible drug addictions and may act as an anti-depressant. An interesting issue is how consumption affects brain functions. It may coincide with anti-drug addiction properties. It has chem-protective properties that can provide defense against Hepatitis C, Gallstones, Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Coffee and Health studies have also shown coffee consumption to halt the development of Type 2 Diabetes in the later years of adulthood with a modest amount of consumption on a daily basis. When a person is having an asthma attack and they do not have an inhaler available, the next best thing would be drinking a cup of coffee. Side Effects from the Caffeine Content:Helps Develop Creative ThoughtsBetter Decision MakingShort and Long Term Memory ImprovementIncrease Endurance during Physical ActivitiesHalt the risk of Type 2 Diabetes in later years of Adulthood In coffee and health research of around 126,000 men and women, it was discovered that if people consumed more pure coffee it would reduce the chances of people developing Blood Sugar Disease compared to people who didn't consume any or don't drink but small amounts of this beverage.In a coffee and health study of men and consumption, men who drank up to 5 cups a day lowered their chances contracting type 2 diabetes. The health benefits for women were somewhat less, but still beneficial. Previous studies showed the average American coffee drinker drank about three cups a day. Research done by Harvard University combined all previous studies to come up with a new average, namely 1 to 2 cups a day.Even though these coffee and health studies show that there is Even though these coffee and health studies show that there is a reduction in the risk of type 2 Diabetes with consumption, researcher's don't recommend increasing your consumption to try to decrease or prevent the chances of developing diabetes. More recent research has shown that consumption leads to healthier blood sugar levels. A study of Swedish women showed that drinking at least 2 cups daily were less at risk for diabetes than women who drank none or less than 2 cups daily. However, researchers have been unable to determine which chemical compound of the hundreds found in coffee actually helped to reduce the risk of diabetes. Consumption reduced the risk for diabetes despite other factors involved such as smoking, drinking alcoholic beverages and being involved in other unhealthy lifestyles. More to that first cupResearch has found that your first cup in the day could shield you against colon cancer.In a study by German researchers on an enzyme called Methylpyridinium it was discovered to prevent or protect against colon cancer. Using animals to test this highly potent antioxidant researchers found that it excites production of Phase ll Enzyme's which are believed to protect against colon cancer palpitation's. This is according to a recent magazine article about the relationship between coffee and health. Methylpyridinium is an anti-cancer compound that is in coffee which has for years been thought to protect against Colon Cancer and now has been identified as doing just that. A professor at the University of Munster has said that until human studies are done we won't know the total effects of it on colon cancer development. He also noted that in comparison to medium roast coffee, espresso has 2 to 3 times the amount of cancer fighting agents. Even instant has the same anti-cancer compounds found in caffeinated and decaffeinated. Coffee enemas detoxify the liver, as well as cleanse the colon. Some people claim that they provide immediate relief to toxicity symptoms, such as congestion, indigestion, pain and headaches. There are even some small studies on coffee and health that suggest that in enema form it can aid in the treatment of Pancreatic Cancer. At the very end of the colon, before reaching the rectum, is an ""S"" shaped segment called the sigmoid colon. There is a special circulatory system between this portion of the colon and the liver.

Coffee and Asthma – What is the Connection?
Posted on Dec 01, 2010 | Comments 0
Scientists have wondered how coffee might offer some benefit to asthma sufferers and now it would seem that there is something in the chemical structure of coffee that could help asthma sufferers.
The chemical structure of coffee resembles theophylline, which is common medication for asthma sufferers. This medication helps to ease the airways and symptoms of an asthma attack such as shortness of breath, wheezing and constricted airways occur.
It has been found that when coffee is digested and broken down by the digestive process in the body, small amounts of theophyline are in fact produced.
When the results of 6 clinical trials were examined by researchers of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, it was found that caffeine produced small improvements in the functioning of airways among asthmatics. And this positive impact was seen to last for up to 4 hours. Even a small amount of caffeine could improve lung function for up to two hours.
If however one thinks that one makes coffee a replacement for medication they would be wrong. While momentary relief may be obtained from caffeine, this is not substantial enough. Further, too much coffee intake can have negative side effects so it is best to continue to limit intake of items with caffeine such as tea, coffee, chocolate and so on.

There are many asthma remedies that you can probably count on during times of emergency. But aside from relieving your attacks asthma remedies can also be considered a crucial partner along with your conventional medication, strengthening your body�s natural immunity making you more resilient to flare-ups and episodes. The only difficult part with be in the determination of remedies which would work well for your particular condition because there are so many too choose from and not everything is effective, others might actually be dangerous.
Try looking up asthma remedies in the internet and you will be returned with millions upon millions of sites offering home remedies, alternative medications, herbal concoctions, and more. Of course it would be impossible to look up each and every result one by one, to make things easier here are a few things that you would probably want to keep in mind. First look for home remedies or remedies that do not make up more than three combinations of ingredients. The more ingredients present the higher the chances of you getting a different reaction from it (and not a good reaction at that).
Secondly, you�d want to be open-minded and rational when looking for possible remedy candidates. Look into the rationality of why a certain herb or combination can be effective and do not depend on the �guarantees� and claims that are being offered. Thirdly and most importantly, take your safety into the highest account before jumping into treatment. Ask your doctor if what you have chosen is indeed effective or not and why. There are a lot of good herbal remedies that are available out there and just to give you an idea, here are a few things that you might want to look further into:
Coffee: The caffeine present in coffee belongs to the Xanthine chemical group containing Theophylline and Theobromine. Theophylline in particular is a powerful bronchodilator that has been used for many years in treating asthma. Drinking about two cups of hot, strong coffee (preferably brewed) can help ease your symptoms or bring your attack under control by constricting the blood vessels, relieving inflammation and breaking down mucus allowing air to flow in and out of the lungs easier. Daily intake of coffee has also been found to minimize the chances of attacks and flare-ups from occurring in asthmatics.
Honey: Honey has also been used by more asthmatics as an emergency reliever as compared to other home remedies. Putting a jug of honey (preferably non- tampered, all natural, non-imported) under the nose when symptoms show can prevent further worsening by acting as anti inflammatory and expectorant. Drinking milk mixed with two teaspoonfuls of honey every night can also prevent attacks and flare-ups from happening.
So as you can see, it does not really require complicated combinations of herbs or other ingredients in order to make a quick asthma remedy effective. All you need is rational thinking, common sense and proper research to find out which might work for you best.

Effective And Simple Asthma Home Remedies
Effective And Simple asthma Home Remedies
Article by John Handson
Asthma is a respiratory disease that makes breathing difficult, particularly while exhaling. Pollens, allergens, irritants and bacteria can prompt an asthmatic attack. These include diet that causes allergy and environmental factors such as dust, dampness, smoke etc. asthma home remedies can prove to be very useful and help to prevent an asthma attack.
Here are few effective and simple asthma home remedies that can provide the much needed relief from the symptoms of asthma attacks:
Lemon and Water:
Lemon and water are known to restrain purifying properties. Water flushes out the toxic substances and purifies the blood, whereas lemon or lime has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and expectorant agents that can easily break-down mucus.
Figs:
Fig, a fruit that helps to heal many illnesses, is also beneficial in asthma. Figs make the patient feel comfortable by depleting the phlegm. Clean 2-3 figs thoroughly with lukewarm water and soak in water overnight and have it first thing in the morning.
Bananas:
Bananas provide fast remedy for serious attacks. Heat a ripe banana in the microwave or on the stove, sprinkle black pepper powder on it and eat. This will open the air ways temporarily and allow free-flow of air which will help to subside the pain from an asthma attack. Though it is only a short term treatment; bananas offer one of the best asthma home remedies for instant relief.
Garlic:
Garlic contains natural anti-inflammatory agents that aid in treating asthma. It also reduces the quantity of mucous generated in the bronchial tubes. 1-2 garlic cloves can be chewed daily or garlic juice can be added to other vegetable juices and consumed.
Honey:
Honey effectively boosts the immune systems of the body which aids to treat and avoid asthma attacks. During an asthma attack, one can breathe in the vapors of honey by placing the jar under the nose. Alternatively, consuming a teaspoon of honey 3-4 times a day can alleviate the problem of asthma. It can also be added to a beverage.
Coffee:
The caffeine content in coffee works like the over the counter medicines, which aids to open the air passages of an asthma patient. Consuming 1-2 cups of coffee can reduce the asthma symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing.
Mustard Oil and Camphor:
Rub the mixture of mustard oil and camphor on the chest if before going to sleep or if you experience breathing problems. Mustard oil infiltrates the skin and breaks down the phlegm which helps to ease asthma attacks. This mixture should not be taken internally. This is one of the most soothing asthma home remedies.
Other Home Remedies:
Additional effectual asthma home remedies comprise of bishop’s weed which acts like an expectorant. Indian gooseberry that fortifies the immunity power, bitter gourd root that sustains antiviral properties and drumstick leaves which contain antibacterial properties. All of these are highly rich in vitamin C and can be used to treat asthma attacks.
Other Preventive Methods:
Avoid excessive eating before going to sleep as it may prompt an asthma attack. Try as eat at least 2-3 hours before bedtime. Steer clear of cigarette smoke or second hand smoke as well as smoke from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces. Wrap a scarf or wear a face mask if the weather is cold. Refrain from breathing in the cold air that is discharged from the freezer. Avoid keeping animals with fur as pet.
Keep The Home Clean:
Change the air conditioner and furnace filters each month to prevent recirculation of dust. Opt for latex pillows that are allergy-free rather than feather pillows. Additionally, use dust-resistant covers on mattresses and furniture. Keep your home neat and clean to minimize the chances of an asthma attack.
These were some of the effectual asthma home remedies that can be employed to obtain relief from asthma. Apart from these remedies, make a note of the factors like allergens, foods etc that triggers your asthma symptoms and aggravates the illness and try to evade them. asthma attacks are extremely uncomforting, but with few simple asthma home remedies and safety measures; you can easily keep asthma attacks at bay.

Coffee-drinking associated with a reduced risk of death in women
Home → Healthy Eating → Coffee-drinking associated with a reduced risk of death in women
Jun, Wed 18th, 2008

Generally, people tend to have quite firmly established ideas about weather a food is healthy or not. And they may even have some idea about which conditions a food is supposed to protect against or promote. So, for instance, when asked to comment on red meat, most people will express the view that this food is inherently unhealthy, and will often qualify this by mentioning its supposed link with heart disease and colon cancer. And when many people think of sugary soft drinks, their mind will tend to go rapidly to problems such as tooth decay and weight gain.
Another foodstuff that tends to labour under an unhealthy image is coffee. Yet, when I ask individuals what it is about this drink that is so unhealthy I find the answers can be very vague indeed. Some may mention caffeine but be unable to say what the problem might be here. Mostly, though, individuals are unable to say what it is about coffee that makes it a supposedly undesirable beverage.
One reason for this is that there isn’t actually much evidence that coffee is unhealthy. In fact, there is a fair body of evidence suggesting quite the reverse. Not so long ago one of my blog posts looked at some of the evidence linking coffee consumption with a reduced risk of certain conditions including diabetes and cardiovascular disease (such as heart attacks and stroke).
Some have suggested that the apparent health-giving properties of coffee may come, at least in part, from the ‘antioxidant’ substances it contains (including so-called ‘polyphenols’ that are found in other foodstuffs such as tea, cocoa, onions and apples).
With this background in mind, I was interested to read about a study published this week which looked at the relationship between coffee-drinking and risk of death in a group of about 86,000 women and 42,000 men. Men in this group were monitored for 18 years, while women were monitored for 24 years.
The researchers who conducted this study, from the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston, USA, looked at the relationship between different levels of coffee consumption and overall risk of death in both men and women. In women, compared to drinking less than one cup of coffee per month, drinking at least 5-7 cups of coffee per week was associated with a statistically significant reduction in overall risk of death. In particular:
Drinking 5-7 cups of coffee per week was associated with a 7 per cent reduction in risk of death
Drinking 2-3 cups of coffee per day was associated with an 18 per cent reduction in risk of death
Drinking 4-5 cups of coffee per day was associated with a 26 per cent reduction in risk of death
Drinking 6 or more cups of coffee per day was associated with a 17 per cent reduction in risk of death
For men, no statistically significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend for increasingly lower risk of death as coffee consumption increased. Specifically:
Drinking 2-3 cups of coffee per day was associated with a 3 per cent reduction in risk of death
Drinking 4-5 cups of coffee per day was associated with a 7 per cent reduction in risk of death
Drinking 6 or more cups of coffee per day was associated with a 20 per cent reduction in risk of death
This study showed that the reduction in risk of death was, essentially, due to a reduced risk of deaths due to cardiovascular disease. So-called epidemiological studies of this nature cannot be used to prove that coffee can reduce the risk of death. However, in women at least, this study supports the notion that coffee may have real benefits for health and longevity.
One weakness of this sort of epidemiological study is that it’s not coffee drinking per se, but factors associated with coffee drinking (so-called confounding factors) that may be the real reason behind an association with this dietary habit and disease. For instance, coffee-drinking may be more prevalent among younger people, and it might be their relatively young age that is the reason for why coffee-drinkers appear to be at a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. In this study, certain confounding factors (including age, smoking and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease) were accounted for, which strengthens its findings somewhat.
All-in-all, this study seems to provide further evidence that coffee does not deserve its quite unhealthy reputation. It also supports the idea that coffee might even have some significant benefits for health.

“However, in women at least, this study supports the notion that coffee may have real benefits for health and longevity.”
Whoopee!
My fiancé is called Tinkerbell. Tinkerbell drinks a lot of coffee while Tiger drinks copious cups of tea. I am very pleased to learn that my strong belief in fairies … is soundly evidence based.
Jonathan Swift 18 June 2008
“One reason for this is that there is actually much evidence that coffee is unhealthy”
Should that read “isn’t” or have I read it wrong?
Dawn 19 June 2008
Did the study look at how the coffee was prepared? Was it instant or freshly brewed. Caffeinated or decaffeinated? Was milk included…seems there are a lot more questions than answers!
Dr John Briffa 19 June 2008
Jonathan
Thanks for that – corrected now.
chainey 19 June 2008
One of the “unhealthy” elements of coffee is supposed (I don’t have proof) to be its effect on people who are prone to anxiety. Caffeine is allegedly able to induce panic attacks in sufficient quantity.
Six cups of coffee a day sounds like a lot if we’re talking full strength “real” coffee. I’d be climbing the walls on more than 3-4.
ross 19 June 2008
Did the study account for other confounding factors such as socio-economic background, lifestyle etc?
Sherrie 20 June 2008
Caffeine can also spike insulin in some people.
I never seemed to have problems with caffeine myself though it may hit me now if I suddenly drank lots as I have been drinking decaff ever since I fell pregnant 4 years ago. Which reminds me I do recall a negative study regarding caffeine consumption during pregnancy but I don’t recall the details.
Anyhow, regarding the comment on anxiety levels my partner has this problem. He used to drink lots of caffeine years ago and was always moody and anxious, then during a health kick dropped caffeine entirely and became much more pleasant, neither of us picked up on it. Then eventually caffeine had come back into his diet again but no where near the amounts that he used to drink and I was given my first coffee machine for Xmas. Anyway so off I went and made us a nice espresso and he went off the rails, I remember later we were in a shop being served and he practically bit my head off the lady was in shock, it was so unlike him. Thats when it dawned on us that he had a problem with caffeine.
Ever since, time and time again when he lets caffeine slip back into his diet he gets really moody and anxious without fail.

It would be helpful to have some other perspective on coffee, for example, re caffeine, and the reputation this has for leaching calcium from the bones. Older people are presumably statistically more in danger from heart attacks, but they are also more at risk of osteoporosis than younger people.
Liz 20 June 2008
Sherrie’s comments show that coffee doesn’t suit everyone.
And if it doesn’t, don’t use it.
But it’s nice to know that for some of us the coffee might actually be doing us good!
Richard 20 June 2008
Coffee drinking is associated with insulin resistance according to this:

Susan 20 June 2008
Isnt coffee supposed to be avoided by people with borderline or high blood pressure?
Sue 22 June 2008
Some other possible benefits of coffee:
Caffeine’s bronchodilator effect of opening the air-ways can be beneficial to people suffering from acute bronchial asthma. Caffeine acts as an analgesic (pain killer) and, when combined with ibuprofen, can bring faster and longer lasting relief from tension headaches. It is often prescribed for migraine headaches. Drinking two cups of coffee before breakfast has helped individuals suffering from dizziness and other effects caused by abnormally low blood pressure.
http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/2142/Caffeine-HEALTH-EFFECTS.html
Coffee �” New Health Food
Consider this: At least six studies indicate that people who drink coffee on a regular basis are up to 80% less likely to develop Parkinson’s, with three showing the more they drink, the lower the risk. Other research shows that compared to not drinking coffee, at least two cups daily can translate to a 25% reduced risk of colon cancer, an 80% drop in liver cirrhosis risk, and nearly half the risk of gallstones.
Coffee even offsets some of the damage caused by other vices, some research indicates. “People who smoke and are heavy drinkers have less heart disease and liver damage when they regularly consume large amounts of coffee compared to those who don’t,” says DePaulis.
There’s also some evidence that coffee may help manage asthma and even control attacks when medication is unavailable, stop a headache, boost mood, and even prevent cavities.
But you can get other benefits from coffee that have nothing to do with caffeine. “Coffee is loaded with antioxidants, including a group of compounds called quinines that when administered to lab rats, increases their insulin sensitivity” he tells WebMD. This increased sensitivity improves the body’s response to insulin.
That may explain why in that new Harvard study, those drinking decaf coffee but not tea beverages also showed a reduced diabetes risk, though it was half as much as those drinking caffeinated coffee.
“We don’t know exactly why coffee is beneficial for diabetes,” lead researcher Frank Hu, MD, tells WebMD. “It is possible that both caffeine and other compounds play important roles. Coffee has large amounts of antioxidants such as chlorogenic acid and tocopherols, and minerals such as magnesium. All these components have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.”
Meanwhile, Italian researchers credit another compound called trigonelline, which gives coffee its aroma and bitter taste, for having both antibacterial and anti-adhesive properties to help prevent dental cavities from forming. There are other theories for other conditions.

Asthma Attack Preventers and Relievers
by Patrick
Asthma is a chronic illness that is said to be increasing on a worldwide scale in both adults and children. If you or your child suffers from asthma you should know that there are two main types of asthma treatment: asthma preventers and asthma attack relievers. Both of these are available in a variety of devices known as inhalers. Although neither are asthma cures, they both help to control the disease and enable the sufferer to breathe more easily.
Asthma Attack Preventers
Asthma preventers are designed to reduce the chances of an asthma attack occurring. They work by reducing the swelling and inflammations experienced in the airways and are advised to be taken on a daily basis even if the sufferer is not experiencing any symptoms. The main ingredient in asthma prevents for adults are corticosteroids and due to the possible side effects only the lowest dose needed will be administered. Children will not be prescribed preventers of this kind, they instead will have non steroid based medicine.
Asthma Attack Relievers
Asthma relievers are for sufferers to take during an asthma attack or during a prolonged period of troubled breathing. They work by opening up the airways making it easier for the sufferer to breathe. As they do not reduce inflammation of the airways, asthma sufferers are often advised to take their asthma preventers at the same time as the relievers. Most asthma attack relievers will alleviate the symptoms of asthma almost instantly although some will be prescribed that have a longer lasting effect.
Other Asthma Treatment Medication
Most forms of asthma treatment medication comes in the form of an aerosol based inhaler however there are different forms of preventers of asthma attack medication. These include:
• Steroid tablets – these are generally only prescribed to those whose asthma is really bad. They will usually be prescribed in short doses and work to instantly calm down an inflamed airway.
• Anti-inflammatory tablets – these are a relatively new asthma attack treatment but they have proven to be very effective for people who suffer from aspirin related asthma and brittle asthma.
• Omalizumab – This comes in the form of an injection and is generally only used on those who have a persistent and severe form of allergic asthma.
Asthma Attack Treatment for Children
Due to the side effects that can be experienced when taking the steroid based treatments, children are more likely to be prescribed asthma treatment inhalers that contain nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate. Although not as effective as the asthma treatment for adults they are much safer. The main ingredients in asthma attack relievers are terbutaline and salbutamol. Whilst these are generally safe for children, toddlers and babies under the age of two will be prescribed a different type of asthma treatment – ipratromium bromide.
Natural Remedies for Asthma
To avoid the harmful side effects that come with many forms of asthma treatment medication many people are now looking for natural treatments. This is particularly true in the case of children with some natural remedies for asthma even leading to a lower reliance on medication. Some home remedies to try include:
• Red hot chilli peppers – Foods that are naturally hot, naturally open up the airways and work as an anti-inflammatory.
• Salmon – Salmon and any fish rich in Omega 3 somehow seem to help the lungs react better to irritants. Some people have also claimed that eating foods rich in Omega 3 can prevent a person from getting asthma in the first place. Researchers have also shown that asthma sufferers who eat salmon on a regular basis are 50% less likely to have an asthma attack than those who don’t.
• Yoghurt – Vitamin B12 which is found in yoghurt is proven to alleviate asthma symptoms and can even prevent an asthma attack.
• Orange Juice – and other foods rich in Vitamin C can decrease the wheezing suffered by asthma sufferers by up to 30%.
• Onions – Cooked onions are said to combat the irritants which can cause asthma attacks.
• Coffee – the caffeine found in regular coffee is said to control and prevent asthma attacks due to its bronchodilating effects. Three cups of coffee a day is enough to alleviate asthma symptoms but it should not be given to children.
Aside from the above, eliminating other asthma attack causes, like the pets of your house, mold and any other irritant can also help to prevent an asthma attack. Before trying any of the treatments mentioned in this article you are recommended to speak to your doctor first.

01/02/2009 - ArticlesWhy orthotics do not help your backBy: Susan Aldridge, medical journalist, PhDTools:Summary
Charles Gaudet is a health and wellness expert who has drawn on his own experience of back pain to find a way to help the body to heal itself. Many turn to orthotic insoles to correct the problem, he says. But expert opinion now suggests that this provides just temporary relief and may even make the pain worse in the long term.
Introduction
So you purchased those sole insoles for back pain relief and things are beginning to feel better? The truth is, those comfy, squishy foot pads are not a realistic long-term back pain relief solution. In fact, they will probably make your back pain worse in the long term. There is more to back pain relief, and it's not difficult to get the complete solution.
Although insoles may provide some back pain relief, experts warn that insoles and orthotic inserts only briefly alleviate back pain symptoms. They are not a back pain relief treatment in and of themselves. While arch supports, insoles and orthotics may provide support where foot problems do affect back pain, they do not address the core problem. In fact they may tend to make things worse.
Expert opinion
'The human body is a complex muscular system that is all interconnected, and one problem can create others' said Charles Gaudet, a health and wellness expert. His website, www.BackandneckPainResources.com outlines what he has learned on his long road to recovery from debilitating back and neck pain. 'If a foot problem is manifesting as back pain, it is because the injury or weakness in the feet is causing strain on other muscles and connective tissues in the body. The result in this case is back pain' the issue is that the body is out of balance.
Gaudet is among a number of back pain relief experts who want sufferers to know the complete story on what will really full back pain relief. Insoles only mask a sign of a problem. Without the proper exercise, stretching and strengthening of the muscular systems involved, the core back pain problem never gets addressed.
Doctors say insoles and inserts may provide some limited back pain relief, but they don't have any direct, positive effect on the source of the back pain. Dr Nick Shamie, assistant clinical professor of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery with the UCLA Comprehensive Spine Center recently told the Los Angeles Times that feet and back are two different issues and there is no evidence to support the claims made by insole manufacturers. 'These things don't do anything biomechanically for the body' said Dr Andrew Shapiro, a podiatrist and spokesman for the American Podiatric Medical Association. 'High arches and flat feet can sometimes set off a reaction that puts stress on knees and back.'
The solution to back pain
For the most common sources of back pain, the solution lies in basic exercises, correction of posture and simple nutrition, says Gaudet, a lifelong athlete who has faced extreme, crippling chronic pain in his back and neck. He stresses that exercise and stretching are key, natural ways to seriously and completely take on back pain relief.
'You have to address strengthening and correction of the muscles that support the body or the pain just doesn't go away,' he says. 'Though insoles may provide short term back pain relief, in the long haul, using artificial support sends a message to the body that the imbalance issues are taken care of and, therefore, discourages natural healing - in fact, instead of those muscles strengthening, they may actually begin to atrophy, making the back pain problem worse as the body gets further out of balance.'
Put simply, shoe inserts intended for back pain relief give your feet an excuse not to be stronger. In fact, by providing artificial support that the foot should provide on its own, your foot muscles get lazy. If they do not have to do the work, they don't do it. Your muscles atrophy, or shrink and lose their normal strength to the point where they do not function normally, if at all. The result is imbalance, strain and back pain. Just propping things up with arch supports does not fix the problem of the back pain sufferer.
The ultimate message, says Gaudet, is that the right combination of stretching, exercise and strengthening is the key to back pain relief that is related to foot problems. He stresses the importance of correct diagnosis. 'Everyone and every issue is different. There is no one set of exercises or implements that will provide back pain relief. It depends on what the core problem is.'

Sciatica Shoes
Sciatica shoes are specialized footwear or insoles used to relieve the burden of chronic back and leg suffering. These devices are extremely common and can certainly make walking or standing more comfortable, especially when first used. However, just like the plethora of other
sciatica products,
shoes and insoles are unlikely to
cure sciatica
or even provide substantial relief in the long term.Advertisement:
Types of Sciatica Shoes
There are sciatica insoles and shoes in all different styles. Medical manufacturers have created varieties appropriate for every occasion, from athletic shoes to business shoes to casual shoes. Most have certain specific pain relieving mechanisms or features built into the sole of the shoe, including pressure point reduction systems, gel inserts or built-up heels to even out short leg syndrome. Most of these footwear devices are quite expensive and there is no doubt that the biggest beneficiary of these shoes is the manufacturer, due to high profit margins…
Uses for Sciatica Shoes
Specialized back pain shoes are often recommended by
chiropractors,
therapists or orthotic makers, who just happen to sell them (also at a high profit). I have seen all manner of these devices recommended for various causative conditions and have yet to meet anyone who has enjoyed a lasting cure from their use. Functional short leg syndrome is one of the biggest scam diagnoses, as anyone is likely to have one leg slightly shorter than the other at any given time. Chiropractors are really good at making this the focus of a diagnostic theory, leading to ongoing adjustments and worried patients who do not know the condition is normal and asymptomatic in 99.9% of cases… Other people try
sciatica relief
shoes for sporting events, such as running. Although these may provide good support and some cushioning, they are certainly not going to prevent sciatica, since the source is not in the feet (or even in the spine in most cases…)
Sciatica Shoes Advice
Back pain shoes are typically yet another placebo treatment used by desperate patients who will do anything, or buy anything, to find some semblance of relief. I can tell you from my own experience, as well as the letters of tens of thousands of you out there reading, that shoes are not likely to be the answer for your pain. What you need is an accurate
diagnosis,
which most of you just do not have. This explains why all the
sciatica treatments
you have tried failed so miserably. If you can achieve a correct diagnostic conclusion; you will be more than halfway to successful resolution of your pain. Until then, you are merely wandering and guessing… My advice, buy shoes you like and save your money by skipping specialized back pain shoes…Advertisement:

FLAT FEET / DROPPED ARCHES / FALLEN ARCHES (Over pronation)
It is estimated that around 80% of the population suffer from flat feet. This condition
is common in all types of people from children to the elderly and from top athletes
to people with a sedentary lifestyle.
The feet become misaligned and combined with poor posture roll inwards to gain ground
contact, the arches become flattened producing the condition known as excessive pronation.
When the feet are excessively pronated a combination of poor posture and diminished
shock absorption results in some areas of the feet being subjected to excessive stress
and pressure. This can lead to various conditions including knee and back problems,
as well as foot problems and deformities.
Professional chiropody / podiatry adhesive paddings and materials can be used to
help reduce the excessive pressure. Also with the use of orthotic insoles, it is
possible to control excessive pronation of the feet, helping them to function more
normally, reducing the stress on the feet, knees and back.
These are some of the possible resulting conditions due to poor shock absorption
in the feet.
The orthotics which we recommend for this condition are the FootSupports™ or Vasyli
orthotics.

LOW BACK PAINWhat causes Low Back Pain? Back pain is the leading cause of disability for Americans under the age of 45. Studies show that 80% of adults in America will experience low back pain at some point in their lives. The causes of back pain are as varied as the types of symptoms you may experience. Symptoms can be a result of poor muscle tone, muscle tension or spasms, ligament tears, arthritis, nerve or disc problems. Low back pain can be a result of an acute injury, but many times back problems develop over a long pe­riod of time. Factors such as age, occupation, poor posture and overall fitness all play a role. The body needs a sound support structure to carry weight and perform normal activities. When this support structure is weakened, the body must work harder to keep the feet, knees, hips and low back functioning properly. Over time, this can lead to back problems. Is my back pain related to my feet? In many cases, yes. Your feet are the foundation for every step you take. They play a key role in absorbing the shock that you place on your body every day. Problems with the function of your feet can have repercussions that are felt all the way up, including your knees, hips and back. When your arches raise and lower (which is a normal part of walking) the bones of your leg and thigh rotate inwards and outwards. When there is a problem with your feet (such as pronation or flattening of the arches), this rotation of your leg bones can become excessive – leading to increased stress on the knee, pelvis and low back. You may have noticed that your low back pain is worse in different shoes, or that walking in bare feet makes your back hurt. This may be an indication that your feet are contributing to your back pain. How is it treated? Treatment for low back pain is as varied as the number of causes. It is very important that you understand the cause of your symptoms before undergoing any treatment for your back pain. To learn more about what is causing your symptoms and your options for treatment call us at 773.878.7330. We are open 6 days a week and can accomodate Same Day appointments for Low Back Pain.Here are some of the more common treatments: Anti-Inflammatory Agents: These may include ice and oral anti-inflammatory medications. These may provide some temporary relief from the pain of inflammation, but are usually not helpful in addressing the underlying cause of your condition. In limited amounts, rest may help reduce inflammation as well. Heat can be used with some effect when your symptoms are primarily a result of muscle tightness.Conservative Therapies: There is evidence that back pain is often best treated with conservative measures initially. These treatments can include chiropractic, physical therapy, massage therapy and acupuncture. The source of back pain is often the muscles and joints in the back, which may respond to these interventions. Regardless of the type of treatment you are receiving, a good stretching and strengthening protocol can help you get better results.Injections: Depending on the cause of your pain, this intervention may be considered. There are many different types of injectional therapies including facet joints injections, trigger point injections and epidural injections. With this treatment, a steroid is injected into the area of pain and is designed to quickly reduce inflammation and decrease pain. Talk to us about the risks and benefits of this treatment.Surgery: In cases of severe injury, unrelenting and usually down-the-leg pain or in cases that do not respond to conservative measures, your doctor may recommend surgery. Surgery is often designed to take pressure off of damaged tissues and fuse areas of instability. As with other treatments, the reason why the tissues were damaged in the first place should be considered. If you are considering surgery, talk to your doctor carefully about the benefits and risks.Foot Orthotics: For back pain that is, at least partially, caused by poor biomechanics of the feet, good orthotic management is a treatment of choice. By correcting faulty or excessive motions in the feet, the posture and alignment of the lower body can be normalized. This can greatly alleviate unnecessary stress to areas of your low back. It is a simple yet profound therapy, easily performed by just standing and walking properly, and easily combined with other kinds of treatment.Sole Supports™ custom made orthotics are uniquely designed to directly and completely support and restore the arch of your foot. This not only helps correct low back posture, but restores proper function for prolonged, pain-free foot health that benefits the legs as well. It may be the difference between long-term success and failure in the management of your low back pain.Dr. Renn has advanced training in biomechanics and custom foot orthotics. We are located in Andersonville and accomodate Same Day appointments for Low Back Pain. Call us at 773.878.7330 to schedule an examination today.

Orthotics / Certified Pedorthist
Do you suffer from foot pain, knee pain, leg pain or low back pain?
Call the Collingwood Sport Medicine Clinic for an appointment with a Certified Pedorthist to see if Custom-Made Orthotics are right for you.
What is a Certified Pedorthist?
A certified pedorthist is a heath care professional who is trained and certified in the assessment, design, manufacture, fit and modification of foot appliances (i.e. orthotics) and the fitting and modification of footwear with the goal of alleviating painful or debilitating conditions of the foot and lower limb.
What is a Foot Orthotic?
A foot orthotic is a special type of insole to be worn inside a shoe. It is designed to relieve foot pain by limiting movement in unstable foot joints or by providing support to excessively stressed areas of the foot.
Foot orthotics can range from simple off-the-shelf arch supports to custom-made devices. The materials used to make them vary from firm plastic to softer foams of varying densities. Depending on the combinations used, the orthotics may be semi-rigid or soft. In general, semi-rigid orthotics provide the best combination of support and comfort. If your symptoms are mild and of short duration, and if the degree of your foot abnormality is minimal, an inexpensive off-the-shelf insole may suffice.
What should I Expect at my Appointment with a Certified Pedorthist?
An in-depth biomechanical assessment including weight bearing, non-weight bearing and range of motion testing
A gait analysis
Education in footwear features and style appropriate to your needs
If necessary, a 3-dimensional cast of the foot will be taken to create a custom-made pair of foot orthotics, designed to address your specific needs
If you are casted for orthotics, there is a Fitting which includes fine-tuning of the orthotics on-site to achieve optimal comfort and function
What are some common conditions treated by Pedorthists?
Metatarsalgia - pain in the ball of the foot
Plantar Fasciitis - pain in the heel or arch area of the foot
Numbness or Tingling in the toes
Achilles Tendinitis
Tibialis Posterior Tendinitis – shin splints
Arthritis – pain and swelling in the first toe joint and ankle
Diabetes - loss of sensation/decreased blood flow
Bunions
Callouses
Knee Pain
Hip Pain
Low Back Pain
Leg Length Difference
These conditions are treated and can be alleviated by the re-alignment of anatomical structures and the redistribution of external and internal forces in the foot through the use of orthotics. Orthotics can also help to accommodate foot deformities and improve balance.
How are Custom-Made Foot Orthotics Made?
Measurements for custom-made foot orthotics are obtained by taking a semi-weight bearing cast of the foot in a foam block. Plaster is then poured into the mold and the orthotic is constructed on the positive image of the foot.
How are Custom-Made Foot Orthotics Fitted?
When you schedule an appointment to pick up your orthotics you will be asked to bring your shoes so that the devices can be fit properly into them. The pedorthist will look at the devices under your feet to make sure that they are supporting you in the correct way and will make adjustments accordingly while you wait.
What Type of Footwear can I wear my Custom-Made Orthotics in?
Depending on the extent of your problem and the footwear that you are normally in for every day activities, different styles of custom-made orthotics can be created. These options are something that the pedorthist will go over with you during your assessment. That being said, the best type of footwear for an orthotic is a lace-up shoe that provides enough room and support for the orthotic such as a walking or running shoe.
What is a Ski boot Footbed?
Ski shops provide a type of support called a foot-bed. Foot-beds can make the boot more comfortable and improve edge control by adding inward or outward tilt to the foot. Since foot-beds gain a lot of support from the rigidity of the ski boot, they don’t necessarily need to be as substantial (or as expensive) as daily wear orthotics. However, if you are experiencing specific problems that cannot be addressed with the accommodative foot-bed, you may need to visit a Certified Pedorthist to have a custom-made pair of orthotics made for you.
What type of professional training does a Certified Pedorthist have?
To become a Canadian Certified Pedorthist one must first have a degree in a university health sciences field such as Kinesiology. The pedorthics course is offered through the University of Western Ontario and involves intense training in lower limb biomechanics, gait analysis, manufacturing and fitting of foot appliances, and fitting and modification of footwear. In order to be eligible to write the certification exams a three month internship in each of the following areas must be completed: clinical, laboratory and footwear.
More Information about Certified Pedorthists
All Certified Pedorthists in Canada are members of the Pedorthic Association of Canada and the College of Pedorthics of Canada. Information about this association and college can be found at www.pedorthic.ca and www.cpedcs.ca.
Why Choose a Certified Pedorthist?
There are currently no government standards for the making and selling of orthotic devices. As a result, many individuals with no foot care education, training or qualifications dispense supposed “custom foot orthoses” at health fairs, lifestyle, home, and sportsman shows and mall kiosks. Typically, the individuals selling these products are unqualified, unaccountable and in many cases misleading in their practices. As well, some health care professionals who are highly trained in their fields have absolutely no training in providing foot orthoses.
Certified Pedorthists have extensive training and their primary focus is in the fitting and fabricating of orthotics and in footwear modification. They have the to capability to not only do your biomechanical assessment but to make, fit and fine-tune your devices prior to dispensing them. On-site adjustments and alterations are key to proper fit and comfort.

Information about Elisa Harrison, Canadian Certified Pedorthist
Elisa Harrison
Certified Canadian Pedorthist
H.B.Sc. (KIN), PCP, C Ped (C), C Ped Tech (C)
Canadian Certified Pedorthist, Elisa Harrison, graduated from the University of Waterloo with an Honours Science degree in Kinesiology and from the University of Western Ontario with her Professional Certificate of Pedorthics.
Her patients range from young children to seniors with foot, leg, and low back pain. After completing a full biomechanical assessment and gait analysis she strives to educate patients on their condition, while recommending proper footwear specific to a patient’s needs. The custom-made foot orthotics are created from a 3-dimensional cast of the foot and are fine-tuned on-site to achieve optimal comfort and function.
Elisa is a part of Pedorthic Services, a group of Certified Pedorthists that maintain their own local lab to fabricate orthotic devices rather than sending them to a remotely located facility. This provides for quicker turn-around time and also means that adjustments or modifications to the orthotics can be easily made. Elisa is able to make most adjustments immediately, while you wait, as she has all of the necessary equipment on site.
How much will it Cost?
Technical Assessment: $75.00
Custom-Made Foot Orthotics: $460.00 (includes technical assessment)
What are the Payment Options?
Visa, Mastercard, Cheque, Cash
How long will it Take?
Turnaround time is 2 weeks from Assessment to Fitting
What do I need to Bring?
Patients must have a written referral on a physician’s prescription pad for prompt processing of claims. The referral must include a diagnosis and recommendation for custom foot orthoses for daily use.
Patients should also bring samples of the shoes worn on a regular basis at home, during activity and at work.
Are Custom-Made Orthotics covered by OHIP?
No, custom-made orthotics are not covered by OHIP. They are, however, often covered by your extended healthcare benefits. Please check your policy to determine the amount of your coverage as it varies from plan to plan.
Please note that most insurance companies require a written referral on the physician’s prescription pad in order for the devices to be covered. Please make sure to have this documentation when coming to your appointment. The referral must include a “diagnosis” and a recommendation for “custom foot orthoses”.

Acupuncture vs. Pain
The ancient practice is standing up well to modern research. Would it help you?

True believers will unhesitatingly tell you: There's hardly a health problem — from headaches to toe pain — that can't be helped by acupuncture. But until recently, it's been hard to determine one way or the other if having needles stuck in strategic points on the skin has truly been responsible for the relief patients claim. Now new research is providing answers. German studies have shown that something is definitely going on, neurologically speaking, when acupuncture needles are in place: In a series of imaging experiments involving short electric zaps to the ankle, researchers found that when acupuncture needles were inserted before the zap, the pain centers in volunteers' brains were significantly calmer.
Of course, in real life people are more likely to consider acupuncture after suffering troubling symptoms — ""usually when they haven't gotten relief from traditional medical treatment,"" says Karen Sherman, Ph.D., senior scientific investigator at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. Here, too, recent research from Germany has been positive, showing that adding acupuncture to standard medical treatment helps people with a wide variety of ailments. In these studies, involving thousands of patients, everybody got first-rate regular care — whatever their doctors recommended. Then some patients were randomly chosen to also receive up to 15 sessions of acupuncture. After three months and an average of 10 acupuncture treatments, patients were evaluated to see whether their symptoms and ability to function were substantially improved. The chart below shows how well acupuncture worked for common health woes.
To Try It Yourself
Look for a state-licensed acupuncturist experienced in treating your condition. One good source is the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (nccaom.org); most states use that organization's testing program for licensing. Before signing on, ask how many appointments it'll likely take until you know if the acupuncture will help. You probably won't be able to tell after one visit, but you don't want to ""wait 20 sessions,"" says Karen Sherman, without some relief.
The Acupuncture Advantage
For these ailments, adding acupuncture to a regimen of regular care boosted the relief patients felt, with most benefits lasting at least three months after treatment

Methodology
Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
Searches of Electronic Databases
Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
To select evidence for critical appraisal for this guideline, the Medline, EmBase and the Cochrane databases were searched for dates of January, 2002 to November, 2009 to generate an unrefined, ""combined evidence"" database using a search strategy focused on answering clinical questions relevant to acute exacerbation of asthma and employing a combination of Boolean searching on human-indexed thesaurus terms (MeSH headings using an OVID Medline interface) and ""natural language"" searching on words in the title, abstract, and indexing terms. The citations were reduced by: eliminating duplicates, review articles, non-English articles, and adult articles. The resulting abstracts were reviewed by a methodologist to eliminate low quality and irrelevant citations. During the course of the guideline development, additional clinical questions were generated and subjected to the search process, and some relevant review articles were identified. September, 2002 was the last date for which literature was reviewed for the previous version of this guideline. The details of that review strategy are documented and maintained in an asthma literature binder. However, all previous citations were reviewed for appropriateness to this revision. Any new literature encountered for this October, 2010 version was reviewed by two or more team members and then discussed as a team.

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
The recommendations contained in this guideline were formulated by an interdisciplinary working group which performed systematic search and critical appraisal of the literature, using the Table of Evidence Levels described in the ""Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence"" field, and examined current local clinical practices.
Recommendations have been formulated by a consensus process directed by best evidence, patient and family preference and clinical expertise. During formulation of these recommendations, the team members have remained cognizant of controversies and disagreements over the management of these patients. They have tried to resolve controversial issues by consensus where possible and, when not possible, to offer optional approaches to care in the form of information that includes best supporting evidence of efficacy for alternative choices.

Recommendations
Major Recommendations
The strength of the recommendation (strongly recommended, recommended, and no recommendation) and quality of the evidence (1a-5) are defined at the end of the ""Major Recommendations"" field.
Emergency Department Management
Initial History and Physical
It is recommended that before and as therapy is initiated, a brief, focused history and physical examination is obtained, including: (Local Consensus [5]; National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP], 2007 [5a])
Time of onset of current exacerbation
Current medications and allergies
Recent frequent use of beta2-agonists
Risk factors for severe, uncontrolled disease (e.g., emergency department [ED] visits, admissions to the hospital and intensive care unit [ICU], and prior intubations)
Exposure to asthma triggers
Use of peak flow with home management
Respiratory score
Note 1: Indications of more severe exacerbation include increased anxiety, decreased level of consciousness, breathlessness, diffuse wheezing or absence of air movement, increased respiratory rate, and accessory muscle use or suprasternal retractions (see Attachment 3, ""Formal Evaluation of Asthma Exacerbation Severity in the ED""; Attachment 4, ""ED Management of Asthma Exacerbations - Algorithm"" in the original guideline document and Recommendation #13 for severe asthma with respiratory distress below).
Note 2: Perform a more detailed history and physical assessment only after therapy has begun (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]).
Note 3: Patient and parental reports of medication use, peak flow values and/or environmental irritant/allergen exposure often present a more favorable description of their disease management than is actual (Dell et al., 2007 [2a]; Kamps, Roorda, & Brand, 2001 [2b]; Bender et al., 2000 [3b]; Rich et al., 2000 [3b]; Dozier, Aligne, & Schlabach, 2006 [4a]; Halterman et al., 2003 [4a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that repeat assessments of response to therapy be conducted, including clinical examination, asthma score, pulse oximetry, and lung function. In children with exacerbation, no single assessment tool appears to be best for assessing severity, treatment monitoring, or predicting admission; therefore, use of one tool may not be reliable (Sole et al., 1999 [2a]; Ribeiro de Andrade, Duarte, & Camargos, 2007 [3a]; Keahey et al., 2002 [3a]; Local Consensus [5]; British Thoracic Society & Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN], 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or peak flow monitoring be attempted in children over 5 years with mild to moderate exacerbations and who currently perform peak flow with home management (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]).
Note: Pulmonary function measurements, although often difficult to obtain in children, are useful in assessing the severity of an asthma exacerbation (Gorelick et al., 2004 [3a]). If able to obtain, and measurement is <40% of predicted (or personal best), consider adjunct therapies or admission (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Initial Treatment
Oxygen
It is recommended that supplemental oxygen be started and monitored when the oxygen saturation is consistently less than 91% and to wean oxygen when saturation is higher than 94% (Geelhoed, Landau, & Le Souef, 1994 [3a]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Short-Acting Inhaled Beta2-Agonists
It is recommended that racemic albuterol, an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) be administered as the drug of choice for rapid reversal of airflow obstruction (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]). Modify therapy based on the early clinical response to treatments (British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]) (see ""Table 1: Aerosolized Therapies – Drugs and Dosage Recommendations"" in the original guideline document).
Note: Albuterol treatments given every 10 to 20 minutes for a total of 3 doses can be given safely as initial therapy (Local Consensus [5]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that levalbuterol not be routinely used in the treatment of acute exacerbation (Local Consensus [5]).
Confusion exists regarding the selection of albuterol versus levalbuterol in the treatment of acute asthma. Although levalbuterol may prove more efficacious for some individuals, there is currently no data on how to identify these patients (Jalba, 2008 [1b]). The following information may assist in the decision to choose:
Note 1: Efficacy
Levalbuterol has demonstrated comparable efficacy to albuterol for treatment of acute exacerbations in the ED and inpatient settings (Gupta & Singh, 2007 [1b]; Ralston et al., 2005 [2a]; Carl et al., 2003 [2a]; Andrews et al., 2009 [2b]; Hardasmalani et al., 2005 [2b]; Qureshi et al., 2005 [3a]). A large double-blind prospective trial demonstrated a 10% reduction in hospital admissions with the use of levalbuterol (Carl et al., 2003 [2a]) and a retrospective review of consecutive cases demonstrated a 4.5% reduction (Schreck & Babin, 2005 [4a]). The numbers needed to treat (NNT) with levalbuterol to prevent one hospital admission in these studies equals 11 and 10 respectively (Carl et al., 2003 [2a]; Schreck & Babin, 2005 [4a]).
Note: 2: Side effect reduction
Difference in the reduction of adverse events such as tachycardia, tremor, or increase in blood pressure has not been demonstrated when equivalent doses of levalbuterol and albuterol have been studied (Andrews et al., 2009 [2b]). The use of racemic albuterol with metered dose inhaler (MDI) has been shown to result in lower pulse rates when compared to nebulizer (Cates, Crilly, & Rowe, 2006 [1a]; Mathew & Singh, 2008 [1b]; Deerojanawong et al., 2005 [2b]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]). This may be an important consideration for children at risk for tachycardia including children with congenital heart disease or known arrhythmias (Local Consensus [5]).
Note 3: Cost
Given that there appears to be no safety advantage to the use of levalbuterol, and the ability to identify patients who have a differential treatment response, the greatly increased cost of the drug would argue against its use in the general population. Discussion of the safety and cost factors with parents may assist in the selection process (Local Consensus [5]).
Inhalation Delivery Device Selection
Devices used for the delivery of bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids can be equally efficacious.
It is recommended that when selecting an inhalation delivery device consideration be given to the following (Dolovich et al., 2005 [1a]; Scarfone et al., 2002 [3b]):
Device/drug availability
Patient ability to use the selected device correctly
Device use with multiple medications
Cost and reimbursement
Drug administration time
Convenience in both outpatient and inpatient settings
Physician and patient preference
Note 1: In children and adolescents with acute asthma exacerbation, no significant difference exists for responses such as time to recovery of asthma symptoms, repeat visits, or hospital admissions when medications are delivered via MDI with Valved Holding Chamber (VHC) or nebulizer (Mathew & Singh, 2008 [1b]; Delgado et al., 2003 [2a]; Jamalvi et al., 2006 [3a]; Benito-Fernandez et al., 2004 [3a]; Yilmaz et al., 2009 [4a]). Within this guideline, a spacer is defined as a Valved Holding Chamber or ""delivery"" device that has a one-way valve inside that prevents the medicine from escaping once you have pressed down on the MDI canister (Local Consensus [5]). Spacers improve the clinical effect of inhaled medications, especially in patients unable to use an MDI properly (Lavorini & Fontana, 2009 [5b]). The use of large volume spacers has been recommended for any inhaled asthma drug in young children, and as a means of reducing systemic bioavailability of inhaled corticosteroids in adults and children alike (Newman, 2004 [5a]). One study has demonstrated the percent difference of drug deposition into the lung as 4.9% to 10.9% with spacer use compared to no spacer. This represents a range of approximately 52% to 87% increase in drug deposition (Vidgren & Paronen, 1987 [4b]).
Note 2: MDIs have been shown to shorten time to discharge from the ED, to improve pulmonary function measures, and to result in lower pulse rates when compared to nebulizer (Cates, Crilly, & Rowe, 2006 [1a]; Castro-Rodriguez & Rodrigo, 2004 [1a]; Mathew & Singh, 2008 [1b]; Deerojanawong et al., 2005 [2b]; Boyd & Stuart, 2005 [3a]; Local Consensus [5]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]).
Note 3: The inhalation route for SABA administration is considered optimal. Subcutaneous SABAs (epinephrine, terbutaline) provide no proven advantage over inhaled medication (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). Intravenous SABAs have not been shown to improve pulmonary physiology or outcomes compared to inhaled routes (Travers et al., 2001 [1a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Inhaled Ipratropium Bromide
It is recommended that inhaled ipratropium be added to SABA and corticosteroid therapies for children presenting with moderate or severe acute exacerbations or when the FEV1 is <50% of predicted (Plotnick & Ducharme, 2009 [1a]; Rodrigo & Castro-Rodriquez, 2005 [1a]; Dotson et al., 2009 [1b]; Local Consensus [5]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Hayday & Stevermer, 2002 [5a]) (see ""Table 1: Aerosolized Therapies – Drugs and Dosage Recommendations"" in the original guideline document).
Note 1: Adding multiple doses (up to 3 doses) of anticholinergics to SABAs appears safe, improves lung function and avoids hospital admission in 1 of 12 school-aged children with severe exacerbation (number needed to treat [NNT] = 12) (Plotnick & Ducharme, 2009 [1a]).
Note 2: Although ipratropium has been shown to be efficacious in preventing hospitalizations for children with exacerbations where FEV1 is <50% of predicted, it has not been shown to provide significant benefit after the child is hospitalized; therefore, it is not a standard therapy to be considered in the inpatient management of acute exacerbations (Plotnick & Ducharme, 2009 [1a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Corticosteroids
It is recommended that oral corticosteroids be administered to patients who do not respond completely to initial inhaled SABAs (Edmonds et al., 2009 [1a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]) (see ""Table 2: Corticosteroids – Drugs and Dosage Recommendations"" in the original guideline document).
Note 1: Corticosteroids speed the resolution of airflow obstruction, reduce the rate of relapse, and may reduce hospitalizations, especially if administered within one hour of presentation to the ED (Rowe et al., ""Early emergency,"" 2009 [1a]; Edmonds et al., 2009 [1a]).
Note 2: Oral prednisone has effects equivalent to those of intravenous methylprednisolone including tolerance by children (Rowe et al., ""Early emergency,"" 2009 [1a]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]).
Note 3: For treatment of acute exacerbation, insufficient evidence exists for inhaled corticosteroid therapy alone or as an additive benefit when used with systemic corticosteroids (Edmonds et al., 2009 [1a]; Schuh et al., 2006 [2b]; Nakanishi, Klasner, & Rubin, 2003 [2b]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Camargo, Rachelefsky, & Schatz, 2009 [5b]).
Note 4: If the patient is on routine inhaled steroids for chronic control it is not necessary to stop their use during exacerbation. The inhaled corticosteroids can be started at any time regardless of oral dosing for the exacerbation (Local Consensus [5]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 5: It is recognized that many children will have problems with treatment adherence due to an oral aversion to medicine, especially bitter-tasting corticosteroid preparations. In such cases, alternatives such as intramuscularly administered dexamethasone, oral dexamethasone, and orally administered intravenous versions of corticosteroids have been proven efficacious (Rowe et al., ""Early emergency,"" 2009 [1a]; Smith et al., 2009 [1a]; Gordon, Tompkins, & Dayan, 2007 [2a]; Altamimi et al., 2006 [2a]; Qureshi, Zaritsky, & Poirier, 2001 [2a]; Greenberg, Kerby, & Roosevelt, 2008 [2b]; Huang et al., 2007 [2b]; Gries et al., 2000 [2b]).
Adjunctive Therapies
Magnesium Sulfate
It is recommended in children with moderate to severe exacerbations who are minimally responsive or unresponsive to initial treatment (SABA, oral corticosteroids, and ipratropium), that intravenous magnesium sulfate be administered (Rowe et al., ""Magnesium sulfate,"" 2009 [1a]; Mohammed & Goodacre, 2007 [1a]; Ciarallo, Brousseau, & Reinert, 2000 [2b]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]) (see ""Table 3: Adjunctive Therapies – Drugs and Dosage Recommendations"" in the original guideline document).
Note 1: In patients with acute exacerbation who have been maximized on standard therapy, intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and to improve lung function without significant side effects. Possible side effects to be aware of include hypotension, hypotonia, or abnormal reflexes when given doses above that recommended for asthma (Rowe et al., ""Magnesium sulfate,"" 2009 [1a]; Mohammed & Goodacre, 2007 [1a]; Alter, Koepsell, & Hilty, 2000 [1a]).
Note 2: There is insufficient evidence regarding the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate in acute exacerbation (Blitz et al., 2009 [1b]).
Epinephrine and Terbutaline
It is recommended for patients who are minimally responsive or responding poorly to SABA/ipratropium/systemic corticosteroid/magnesium sulfate therapies, or who are unable to tolerate aerosol treatments, that parenteral epinephrine or terbutaline be considered (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]) see ""Table 3: Adjunctive Therapies – Drugs and Dosage Recommendations"" in the original guideline document).
Heliox
There is insufficient evidence and lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of heliox in acute exacerbation of asthma to make a recommendation for its routine use (Rivera et al., 2006 [2b]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]).
Note: Heliox-driven albuterol nebulization may be considered for patients who have life- threatening exacerbation or who remain in severe exacerbation after intensive conventional adjunctive therapy (Rodrigo et al., 2006 [1a]; Kim et al., 2005 [2b]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). In one small study, improvement in respiratory score and shorter ED length of stay were seen when heliox was administered in moderate and severe exacerbation (Kim et al., 2005 [2b]).
Severe Asthma with Respiratory Distress and Normal Mental Status
It is recommended that multiple therapies as described below be started simultaneously while either a consult from the Pediatric Intensive Care is requested or transport to a higher level of care is arranged (Local Consensus [5]) (see ""Table 3: Adjunctive Therapies – Drugs and Dosage Recommendations"" in the original guideline document).
Administer:
Continuous albuterol
Ipratropium bromide, up to 3 doses
Systemic corticosteroids (dexamethasone intramuscular [IM] or methylprednisolone [IV])
Epinephrine IM
Magnesium sulfate IV
Consider terbutaline IV bolus, and infusion
Timing of Disposition from the Emergency Department
The response to initial treatment in the ED after a period of observation is a better predictor of the need for hospitalization than is the severity of an exacerbation (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that the current severity of the exacerbation be in the ""mild"" range when evaluating a child for discharge from ED or hospital (Local Consensus [5]) (see Attachment 3, ""Formal Evaluation of Asthma Exacerbation Severity in ED or Urgent Care Setting"", and Attachment 4, ""ED Management of Asthma Exacerbations - Algorithm"" in the original guideline document).
Note 1: In the ED, if initial severity is moderate or severe, then the severity assessment 1 hour after treatment is better than initial severity assessment for determining the need for hospital admission as well as for predicting the need for intensive care unit in patients initially assessed as severe (Kelly, Kerr, & Powell, 2004 [3a]; Local Consensus [5]).
Note 2: In acute childhood asthma, a repeat pulse oximetry of <92 to 94% at 1 hour after treatment better predicts need for hospitalization than the initial pulse oximetry (Kelly, Kerr, & Powell, 2004 [3a]; Wright et al., 1997 [3b]; Local Consensus [5]).
Inpatient Management
General Therapy
It is recommended, with the exception of the use of anticholinergics such as ipratropium, that usual inpatient hospital management be viewed as a continuation of any therapies initiated in the ED including (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]):
Aerosolized bronchodilators
Oxygen
Corticosteroids
Initiation and continuation of controller (anti-inflammatory) agents
Continued assessment
Intermittent assessment of oxygen saturation
FEV1 or peak expiratory flow (PEF) on admission, 15 to 20 minutes after bronchodilator therapy during acute phase and daily until discharge (in children >5 years of age if able to perform).
Failure to Progress
It is recommended that the following care be initiated for patients who fail to progress after 12 hours of care (Local Consensus [5]):
Notify treating healthcare provider of any child that has not progressed after 12 hours of care
Assessment:
Physical examination and respiratory score
Explore reason/s for failure to progress (e.g., poor SABA responder, pneumonia or other diagnosis, suboptimal steroid dose or suboptimal frequency of administration)
Escalate plan based on assessment findings
Treatment considerations, as indicated:
Albuterol treatments every 10 to 20 minutes for 3 doses or continuous albuterol administered over 30 minutes, and reassess
Chest x-ray
Administer or re-administer IV steroid if greater than or equal to 12 hours since last dose (oral or IM if cannot acquire IV access)
Venous or capillary blood gas
If status is improved after treatment escalation, then reassess hourly
If status is not improved, discuss potential for transfer to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or higher level of care
Consider subspecialty consult
Decompensation
It is recommended that the following care be initiated for the patient whose condition is assessed as decompensating from a prior stabilized state: (this is not for the patient in an obvious medical emergency for whom a medical code needs to be initiated) (Local Consensus [5]):
Albuterol treatments every 10 to 20 minutes for a total of 3 doses or continuous albuterol over 30 minutes, and reassess
Initiate the Medical Response Team (MRT) or the team responsible for immediate assessment of a child with a change in condition
Notify treating healthcare provider that child is decompensating
Assess for treatment escalation options:
Consider other adjunctive medications
Epinephrine IM
Ipratropium unless previously given
Magnesium sulfate unless previously given
Administer or readminister steroid if indicated (oral, IM, or IV if available)
Insert IV
Portable chest x-ray
Prohibit eating or drinking; nothing by mouth (NPO)
Consider capillary or venous blood gas
Consider subspecialty consult
Reassess after treatment escalation
If improved, resume hourly assessment
If not improved, transfer to PICU or higher level of care
Consistency of Care
It is recommended that available protocols such as clinical pathways or protocols be used, directing consistent provision of care for patients presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation (British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). At Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, such protocol usage includes:
Asthma clinical order set
Aerosol and oxygen protocol
Note: Use of a clinical pathway or designated care providers for inpatient management has been shown to decrease length of stay, use of SABA therapy, nursing and laboratory costs, and to improve quality of care with no increase in readmission rates (Johnson et al., 2000 [2a]; McDowell et al., 1998 [2a]; Norton et al., 2007 [4a]; Wazeka et al., 2001 [4a]; Ebbinghaus & Bahrainwala, 2003 [4b]; Kelly et al., 2000 [4b]).
Complementary and Alternative Medicine
It is recommended that the clinician ask patients/parents about all medications and treatments they are using for asthma (Local Consensus [5]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 1: A high level of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been reported in several studies: 45% of care providers reported using herbal products with their children (Lanski et al., 2003 [3a]), 63% of adolescents reported the use of complementary medicine when surveyed (Reznik et al., 2002 [3a]), and a review of literature of CAM use in asthma found the level ranged from 33% to 89% in studies of children and adolescents (Mark, 2007 [1b]). Currently there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of CAM therapies (Altunc, Pittler, & Ernst, 2007 [1a]; Hondras, Linde, & Jones, 2005 [1a]; Mark, 2007 [1b]).
Note 2: Patients who use herbal treatments may need caution regarding the potential for harmful ingredients in herbal treatments and interactions with asthma medications (Lanski et al., 2003 [3a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that acupuncture not be used for the treatment of asthma. No evidence of an effect of acupuncture in reducing asthma symptoms has been demonstrated (McCarney et al., 2009 [1a]; Martin et al., 2002 [1a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
ED or Inpatient Management
Screening
It is recommended that systematic screening be conducted using a broad assessment tool, such as Child Asthma Risk Assessment Tool (CARAT) for identification of risks including medical, environmental, adherence, financial, psychosocial or health literacy (Local Consensus [5]). The CARAT may be accessed via the following URL: http://carat.asthmarisk.org
Consultations
It is recommended that the need for consultations be considered at the time of presentation or as early as possible in the acute course (Local Consensus [5]).
Medical Consultation: Usual indications for medical consultation (usually, a fellowship-trained allergist or pulmonologist; occasionally, other physicians who have expertise in asthma management, developed through additional training and experience) in childhood asthma include (Local Consensus [5]; NAEPP 2007 [5a]):
The diagnosis of asthma is in question
Current life-threatening or severe asthma exacerbation possibly requiring medical response team (MRT)
Poor-responder or requiring escalation in routine care or unexplained deterioration
Repeated life-threatening hospital admissions, history of intensive care admission, frequent ED visits for asthma
Patient has required more than two bursts of oral corticosteroids in the past 12 months
Any exacerbation requiring hospitalization in the last 12 months
Evaluation for addition or discontinuation of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) therapy
Conditions complicating asthma or its diagnosis (e.g., sinusitis, nasal polyps, aspergillosis, severe rhinitis, vocal cord dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Need for extensive education and guidance on allergen avoidance, problems with adherence to therapy and poor control, or complications of therapy.
Mental Health Consultation: Patients who have significant psychiatric, psychosocial, or family problems that interfere with their asthma therapy may need referral to an appropriate mental health professional for counseling or treatment.
Social Service Consultation: Indications for considering social service consultation include:
Family's social or financial difficulties might be impediments to adherence with the treatments and medical follow-up
Family resources are compromised or uncertain
Interpreter Services Consultation: Indication for considering services:
Family in need of language interpretation
Pharmacist Consultation: Indications for considering pharmacist consultation (where available) include review of the medication regimen of a patient admitted for asthma exacerbation.
Note: Medication regimen evaluation may include: screening for adverse drug reactions, screening for drug interactions, ensuring appropriate medication use and dosing, appropriate route of administration, appropriate dosing intervals and/or comparison of the medication reconciliation record with the current medication orders (Sanghera et al., 2006 [1a]; Kaushal et al., 2008 [3a]).
Therapies Generally NOT Recommended
It is recommended that theophylline or aminophylline not be administered routinely in the ED or hospitalized patient because they do not appear to provide additional benefit to optimal SABA therapy (D'Avila et al., 2008 [2b]) and may increase frequency of adverse effects in acute exacerbation (Mitra et al., 2009 [1a]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 3: Patients using theophylline as outpatients may continue on their usual doses in the hospital; obtaining a therapeutic level while the child is hospitalized may be considered, because illness can affect serum levels. Additionally, a pharmacist consult may be useful for review of drug interactions (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that antibiotics not be used routinely for acute asthma exacerbations in the absence of an identified bacterial focus (Graham, Lasserson, & Rowe, 2009 [1a]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]; Blasi & Johnston, 2007 [5b]).
It is recommended that aggressive rehydration not be used routinely for acute asthma exacerbation in the absence of clinical dehydration (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that chest physiotherapy (CPT), incentive spirometry, and mucolytics not be used routinely for acute asthma exacerbations as they can trigger bronchospasm or worsen cough or air flow obstruction during an acute asthma attack (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs not be used routinely for acute asthma exacerbations outside of an intensive care setting, as they may cause respiratory depression (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that oral albuterol not be used for acute exacerbation (Local Consensus [5]).
Therapy Cautions/Considerations
It is recommended that for therapies outlined in this section, caution and consideration be used in treatment selections (Local Consensus [5]).
Ibuprofen: In children without known aspirin induced asthma (AIA), ibuprofen may be a better choice than acetaminophen for the treatment of fever/pain in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbations. Acetaminophen has been associated with an increased risk of wheezing (Kanabar, 2007 [1a]; Karimi, Mirzaei, & Ahmadieh, 2006 [4a]).
In children with known AIA, it is prudent to counsel parents regarding the potential for cross-sensitivities to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Debley et al., 2005 [1a]). This patient population demonstrates less cross-sensitivity to acetaminophen.
Cross-Sensitivities (Jenkins, Costello, & Hodge, 2004 [1a]):
Ibuprofen ≤400mg, 98%
Naproxen ≤100mg, 100%
Diclofenac ≤40mg, 93%
Acetaminophen ≥500mg, 7%
Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists
Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) and increases in asthma mortality. Concern remains that symptomatic benefit from treatment with LABAs might lead to underestimation of acute attack severity and long-term use could lead to tolerance to their bronchodilator effects (Cates, Lasserson, & Jaeschke, ""Regular treatment with salmeterol,"" 2009 [1a], Cates, Lasserson, & Jaeschke, ""Regular treatment with formoterol,"" 2009 [1a]). In addition, recent analyses by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and others concluded that use of LABAs is associated with an increased risk of severe worsening of asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalization in both children and adults and death in some patients with asthma (Salpeter, Wall, & Buckley, 2010 [1a]; Walters et al., 2007 [1a]; Salpeter et al., 2006 [1a]; FDA, 2010 [5]). The FDA is requiring further studies for safety evaluation and has concluded that although these medicines play an important role in helping some patients control asthma symptoms, their use be limited to patients whose asthma cannot be controlled with inhaled corticosteroids alone (FDA, 2010 [5]). There is no good evidence as to which subpopulation would benefit or be harmed with use of a LABA. One recent study, evaluating step-up therapy in children, concluded that response to LABA was more likely to provide a better response compared to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA). However many children had a best response to ICS or LTRA step-up, highlighting the need to regularly monitor and appropriately adjust each child's asthma therapy within this level of care before further step-up (Lemanske et al., 2010 [2a]).
Until further studies are concluded, it is suggested that all patients treated with LABA be individually evaluated to ensure that this is the best option for asthma control (Cates, Lasserson, & Jaeschke, ""Regular treatment with salmeterol,"" 2009 [1a], Cates, Lasserson, & Jaeschke, ""Regular treatment with formoterol,"" 2009 [1a]). Such evaluation may best be performed in conjunction with an asthma specialist (Local Consensus [5]) (see Recommendation #35 below for evaluation of LABA use).
Disparities in quality of care: When treating children with asthma, it is important to consider the socioeconomic factors that might lead to avoidable hospitalizations and premature mortality (Cope, Unger, & Glazier, 2008 [4a]; Gupta, Carrion-Carire, & Weiss, 2006 [4a]). Special consideration of the following conditions assists in the provision of patient-centered, equitable care:
Medicaid-covered, minority children have worse asthma status (parental report) and are less likely to be using preventive, anti-inflammatory agents than white children (Ferris et al., 2006 [4a]; Lieu et al., 2002 [4a]).
Children uninsured or on Medicaid have ranked significantly lower on seven quality measures including ED utilization, prescriptions from the ED, and access to and use of a primary care provider (Lara et al., 2003 [2a]; Knudson et al., 2009 [4a]; Wilson et al., 2005 [4a]; Ferris et al., 2001 [4a]).
Black children demonstrate more likelihood to have asthma and to experience ED visits for asthma, compared with otherwise comparable white children (Flores et al., 2005 [3a]; Jones et al., 2008 [4a]).
The effect of comorbid conditions and mental illness in mothers of asthmatic children has recently been shown to impact asthma control and health services utilization related to asthma (Coughlan, Gibson, & Henry, 2001 [1a]; Bartlett et al., 2001 [3a]; Belamarich, 2000 [3a]; Rodriguez et al., 2002 [4a]; Shalowitz et al., 2001 [4a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]) (see Recommendation #22 above, Consultations, Social Services).
Discharge/Transition Preparation
Although this guideline is focused on the acute management of asthma exacerbations, it is recognized that asthma is a chronic disease. Discharge planning is intended to assist the transition from the acute exacerbation to chronic management, identifying factors within the chronic action plan that may need adjusting to prevent future exacerbations and improve long-term patient outcomes. The transition plan is expected to enhance the likelihood that the family, and ultimately the child, will become skilled in self-management of this chronic condition. Early planning is important to assure that problems with details associated with follow-up have been resolved prior to discharge.
Recommendations for comprehensive management of chronic asthma can be found in the most recent update of the national asthma guideline (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that planning for discharge begin when the child first presents to the ED or hospital unit (Local Consensus [5]).
It is recommended that prior to discharge the patient undergo Severity Classification of chronic asthma (see Attachment 5, ""Severity Classification"" in the original guideline document). This will support a patient-centered approach to therapy (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). Also, Severity Classification may be useful to the primary care provider in identifying children with special health care needs and facilitating care coordination (Local Consensus [5]).
It is recommended that case or care management by trained health professionals be considered for patients who have poorly controlled asthma and have recurrent visits to the ED or hospital. Care-management processes are tools to improve the efficiency and quality of primary care delivery, self management, and have demonstrated a reduction in ED visits (Schulte et al., 2004 [1b]; Levy et al., 2006 [2a]; Walders et al., 2006 [2a]; Griffiths et al., 2004 [2a]; Portnoy & Jennings, 2006 [4a]; Rosen & Rodriguez, 2006 [4a]; Spiegel et al., 2006 [4a]; Wood et al., 2006 [4a]; Allcock, 2009 [4b]; Case Management Society of America [CMSA], 2010 [5]).
It is recommended, before the patient is discharged from the ED or inpatient unit, that education be provided that is tailored to the identified needs, beliefs, and learning styles of the patient and family and addresses identified patient-desired outcomes (Zorc, Scarfone, & Li, 2005 [2a]; Local Consensus [5]; Mansour, 2009 [5a]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 1: When usual care for asthma was compared to more intensive educational programs (provided in either the ED, hospital, home or clinic), reduction in subsequent ED visits and hospital admissions occurred in those receiving intensive education (Boyd et al., 2009 [1a]; Wolf et al., 2008 [1a]; Karnick et al., 2007 [2a]; Brown et al., 2006 [2a]; Ng et al., 2006 [2a]; Sockrider et al., 2006 [2a]). The most effective type, duration or intensity of education has not been determined (Boyd et al., 2009 [1a]; Coffman et al., 2008 [1a]; Wolf et al., 2008 [1a]; Zorc et al., 2009 [2a]). Patient-centered, specific education efforts may be more effective than general or poorly targeted interventions (Canino et al., 2008 [2a]; Forbis & Aligne, 2002 [2b]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 2: Asthma education plans have been successfully implemented in busy EDs (Boychuk et al., 2006 [3a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Components of education programs have not been comparatively studied; however, programs that have demonstrated improvement have included the following components: (Boyd et al., 2009 [1a]; Coffman et al., 2008 [1a]; Wolf et al., 2008 [1a])
Etiology, prognosis, and risk factors emphasizing chronicity of condition
Medication purpose, and when and how to use medications (Smith et al., 2008 [4a])
Provision or updating of written asthma plan
Note: Parental attitudes toward and knowledge of asthma (pathophysiology, medications, action plans, and environmental triggers) influenced adherence to prescribed asthma medications and action plans in several studies (Jones et al., 2002 [2a]; Douglass et al., 2002 [2b]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Identification of environmental triggers for prevention of acute exacerbations (Lanphear et al., ""Residential Exposure,"" 2001 [4a], Lanphear et al., ""Contribution,"" 2001 [4a]) (see Attachment 6, ""How to Control What Makes Your Asthma Worse"" in the original guideline document).
Note: Multifaceted allergen education and control interventions delivered in the home setting have been shown to be effective in reducing exposures to cockroach, rodent, and dust-mite allergens and associated asthma morbidity (Arshad et al., 2007 [2a]; Morgan et al., 2004 [2a]; Schonberger et al., 2004 [2a]; Moira et al., 2002 [2a]; Custovic et al., 2001 [2a]; Finn et al., 2000 [3a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Demonstration of correct use of inhaler/spacer (Hussain-Rizvi, Kunkov, & Crain, 2009 [2b]) (see Attachment 7, ""How to Use Your MDI"" in the original guideline document)
Demonstration of peak flow technique if sending home with peak flow meter – (for patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma or a history of severe exacerbations, or patients who are poor perceivers of airflow obstruction) (see Attachment 8, ""Peak Flow Use"" in the original guideline document)
Note: Peak flow measurement can be a useful addition for severity assessment of an asthma exacerbation and is most useful in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma (McMullen, Yoos, & Kitzman, 2002 [2a]; Yoos et al., 2002 [2a]). It can be used in short-term monitoring, acute exacerbations, and daily chronic monitoring (Goldberg et al., 2001 [4a]; Brand et al., 1999 [4a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Home management of exacerbation or relapse including evaluation of early clinical signs and symptoms of airway inflammation.
Note: Beginning treatment at home may avoid treatment delays, prevent exacerbations from becoming severe, and also adds to patients' sense of control over their asthma. The degree of care provided in the home depends on the patients' (or parents') abilities and experience and on the availability of emergency care (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). Accurate evaluation of symptom severity by parents and children will assist to avoid delays in care and inappropriate home management (Garbutt et al., 2009 [2a]).
Importance and purpose of follow-up appointment – explore action plan, evaluate patient goal attainment, identify barriers to meeting activity goals, identify potential treatment adjustments to help meet goals and prevent future exacerbations (Zorc, Scarfone, & Li, 2005 [2a]; Zorc et al., 2003 [2a]; Flores et al., 2005 [3a]):
Schedule before discharge for hospitalized patient 1 to 5 days after discharge
Contact primary care provider before discharge from ED
Importance of continual and consistent care in outpatient setting, partnering with primary care provider to tailor interventions toward the child's goals for activity
Provision of asthma specialists resource information if indicated
It is recommended that SABAs be used at home on an as-needed basis after recovery from an acute asthma exacerbation (Walters & Walters, 2002 [1a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). If patient's need is greater than 6 puffs every 3 to 4 hours by 24 to 48 hours after discharge provide family with instruction to seek medical care (Local Consensus [5]).
It is recommended that if a LABA was in use before admission, it be suspended during hospitalization for exacerbation and the patient be evaluated for continuation of therapy after discharge (Local Consensus [5]; British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]).
Note 1: There is no evidence that continuing a LABA during exacerbation is beneficial and concern remains regarding harm with its continued use.
Note 2: The beneficial effects of LABA in combination therapy for the patients who require more therapy than low-dose ICS alone to control asthma need to be weighed against the potential increased risk of severe exacerbations, associated with the daily use of LABAs in some patients (Cates, Lasserson, & Jaeschke, ""Regular treatment with salmeterol,"" 2009 [1a], Cates, Lasserson, & Jaeschke, ""Regular treatment with formoterol,"" 2009 [1a]; Nelson et al., 2006 [2a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Consider consultation with an asthma specialist for questions regarding continuation of LABA following hospital discharge (Local Consensus [5]).
Note 3: In February of 2010 the FDA announced new safety controls for LABAs as follows:
""LABAs are contraindicated without the use of an asthma controller medication such as inhaled corticosteroid, and should not be used alone"" (FDA, 2010 [5]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
""LABAs ought to only be used long-term in patients whose asthma cannot be adequately controlled on other asthma controller medications"" (FDA, 2010 [5]).
""LABAs ought to only be used for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved"" (FDA, 2010 [5]).
Note 4: Of the adjunctive therapies available, LABAs are the preferred therapy to combine with ICS in youths ≥12 years of age and adults (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 5: For patients ≥5 years of age who have moderate persistent asthma or asthma inadequately controlled on low-dose ICS, the option to increase the ICS dose may be given equal weight to the option of adding LABA (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]). A recent study suggests that patients are most likely to have a differential response to the addition of LABA to low dose ICS compared to increasing ICS or adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist. However, the safety of long term use of LABA remains uncertain (Lemanske et al., 2010 [2a]).
Note 6: For patients ≥5 years of age who have severe persistent asthma or asthma inadequately controlled, the combination of LABA and ICS is the preferred therapy (NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note 7: For patients <4 years of age, there is insufficient evidence for use of a LABA. These drugs are not labeled for use in this age group. Consider consultation with an asthma specialist for questions regarding this subset of asthma patients before adding LABA therapy (Local Consensus [5]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that patients already on ICS continue ICS therapy after discharge from ED or inpatient setting. Consider initiating ICS for patients with persistent asthma if not already receiving (British Thoracic Society & SIGN, 2008 [5a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note: Initiating ICS at discharge for patients not already on ICS has demonstrated a decreased risk of subsequent ED visits for patients with persistent asthma (Sin & Man, 2002 [4a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended, when possible, that long term controller medications and medicines to complete exacerbation therapy are provided to the patient prior to discharge (Qureshi, Zaritsky, & Poirier, 2001 [2a]; Cooper & Hickson, 2001 [4a]).
Note: Prescriptions are not always filled after discharge (Qureshi, Zaritsky, & Poirier, 2001 [2a]; Cooper & Hickson, 2001 [4a]). Outcomes demonstrated from prescriptions not filled have been an increase in missed school and work days (Qureshi, Zaritsky, & Poirier, 2001 [2a]). It is also believed that providing medicines will result in decrease readmission rates (Local Consensus [5]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
It is recommended that patients have a written plan that reflects adjustments necessary due to the current exacerbation and includes a stepwise approach coordinating with the child's plan for chronic management (Zemek, Bhogal, & Ducharme, 2008 [1a]; Bhogal, Zemek, & Ducharme, 2006 [1a]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]) (see Attachment 9, ""Stepwise Approaching to Managing Asthma in Children"" in the original guideline document).
It is recommended that every attempt be made to schedule the follow-up appointment before the child is discharged from the facility. When this is not possible, attempt to notify the primary care provider of the current exacerbation event (Zorc, Scarfone, & Li, 2005 [2a]; Zorc et al., 2003 [2a]; Local Consensus [5]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Note: A significant number of patients from the Cincinnati population consider the ED their regular source of care, and a commonly held health belief is that the ED is the appropriate place to seek care for a breathing problem (Mansour, Lanphear, & DeWitt, 2000 [2b]). Having fewer general practice contacts in the previous year has been independently associated with an increased risk of fatal asthma, increasing the importance of the follow-up visit either with the primary care provider or asthma specialist (Local Consensus [5]; NAEPP, 2007 [5a]).
Discharge Readiness
Ongoing assessment will provide the needed information of the patient progression to determine the readiness for discharge. Discharge readiness usually includes the following:
Child stable on therapies that can be administered at home
Home environment is able to safely fulfill discharge plan
Sufficient knowledge of asthma to manage care at home or seek help if symptoms worsen
Arrangements for any special medications or equipment required for home therapies are complete
Transition plan based on admission screening is complete and reflects the patients continuum of care needs
Follow-up care is arranged, coordinating with primary care provider or asthma specialist if indicated, and providers agree with plans.

Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
Potential Benefits
Appropriate medical treatment and management of acute asthma exacerbations in children as demonstrated by:
Resolution of acute episode with use of appropriate therapies and decreasing the use of unnecessary therapies
Reduced risk of readmission to the emergency department or inpatient unit
Maintained and improved patient/family satisfaction with treatment
Potential Harms
Dosages in excess of 1 mg/kg of prednisone or prednisolone (sodium succinate) have been associated with adverse behavioral effects in children.
It is recognized that many children will have problems with treatment adherence due to an oral aversion to medicine, especially bitter-tasting corticosteroid preparations.
Possible side effects of magnesium sulfate to be aware of include hypotension, hypotonia, or abnormal reflexes when given doses above that recommended for asthma.
Acetaminophen has been associated with an increased risk of wheezing. In children with known aspirin induced asthma (AIA), it is prudent to counsel parents regarding the potential for cross-sensitivities to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) and increases in asthma mortality. Concern remains that symptomatic benefit from treatment with LABAs might lead to underestimation of acute attack severity and long-term use could lead to tolerance to their bronchodilator effects. In addition, recent analyses by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and others concluded that use of LABAs is associated with an increased risk of severe worsening of asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalization in both children and adults and death in some patients with asthma.
Difference in the reduction of adverse events such as tachycardia, tremor, or increase in blood pressure has not been demonstrated when equivalent doses of levalbuterol and albuterol have been studied. The use of racemic albuterol with metered dose inhaler (MDI) has been shown to result in lower pulse rates when compared to nebulizer. This may be an important consideration for children at risk for tachycardia including children with congenital heart disease or known arrhythmias.
Exercise caution in managing children with comorbid conditions such as:
Congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease
Cystic fibrosis
Chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia
Immunodeficiency syndromes

Contraindications
Contraindications
Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are contraindicated without the use of an asthma controller medication such as inhaled corticosteroid, and should not be used alone.

Chronic Asthma Information
By
Allan Wilson
Not everyone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffers from chronic asthma, but many individuals who experience emphysema or chronic bronchitis have asthma-like symptoms. Medical experts continue to debate whether chronic asthma should be classified as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, since asthma can be reversed. Chronic asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways; the term asthma is derived from an ancient Greek word which means panting. With chronic asthma, the inflammation leads to the narrowing of the airways, which can cause wheezing, breathlessness, and gasping for air. Studies indicate that chronic asthma involves two stages: the hyper-reactive response and the inflammatory response. The hyper-reactive response in chronic asthma refers to the constriction of the airways in response to inhaled irritants, while the inflammatory stage involves the production of white blood cells in the airways. During a chronic asthma attack, the muscle tissue in the walls of the bronchi experiences spasms, causing labored breathing. With chronic asthma, coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing occur almost everyday. In order to combat chronic asthma, several medications may be needed. Some medical experts speculate that the persistent symptoms of chronic asthma indicate a food allergy. As a result, some doctors encourage those suffering from chronic asthma to revise their diets in order to reduce the incidence of flare-ups. There are some other simple strategies one can follow in order to alleviate symptoms of chronic asthma. These include removing the cause of chronic asthma, treating the symptoms, or altering the host to be more tolerant of the causes. If you've been diagnosed with chronic asthma, medical experts suggest stopping all smoking and banning cigarette smoke from the house. Chronic asthma patients should also stop the use of volatile chemicals, which may exacerbate one's symptoms. Ending contact with pets can also alleviate chronic asthma. The aims of any treatment program for chronic asthma should include: avoiding the trigger factors for chronic asthma, eliminating symptoms, restoring normal lung function, reducing the incidence of severe attacks, and minimizing the side-effects of drugs. Drug therapy for chronic asthma can fall into three categories. Chronic asthma can be attacked with preventors or anti-inflammatories; relievers, which provide acute relief of symptoms; and controllers, which provide a sustained bronchodilator action with a mild anti-inflammatory action. It should be noted that there are some misconceptions about the treatment of chronic asthma. For instance, antihistamines do not appear to be an effective chronic asthma treatment strategy. Immunosuppressives such as methotrexate are rarely beneficial for chronic asthma, and acupuncture has a negligible effect. The basic goals of educating those with chronic asthma include an ability to understand the nature of asthma, an understanding of different types of asthma medication, an understanding of prevention strategies, knowing the correct use of inhalers, and recognizing signs of worsening asthma. Interestingly enough, chronic asthma is often misdiagnosed in the elderly. Also, older people are more susceptible to the side-effects of drugs used to treat chronic asthma. As a result, senior citizens need special prevention strategies for chronic asthma.

Treatment
GENERAL. RA is a lifelong disease process that has no known cure; the diagnosis is made based on clinical criteria and many different options exist for treatment. All of these factors magnify the importance of the patient-physician interaction and place a premium on the art rather than the science of medicine. The optimal care for patients with RA requires an effective interaction between primary care physicians and rheumatologists, and in some cases physical therapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), and orthopedic surgeons. Because of the serious nature of the disease, the rapid introduction of new treatments, and the need for expertise in monitoring these therapies, all patients with RA should be followed by a rheumatologist. The goal of therapy for RA is to put the disease in remission and to maintain this remission by continuing therapy (Table 278-5). Using currently available therapies, if RA is treated early, this is possible in 20 to 35% of patients. Unfortunately, remissions require the ongoing use of medications and even then are not always durable. Some combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, and DMARDs is necessary in almost all patients. In many, perhaps most, combinations of different DMARDs or DMARDs plus biologicals are necessary for optimal control. It is of critical importance that therapy be escalated rapidly to ensure maximal suppression of disease with minimal toxicity and expense. Additionally, all patients with RA should be educated about their disease and the therapies that will be used. In most cases, patients should have an opportunity to spend time with PT and OT to learn about range-of-motion exercises, joint protection, and assistive devices. When treating RA, four types of medical therapies are used: NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, DMARDs, and biological DMARDs. NSAIDs. NSAIDs are important for the symptomatic relief provided to RA patients; however, the play only a minor role, if any, in altering the underlying disease process. Therefore, NSAIDs should rarely, if ever, be used to treat RA without the concomitant use of DMARDs. Many clinicians waste valuable time switching from one NSAID to another before starting DMARD therapy. Much has been written about the gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs, and many of these concerns are particularly relevant to RA patients who have a significant number of risk factors that are associated with toxicities. Therefore, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective agents have been particularly popular in this group of patients. Several caveats should be kept in mind: RA patients have a significantly increased risk for cardiovascular problems, and since COX-2 drugs provide little antiplatelet activity, many of these patients will need to take low-dose aspirin therapy in addition to their COX-2 selective drug, and the effect this has on gastrointestinal toxicity is unclear. Additionally, the COX-2 drugs appear to differ little from the nonselective COX agents in terms of their effects on the kidney and on blood pressure. Both of these issues are of particular concern for RA patients because of their significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. GLUCOCORTICOIDS. Glucocorticoids have had a significant role in the treatment of RA for over half a century. Indeed, RA was chosen as the first disease to test this new therapy in 1948, partly because it was thought that RA was a disease of glucocorticoid deficiency (an issue that remains unresolved). As was the case with the first patient treated in 1948, glucocorticoid therapy can be dramatically and rapidly effective in patients with RA. Glucocorticoids are not only useful for symptomatic improvement but significantly decrease the radiographic progression of RA. 1 Unfortunately, the toxicities of long-term steroid therapy are legend. Therefore, the optimal use of these drugs requires an understanding of the principles of steroid use in RA (Table 278-6). Glucocorticoids remain among the most potent, anti-inflammatory treatments available: because of this and their rapid onset of action, they are ideally suited to help control the inflammation in RA while the much slower-acting DMARDs are starting to work. Prednisone, the most commonly used glucocorticoid, should rarely be used in doses higher than 10 mg/day to treat the articular manifestations of RA. This dose should be slowly tapered to the lowest effective dose, and the concomitant DMARD therapy should be adjusted to make this possible. Glucocorticoids should rarely, if ever, be used to treat RA without concomitant DMARD therapy. The paradigm is to shut off inflammation rapidly with glucocorticoids and then to taper them as the DMARD is kicking in (""bridge therapy""). In all patients on glucocorticoids, strong consideration should be given to the prevention of osteoporosis, and bisphosphonates have been shown to be particularly effective in this regard. Higher doses of glucocorticoids may be necessary for extra-articular manifestations, especially for vasculitis and scleritis. DMARDs. DMARDs are a group of medications that have the ability to modify or change the disabling potential of RA. In most cases, drugs included in this class have met the ""gold standard,"" which is the ability to halt or slow the radiographic progression of RA. Included in this group of medications are methotrexate, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), gold, antimalarials, leflunomide (Arava), azathioprine, penicillamine, and minocycline. It is critically important that clinicians and patients alike understand that these medications take 2 to 6 months to exert their maximal effect. Therefore, other measures such as glucocorticoid therapy may be needed to control the disease while these medications are starting to work. All of these DMARDs have been shown to be effective in treating both early and more advanced RA. The choice of which to start first depends on patient and physician concerns about toxicity and monitoring issues, as well as the activity of disease and comorbid conditions. Until additional research elucidates factors that allow us to select the best initial therapy for each patient, there are many reasonable choices for initial therapy. The critical factor is not which DMARD to start first but the fact that DMARD therapy is started early in the disease process. Methotrexate is the preferred DMARD of most rheumatologists, in part because patients have a more durable response and when monitored correctly, serious toxicities are rare. Methotrexate is dramatically effective in slowing the radiographic progression of RA and is usually given orally in doses ranging from 5 to 25 mg/week, given as a single dose. This once-a-week administration is worthy of emphasis; prior experience with daily therapy in psoriasis has taught us the importance of allowing the liver time to recover between doses. Oral absorption of methotrexate is variable; therefore, subcutaneous injections of methotrexate may be effective when oral treatment is not. Side effects of methotrexate include oral ulcers, nausea, hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and pneumonitis. With the exception of pneumonitis, these toxicities respond to dose adjustments. Monitoring of blood counts and liver blood tests (albumin and aspartate aminotransaminase or alanine aminotransferase) should be done every 4 to 8 weeks with dosage adjustments as needed. Renal function is critical for clearance of methotrexate; previously stable patients may experience severe toxicities when renal function deteriorates. Pneumonitis, although rare, is less predictable and may be fatal, particularly if the methotrexate is not stopped or is restarted. Folic acid in the dose of 1 to 4 mg/day can significantly decrease most methotrexate toxicities without apparent loss of efficacy against RA. Methotrexate in combination with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be more effective than methotrexate alone. 2 Leflunomide, a pyrimidine antagonist, is the newest DMARD approved for use in RA. It has very long half-life and therefore a loading dose of 100 mg/day for three days may be given before daily therapy of 10 to 20 mg/day is started. The most common toxicity is diarrhea, which may respond to dose reduction. Also, because of its long half-life and its teratogenic potential, women wishing to become pregnant who have previously received leflunomide, even if therapy was stopped years ago, should have blood levels drawn. If toxicity occurs or if pregnancy is being considered, leflunomide can be rapidly eliminated from the body with cholestyramine. Antimalarials, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) or chloroquine, are frequently used for the treatment of RA. They have the least toxicity of any of the DMARDs and do not require monitoring of blood tests. Yearly or twice-yearly monitoring by an ophthalmologist is recommended to detect any signs of retinal toxicity (rare). Hydroxychloroquine is the most commonly used preparation and is given orally 200 to 400 mg/day. These drugs are frequently used in combination with other DMARDs, particularly methotrexate. Sulfasalazine is the most commonly used DMARD in Europe. It is an effective treatment when given in doses of 1 to 3 g/day. Monitoring of blood counts, particularly white blood cell counts, in the first 6 months is recommended. Minocycline, 100 mg twice daily, has been shown to be an effective treatment for RA, particularly when used in early, seropositive disease. Chronic therapy (>2 years) with minocycline may lead to cutaneous hyperpigmentation. Gold, the oldest DMARD, when given intramuscularly, remains an extremely effective therapy for a small percentage of patients. It is less commonly used because of its slow onset of action, need for intramuscular administration, frequent monitoring required (complete blood count and urinalysis) and frequent toxicities. Toxicities include skin rashes, bone marrow suppression, and proteinuria. BIOLOGICAL DMARDs. Recent research has continued to elucidate the central role that cytokines, most notably TNF-α and IL-1, play in the pathophysiology of RA. This has led directly to the development and clinical use of biological agents directed against TNF-α (etanercept [Enbrel] and infliximab [Remicade]) and IL-1 (anakinra [Kineret]). Etanercept is a recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein and is administered by subcutaneous injection 25 mg twice weekly. Infliximab is a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-α that is given intravenously (3 to 10 mg/kg) every 4 to 8 weeks. Both have been shown to be highly effective against both clinical symptoms and radiographic progression of RA. 3, 4 A rapid onset of action (days to weeks) is apparent with both of these agents and is a significant advantage that these treatments have over conventional DMARDs. Current disadvantages include cost and concern about long-term toxicities, in particular, infections (especially tuberculosis) and demyelinating syndromes. Adalimumab, a newer anti-TNF agent, improves disease in patients who already are taking methotrexate. 5 Anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, is given subcutaneously 100 mg/day. It has been shown to be effective against signs and symptoms of RA as well as radiographic progression. Its onset of action is somewhat slower and less dramatic than the TNF inhibitors. Toxicities include injection site reactions and pneumonia (especially in patients with asthma). COMORBIDITY. Optimal care of patients with RA requires a recognition of the associated comorbid conditions, including an increased risk of cardiovascular death, osteoporosis, infections (especially pneumonia), and an increased risk of certain cancers. Increasingly, cardiovascular disease is being recognized as the cause of much of the excess mortality in RA. A number of factors probably contribute to this mortality, including sedentary lifestyle, glucocorticoid therapy, and treatments that increase homocysteine levels such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine. However, with the recent identification of the strong association between chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease, it is likely that this may be the most significant factor. Therapies that control RA earlier and better can be expected to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should consider RA a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and should aggressively address other cardiovascular risk factors in their rheumatoid patients. Osteoporosis is ubiquitous in patients with RA, and early therapy results in long-term dividends. Patients with RA are at an increased risk for infections, and this risk is further increased by some of our therapies. Patients should be cautioned to seek medical attention early for even minor symptoms suggestive of infection, especially if receiving anti-TNF therapy. All patients with RA should receive a pneumococcal and yearly influenza vaccinations. Finally, patients with RA have an increased risk of lymphomas. Occasionally, B-cell lymphomas may be associated with immunosuppression and regress after immunosuppression is discontinued. RA patients have significantly decreased risk (odds ratio, 0.2) of developing colon cancer. This is thought to be secondary to chronic inhibition of COX by NSAIDs in this group of patients.

What is Golimumab?
Golimumab (also known by its trade name Simponi) is a medication given for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
How does it work?
Golimumab works by binding to a substance called tumour necrosis factor (TNF). It is one of a number of anti-TNF drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. TNF is a key element in the development of inflammation. In rheumatoid arthritis, there is over-production of TNF, leading to excess inflammation affecting the joints which causes pain, swelling and ultimately joint destruction. By binding to TNF, golimumab prevents it from promoting inflammation. This leads to a reduction in symptoms and prevention of further joint damage.
What is it used for/when is it used?
Golimumab can be used if the arthritis is still active, and two or more DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, etc have not been effective in controlling the disease.
How is it administered?
It is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection once a month. Golimumab is normally used with methotrexate, but can be given on its own.
Who should not take golimumab?
Golimumab is only given to patients with active disease. This is measured by the DAS (disease activity score) which looks at symptoms, joint pain, swelling and markers of inflammation.
Golimumab should not be given if there is active infection. Your doctor may also advise you not to take golimumab if you suffer from chronic or recurrent infections, or have previously been exposed to tuberculosis.
If you or a family member suffer from multiple sclerosis (MS) your doctor may decide against prescribing golimumab (MS causes patches of inflammation in the brain or spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as visual disturbance, limb weakness and muscles spasms. The symptoms initially come and go but can eventually become permanent).
Golimumab should be avoided in patients with heart failure since it can worsen symptoms. Tell your doctor if you get new or worsening symptoms of heart failure. Symptoms of heart failure may include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet
What are the potential side effects?
As with all medication, golimumab can cause side effects. The likelihood of these side effects are similar to those of other anti-TNF therapies currently available.
The more common side effects are headache, nausea and mild swelling and redness at the site of injection.
Golimumab lowers your body’s ability to fight infection. Thus, patients who take golimumab may be more susceptible to infections and may take longer to recover from them. Mild infections are more common, whereas severe infections such as tuberculosis are much more rare. You should seek medical help if you develop any signs of infection including:
● fever, sweats or chills
● cough
● shortness of breath
● weight loss
● diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting
● burning when you pass urine, or passing more urine than normal
● fatigue
Previous research has shown there is a slightly higher incidence of a type of cancer known as lymphoma in patient with rheumatoid arthritis compared to that in the general population. However, treatment with golimumab has not been shown to increase the risk of cancer. This is undergoing further research.
What tests do I need before starting golimumab?
Your doctor will take an extensive past medical and drug history including information about:
● Heart failure
● Chronic infections
● Previous exposure to tuberculosis either in yourself or close family members
● Multiple Sclerosis
● Any previous or active cancer
Since golimumab can increase the risk of reactivation of certain chronic infections, your doctor will test you for tuberculosis and hepatitis B prior to starting treatment. This will include blood tests and a chest X-ray.
When should I stop Golimumab?
Stop golimumab immediately if you develop an allergic reaction i.e. rash, hives, swollen lips or a swollen tongue.
You should stop golimumab if you develop an infection. It can be re-started once the infection has cleared.
Seek medical attention immediately if you are in contact with or develop chickenpox or shingles.
Golimumab should also be witheld before and during surgery. You will need to check with your rheumatology consultant when to stop and restart the drug
How is the treatment monitored?
Your doctor will monitor if golimumab is effective by measuring your DAS. Although it may take up to three months (around 3-4 doses) before golimumab has an effect it may be faster than this.
Your doctor will also check you blood counts and liver tests on a regular basis.
How can I avoid infection?
● Avoid food such as un-pasteurised milk, products containing raw or undercooked eggs or meat (such as mayonnaise or pate), mould-ripened cheese such as Brie or Camembert, blue cheese, goats or feta cheese.
● Avoid taking “live” vaccinations - your family doctor can advise you about this.
● Avoid contact with anyone suffering from chickenpox or shingles.
● Wash raw fruit and vegetables before consumption.
● Ensure chilled/ready prepared meals are piping hot before serving.
Your doctor may advise the Pneumovax vaccine, and you should have the flu vaccine every year.
Can I take golimumab during pregnancy?
Golimumab is not licensed for pregnant women or those that are breast-feeding.
It is unknown what effect golimumab will have on your baby. Thus it is advisable to use contraception whilst on golimumab, and to stop it at least 5 months prior to trying for a baby. You should also avoid golimumab if you are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant whilst taking golimumab, contact your doctor immediately.
What about alcohol?
You can drink alcohol with golimumab. However this can cause liver dysfunction, particularly if taken together with methotrexate. Thus if you are drinking alcohol, only take in moderation.
Where can I get further information?
You can get more information from your doctor or rheumatology specialist nurse.

Lap-Band Failures: Conversion To Gastric Bypass And Their Preliminary
Outcomes
The LAP-BAND is designed to be an adjustable laparoscopically placed
gastric restriction device for the treatment of severe obesity. The purpose
of this study was to assess the outcome in patients who had failed to
effectively lose weight with this device and were converted to a gastric
bypass.
Method
A retrospective chart review was performed of all LAP-BANDS placed in
patients at our institution from March 1996 to June 1998.
Results
36 LAP-BANDS were placed. To date, 18 of 36 (50%) have been removed.
Fourteen of 18 were simultaneously converted to a gastric bypass. Indications
for conversion included: failed weight loss (5), failed weight loss with
esophageal dilatation (5), failed weight loss with leaking band (2), and
symptomatic esophageal dilatation (1). Median time to conversion after
LAP-BAND placement was 38.2 months. Median follow-up after conversion
to gastric bypass was 8.3 months. Nineteen percent excess weight loss
occurred after LAP-BAND placement. Forty-three percent excess weight loss
occurred after conversion to gastric bypass.
Conclusion
In our experience, the LAP-BAND is associated with a high frequency of
inadequate weight loss. Conversion to gastric bypass in this subset of
patients is technically challenging but results in superior weight loss
in a shorter time period.

Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Musculoskeletal Complaints
Over 18 months, researchers studied the frequency and prevalence of musculoskeletal
(MSK) complaints in obese patients before and after undergoing gastric
bypass surgery. The researchers concluded that the complaints, which involved
joint and tendon pain, decreased significantly following surgery and initial
weight loss, even in non-weight bearing areas of the body.
Study Method
The comprehensive review of MSK symptoms (neck, shoulder, spine, hip,
knee, foot pain, fibromyalgia syndrome, etc.) before and after weight
loss studied 54 patients recruited from University Hospitals of Cleveland's
Bariatric Surgery Program, according to Michele Hooper, MD, the study's
principal investigator and co-director of the Arthritis Translational
Research Program at University Hospitals of Cleveland.
Patients
Of the 54 patients who were studied, there were 52 women and two men
ranging in age from 35-53 years. For the female participants, the mean
weight before surgery was 292 pounds. Many patients suffered from the
following comorbid conditions before surgery: hypertension, sleep apnea,
type 2 diabetes, asthma, bladder incontinence and gastroesophageal reflux
disease.
Results
Dr. Hooper's findings, which will be presented in San Antonio at the
American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting on October 21, 2004,
demonstrated that there was decrease of 52% in the number of sites of
musculoskeletal complaints and a 92% reduction in fibromyalgia syndrome
pain (widespread pain and tenderness in muscles and soft tissue) between
6-12 months after surgery. There was significant improvement of function
and quality life as well.
Musculoskeletal Indices Used
Using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC),
a leading outcome measure of osteoarthritis-related disabilities in the
hip and knee; as well as the London Fibromyalgia Epidemiology Study Screening
(LFESSQ), an index that test pain and fatigue criteria, Dr. Hooper and
colleagues found that there was a dramatic resolution of fibromyalgia
pain after surgery, which may be due to a decrease in the above stated
comorbid syndromes and an increase in physical activity. As weight loss
continues, these benefits may improve further.
Conclusion
""The study clearly showed the benefit of weight loss in terms of
pain, function and quality of life. We are now trying to understand why
certain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis are so much more common
than hip or ankle arthritis in people who are overweight,"" says Dr.
Hooper.

Can The Edmonton Obesity Staging System Better Guide Indications for Bariatric Surgery?
Current recommendations for bariatric surgery are largely based on BMI levels, although the presence of comorbidities has been used to justify surgical interventions at lower BMIs.
While there is little doubt that current data suggest that bariatric surgery can alleviate and, in some cases, reverse the impact of excess weight on a wide range of comorbidities and improve quality of life, these benefits are less clear for individuals, who do not have these problems to begin with.
Indeed, we have previously noted that a significant number of patients currently undergoing bariatric surgery may have rather limited overall risk and that data on putative health benefits in terms of disease prevention remain rather sparse.
In out recent analysis of the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) in the NHANES population, we therefore specifically examined the ability of EOSS to predict mortality risk in individuals, who meet current BMI, age, and comormiditiy criteria in surgical guidelines and expert consensus statements.
In this subgroup of participants, despite adjustment for metabolic syndrome or hypertriglyceridemic waistline, EOSS substantially outperformed BMI criteria.
In fact, while individuals with Class III obesity (after adjustment for metabolic syndrome or waist line) had virtually no increased mortality risk compared to Class II obese individuals (HR 0.9), individuals with EOSS 2 or 3 had a four to twelve-fold greater hazard ratio, respectively, compared to individuals with EOSS 0/1.
In light of these data, we discuss the potential role of EOSS in determining indications for bariatric surgery as follows:
“Currently, most patients are selected for surgery on the basis of BMI thresholds alone and have few obesity related comorbidities. The practice of selecting patients using BMI alone has been criticized as inaccurate and arbitrary and may result in the selection of patients who are least likely to benefit from weight reduction.9 Prioritizing patients with higher Edmonton obesity staging system scores — and thus greater comorbidity and risk of death — may help maximize the benefits of surgery.”
Obviously, this view may not be shared by some bariatric surgeons, who often highlight the ‘preventive’ nature of their intervention, their argument being that it may be better to operate early to preempt and hopefully prevent the development of relevant comorbidities.
Unfortunately, this argument does not wash.
Firstly, as shown in our studies, there are a substantial number of patients even with Class III obesity, who may have minimal mortality risk over the rather lengthy observation periods of the NHANES III and ACLS cohorts (almost 20 years); notably this observation period is substantially longer than all current bariatric surgical studies (perhaps with the exception of the Swedish Obesity Study).
Secondly, little is known about the ‘natural history’ of obesity in that we currently do not have good predictors of who will indeed progress to higher EOSS stages and who will remain weight stable and ‘healthy’. Thus the notion of ‘prevention’ will need to be looked at in prospective studies before assuming that such ‘preventive’ surgery is in fact both cost-effective and offers a reasonable risk/benefit ratio.
Thirdly, the need to preempt many of the obesity related comorbidities may be less ‘urgent’ than some surgeons suggest. This is because virtually all of the obesity related comorbidities are largely ‘reversible’, especially in patients defined as EOSS 2 (no clinically relevant target organ damage). Thus, there is ample time to still operate and expect reasonable outcomes when patients actually progress to EOSS 2.
The notion of ‘preventive’ surgery is therefore, perhaps not as convincing, as some surgeons may wish us to believe.
It is also very likely that a formal health economic analysis based on EOSS criteria will likely strongly support the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for EOSS 2/3 patients, with minimal (if any) cost-effectiveness (even in the long-term) in EOSS 0/1 individuals.
Thus, we strongly feel, that EOSS may well serve as a tool in guiding indications for bariatric surgery and will likely attract considerable attention from payers. At least in a publicly funded health care system, it may be prudent to argue that patients with EOSS 2/3 should likely be prioritized to make best use of limited access and resources.
I certainly look forward to what I am sure will be a most lively debate, especially as I head out to present our findings at the forthcoming International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) meeting in Hamburg early next month.

One Response to “Can The Edmonton Obesity Staging System Better Guide Indications for Bariatric Surgery?”
Bill Graber says:
August 21st, 2011 at 3:14 pm
Having been working with obese people for many years now, I think that I see very few level 0-1 patients. Their diabetes may not be diagnosed, but the HgA1c may be at 6.6, their liver function tests may not be elvated, but the liver is clearly fatty when they get their gall bladder ultrasounds, and they may say their knees don’t hurt but they avoid physical activity because their joints will hurt and be damaged, they may say they are not short of breath but they are looked at as an anchor during family trips to Disney Land.
As for the natural history of obesity, most of the people I work with have a closet full of their clothes as a diary stating at size 6, then size 10, then size 16, then size 25 etc….
And I think we can all agree that a better measure than BMI is needed, and agree that a functional measure is better

Is there a chance the REALIZE Band will be recalled because of complication rate?
by Ann
(Dalton, Georgia)
I had the Realize band which has a higher rate of irritating the stomach - when mine is adjusted enough to work it irritates until it swells my esophagus shut. I have had to have an emergency adjustment 3 different times to get relief from horrible spasms and pain. I can't swallow at all when this happens - not even my saliva. This is a more common problem with this band I'm told - will there ever be a recall on it since it is obviously defective?I have regained my weight and wish that I had not gone through this terrible two year ordeal with this band.

Diet After Each Lap Band Fill
by: Mindy
I have kind of the same issues you have, however I do not have the Realize band. I found out I am more sensitive to fills than most people.I would suggest a few things:Get smaller fills. By that I mean MUCH Smaller fills. If you usually get a 1cc fill, get HALF OF HALF a cc fill! You might think I am crazy but this will be all you may need. If it means going in sooner for another fill, then that is better than throwing up and risking a lap band slip.The other thing I recommend is what my doc does to all his patients. At first I thought he was nuts, but it makes sense to me now.After every fill, my post-fill diet is: 3 days clear liquids, 3 days liquids, 3 days mushies, 3 days semi-solids. His reasoning? After each time you get a fill, your stomach is being manipulated; it's an invasive procedure. It causes swelling (obviously, since you and I both have problems). This post-fill diet allows your stomach to heal and the fill to kick in! The other thing I would suggest is when you eat eat a small amount, wait 20 minutes then eat some more if you feel ok. My doctor suggested this to me and I end up eating 5 or 6 small meals a day rather than 3 ""larger"" meals. Hope that helps!

Comfort Aire Dehumidifiers
Dehumidifiers are essential for anyone who wants to prevent mold spores from growing in their home or basement. If you keep the humidity low, dust mites cannot survive. Some Comfort Aire dehumidifiers have a low temperature feature, especially useful for moisture removal in mildew, odor filled basements. Comfort Aire dehumidifiers just keep going and going, sucking out water from your air at a fast clip while being energy misers. Put on an auxiliary pump, so you can just set and forget. These smart dehumidifiers even turn themselves back on to the preset levels after a power outage!
If you want more options, see our complete selection of dehumidifiers.

Why we Like Comfort Aire Dehumidifiers
We recommend the BHD-501-G Comfort Aire dehumidifiers, for people who need reliable, cost effective, humidity control in areas up to 1000 sq. ft., and operation down to 41°F for basement dehumidification. These dehumidifiers also offer accurate touchpad controls with digital humidity display - an appreciated extra not always found on dehumidifiers in this lower price range. Furthermore, the auto restart feature guarantees your settings will be saved and the unit will start back up after any power outage. To insure your purchase arrives in excellent condition we have added foam support inserts and an outer box to the standard packaging from the manufacturer.
Pluses of Comfortaire Dehumidifiers
1. Low temperature operation: Comfort Aire dehumidifiers operate down to 41°F, great convenience for basements.
2. Auto restart useful through power outages: Particularly useful for those away from home often or vacation homes, because these dehumidifiers will automatically re-start themselves at the original settings once the power is restored.
3. Energy efficient: The Comfort Aire dehumidifiers received an Energy Star rating, and it is always a big plus to save on electricity.
4. Set and forget humidity control with digital display: The digitally adjustable humidistat allows the operator to set the humidity level to a desired setting at 5% increments from 35% to 85% relative humidity. The intuitive controls are clearly readable on the top of the dehumidifier, and digital readouts give the room humidity and in addition the humidity level at which the adjustable humidistat has been set. The internal humidistat maintains humidity level in a room automatically to desired setting by cycling the dehumidifier on and off as needed.
5. Easy drainage options:
1. Water bucket with auto-shut off: uses a lever system to shut the machine off when the bucket is filled rather than the ""float on a wire"" system that tends to jam occasionally in some other dehumidifiers. When the bucket has filled, the unit will shut off automatically and let you know by a warning light on the top.
2. Automatic, easy to use gravity drain or pump: For those who want to constantly drain the water by use of gravity or a pump, Comfort Aire dehumidifiers are ideal because the drain connection does not attach to a hole in the bottom of the bucket, but has a drain connection above the bucket. Included is a 1 foot plastic tube that gets pushed onto this drain connection, then you can run the tube out the back corner of the cabinet, and attach a hose to the threaded end of the tube, and never worry about emptying the bucket.
6. Easy access, large front loading bucket: water removal buckets hold 21 pints, and are more convenient in front; easy grip handle is on bucket for emptying water, and slides in and out of dehumidifier easily.
7. Portable: Comfort Aire dehumidifiers roll easily on 4 casters, and can be lifted using the sturdy built-in hand grips.
8. Fast drying fan speeds: Both fan speeds (high and low) produce a higher volume of air than most other dehumidifiers and so will dry rooms more quickly.
Minuses:
1. Included continuous drainage tube can be awkward to insert into the continuous drainage hole.
2. Comfort Aire dehumidifiers need at least 12"" of space all around the unit for the manufacturer's specified operation.

How it Works:
The Free Star range of units are high capacity dehumidifiers, made to operate at high efficiencies by removing moisture from the air through the refrigeration process. The fan draws the moist air through the cold evaporator coil, which cools the air below its dew point. Moisture forms on the evaporator coil and is collected in the condensate tray, which is equipped with an internal condensate pump for easy removal of collected moisture. The cooled air then passes through the hot condenser coil where it is reheated using the same energy removed during the cooling phase, plus the additional heat generated by the compressor. The air is, therefore, discharged from the dehumidifier at a slightly higher temperature with a lower absolute humidity than that which entered. Continuous circulation of air through the dehumidifier gradually reduces the relative humidity within the area. Because the Free Star range of units are equipped with an internal humidistat, they automatically switch on and off to save energy and expense by maintaining the desired level of humidity with an intermittent operation.

What is Asthma?
Asthma is a disease of the lungs that causes the airways narrow and tighten, often in response to a trigger such as exposure to an allergen, exercise, or
emotional stress. As with allergies, an over-sensitive immune response leads asthma symptoms, with the main symptom being difficulty breathing. All asthma
sufferers have chronic inflammation and excessive airway sensitivity to various triggers. The prevalence of asthma in our society is rapidly
increasing. Asthma affects up to one in four urban children.
Asthma is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) since it obstructs the airways. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are other forms
of COPD. There is no cure for asthma, but it can be controlled with proper treatment including medication and avoidance of triggers.
What Causes Asthma?
Scientists do not know exactly what causes asthma. Most likely, several factors contribute the development of the disease. Some people have a genetic
predisposition to developing asthma. If one parent has asthma, each child has a 1 in 3 chance of developing asthma. If both parents have asthma, chances
rise to 7 in 10. Researchers are still looking for the genes involved. People who have hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema are also at higher risk for
developing asthma.
The environment plays a role in the development of asthma, too. Asthma attacks are reactions to triggers like environmental irritants or allergens. Asthma
prevalence is increasing in the United States and many other parts of the world, perhaps because people are spending more time indoors, breathing in more
indoor allergens. The hygiene hypothesis (applicable to the rise in prevalence of both allergies and asthma) posits that these diseases are increasing
because people in modern societies grow up with less exposure to infectious agents, which makes their immune systems more sensitive to normally harmless
substances. Furthermore, modern air is much more polluted than the air our ancestors breathed. Some evidence also suggests a link between asthma
and obesity.
Asthma Triggers
Common asthma triggers include:
tobacco or wood smoke
polluted air
allergens like mold, dust, & animal dander
respiratory infections
cold weather
emotional stress
physical exercise
stomach acid reflux (GERD)
sulfites (additives in some foods and wines)
menstruation (in some, not all, women)
Asthma Prevalence
Asthma affects more than 20 million adults in the United States. Over 9 million U.S. children have been diagnosed with asthma, and it's the most prevalent
chronic condition among children. The prevalence of asthma increased 75% from 1980-1994. Asthma prevalence is 39% higher in African Americans. Asthma is a
major cause of missed work and school days.
Asthma Symptoms
Asthma symptoms include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, and difficulty speaking.
Asthma Attacks
An asthma attack is much like an allergic reaction, and so asthma is sometimes referred to as reactive airway disease. When immune cells mistake an asthma trigger for an invader, a series of reactions produce the
mucus and bronchospasms characteristic of an asthma attack. Bronchioles (airways) swell, and the muscles tighten, making it harder to breathe.
Asthma Treatment
You should not take cough medicine to treat asthma; it will not help and may cause side effects. Do not take non-prescription medicines or natural or
herbal remedies without first consulting your physician; some of these remedies may interfere with your medicines. Take your medication exactly as
directed. If your medication is not working, do not take more than you have been prescribed, as overuse can be dangerous.
Successful asthma treatment revolves around taking asthma medication as directed and avoiding environmental asthma triggers.
Asthma Medications
Some asthma medications are for long-term relief, while others are for quick relief.
Long-term asthma medications are normally taken every day and include corticosteroids (usually inhaled) to reduce swelling and mucus
production. Corticosteroids are the most effective medicine for the treatment of asthma. However, inhaled corticosteroids may affect the growth of some
children and increase the risk of bruising.
Please note: When using corticosteroids in a metered dose inhaler, it is very important to use a spacer, or
holding chamber, and gargle with water afterward. Spit out the water to
reduce the amount of the drug that's accidentally swallowed. If you don't use a holding chamber, you increase the risk of side effects like mouth and
throat irritation and oral thrush (oral yeast infection). Examples of inhaled corticosteroids include Flovent, Pulmicort, Azmacort, Aerobid, and
Qvar. Advair is an inhaler that combines a corticosteroid with a long-acting beta-agonist.
Long-acting beta-agonists are bronchodilators that help relax the muscles of the airways. In 2005, the FDA issued a public health advisory for Advair
Diskus, Foradil Aerolizer, and Serevent Diskus, warning that these medications may increase the risk of severe asthma episodes and possibly death from an
asthma attack. Long-acting beta-agonists should never be used for quick relief.
Leukotriene modifiers come in tablet form and serve as an alternative or supplement to corticosteroids. They are anti-inflammatory in nature, and
examples include Singulair, Accolate, and Zyflo.
Theophylline, another bronchodilator, helps prevent nighttime symptoms and may cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, acid
reflux, confusion, irregular heartbeat, and nervousness. Theophylline prescriptions are less common now than in the past.
Nedocromil and cromolyn have anti-inflammatory effects and may be used to treat mild asthma. Cromolyn is available for use in a nebulizer and therefore
often used in treating young children.
Quick relief asthma medications, also known as rescue medications, provide relief of asthma attack symptoms and include short-acting
beta-agonists, which work as bronchodilators and relax the muslces around the bronchial tubes (airways). Albuterol is the most common short-acting
beta-agonist and is the active ingredient in Airet, Proventil, and Ventolin. Levalbuterol is a new, purer form of albuterol available as Xopenex. Other
short-acting beta-agonists include Tornalate, Maxair, and Brethaire.
Ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic and also a bronchodilator, is used by people who cannot tolerate short-acting beta-agonists; it's also used
among those whose asthma is triggered by beta-blocker heart medication. Atrovent is an example of ipratropium bromide.
Systemic steroids (oral or intravenous) take longer to act but help prevent additional attacks. Examples include prednisone as Deltasone and
Orasone, Prelone, Pediapred, and Medrol. Long-term use of systemic corticosteroids could cause serious side effects like cataracts, osteoporosis, muscle
weakness, decreased immune function, and high blood pressure.
Asthma medications are either taken orally or inhaled using a metered dose inhaler (MDI), dry powder inhaler (DPI), or nebulizer.
Xolair, a new medication for allergy-induced asthma, is given by injection under the skin every two to four weeks. Xolair is an anti-IgE monoclonal
antibody that blocks the antibodies which lead to inflammation. Xolair risks include the possibility of a severe reaction soon after getting the shot,
blood-clotting problems, and a possible link to cancer.
Nebulizers for Asthma Medications
Nebulizers are devices that administer medication in the form of a liquid mist
into the airways. Nebulizers pump oxygen through liquid medicine, turning it into a vapor which can be inhaled. As with inhalers, if nebulizers are used
to administer an inhaled corticosteroid, you should rinse out your mouth with water to avoid oral thrush.
One type of nebulizer is the the small, lightweight
PARI TREK Nebulizer. Some nebulizers are made
specially for children, like the quiet and easy-to-use MedQuip Pediatric
Nebulizer. The Bubbles Fish Mask is also made specially for
children to use with nebulizers to minimize aerosol loss and make treatment time more fun.
Holding Chambers or Spacers for Asthma Medications
As stated above, you should always use a
holding chamber or spacer for inhaled
corticosteroids. Holding chambers are tubes that increase the effectiveness of inhalers by slowing down the delivery of the medication. Using a spacer also
reduces the risk of side effects from corticosteroid residue in the mouth. Young children who don't understand the timing of inhalers normally use holding
chambers.
Asthma MDI Inhaler Changes
MDIs traditionally used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to propel drugs like albuterol into the lungs. However, CFCs harm the ozone layer. After
December 31, 2008, you will be required to use a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhaler instead of a CFC inhaler. HFA inhalers have been available since 1996, and
they may feel or taste a bit different than CFC inhalers.
Peak Flow Monitoring
Peak flow meters help you detect subtle increases in airway obstruction. A low reading
may be a sign of an oncoming asthma attack or that control medications need to be changed. Discuss peak flow monitoring in more detail with your doctor, and
don't forget to keep you peak flow meter clean using hot water and soap.
Asthma Trigger Avoidance - Asthma Prevention
The best way to prevent an asthma attack is to identify all of your triggers and avoid them. See our allergy solution guides and learn how to avoid the
following common asthma triggers: dust
mites, mold, pet dander,
and pollen.
Allergy bedding is the most effective first line of defense against
allergens. Air purifiers eliminate allergens as well as airborne toxins like cigarette smoke
and chemical fumes. Window, furnace, & vent filters also trap allergens in the air, as
do allergy relief masks. Cold weather masks help
prevent asthma attacks triggered by cold weather. Dehumidifiers curb mold and
dust mite growth, and HEPA vacuum cleaners pick up allergens in carpet and
upholstery.
Childhood Asthma
Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases among children and affects up to one in four urban children. Asthma is the most common cause of missed
school due to chronic disease. Approximately 80% of childhood asthma sufferers develop symptoms before the age of five. If you think your child may have
asthma, look for coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, and see your doctor for a diagnosis. All children with asthma should have
asthma management plans and know what to do in case of an emergency.
""Planning is the key to overcoming panic,"" says James Li, M.D., an asthma and allergy specialist at the Mayo Clinic. ""A written plan can give you and your
child the confidence to treat asthma signs and symptoms promptly.""
A recent asthma study showed that only about 20 percent of children with asthma are
receiving optimal care, meaning that 80 percent could be receiving better care with more consistent use of medication, less exposure to environmental
triggers, and more education about asthma.
See Disarming Asthma - A Mother's Perspective for more information about childhood asthma.
Asthma Emergency
You should go to a hospital if you have an asthma attack with severe shortness of breath. To learn more about what to do during an asthma
emergency, see Are You Prepared for an Asthma Emergency? for expert advice from a
certified paramedic.

Asthma/Allergies in North Carolina ?
Question:I am a moderate allergy-induced asthma sufferer who is planning on
moving to the Raleigh/Durham area early next year. Can anyone provide
any insight or links to information regarding the affects of Carolina
weather (specifically tree pollens and humidity) on asthmatics ? Any
help would be greatly appreciated !
Answer:I live in Columbia, South Carolina and my asthma is definitely better in the
fall and winter. I find it much harder to breathe on our hot, humid summer
days. If you find that humidity is a bother, you may want to check into
getting a good dehumidifier.
It depends. Are you allergic to the things that are in the air in
that area? That's a good question. It's really time for me to have another
evaluation and see what bothers me the most. After I know this, I can
compare it with what is prevelant in North Carolina. How can I find out
the kinds of allergens that are in the air in N.C. ?
Try:

list that included plants indigenous to the area. I'm sure you could get
your hands on one.

» Environmental Control of Allergens
A Beginner's Guide to Environmental Control of Allergens
Three basic treatment options exist for allergy sufferers:
Allergy Medication
Immunotherapy (Allergy Shots)
Environmental Control
What Is Environmental Control?
Environmental control requires a bit of work on your part - it's not quite as easy as swallowing a pill or getting a shot - but it is the
most effective treatment for allergies. If you can control your environment and avoid your allergens, then you will not experience
allergy symptoms. It's that simple!
Environmental control may involve frequent vacuuming with a HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner, encasing your mattress and pillows with special
allergy relief bedding, running an air purifier, wearing a mask, or placing a dehumidifier in your basement. Your environmental control plan
depends on the specific allergens to which you are allergic.
What Causes Allergy Symptoms?
Allergy symptoms appear after a sensitive individual is exposed to allergens. The most common allergens are proteins from plants and
animals (although some people may be allergic to certain chemicals). Once an allergen makes its way inside the body, it sets off a
chemical chain reaction within the immune system of sensitive individuals. This chain reaction, which includes the release of histamine
and other inflammatory chemicals, leads to allergy symptoms - sneezing, watery eyes, congestion, etc.
How Do I Discover My Specific Allergens?
Before you can formulate an environmental control plan, you must know the substances that cause your allergy symptoms.
You should visit an allergist or ENT physician for allergy testing. In the most common method of allergy testing, an allergy
technician pricks the skin with a tiny needle to insert a small amount of the allergen. If the patient is allergic, then the site
of the skin prick will become red and swollen.
As another option that's more cost-effective and convenient, you can use MyAllergy Test in your own home. This easy-to-use
kit allows you to collect a sample of blood (using a finger stick lancet) and send it to a lab for allergy testing. MyAllergy Test shows if you're allergic to timothy grass, bermuda grass, mountain cedar, short ragweed, mold, milk, egg whites, wheat, cat dander, and dust mites. If you want more extensive testing, you should make an appointment with an allergist.
Once you know your specific allergens, then you can start implementing environmental controls to help you avoid exposure to your allergens.
Dust Mite Allergy
Like villains
in a microscopic sci-fi movie, dust mites are everywhere. They can live inside automobiles,
deep within carpet fibers, and on furniture. Since dust mites feed on dead human skin, they tend to hang out where the shed skin collects: in the fibers of
your bedding, mattress, and pillows. That's why it's vitally important to encase your bed with allergy relief bedding, also known as
dust mite encasings. These encasings will keep dust mites from invading your bed.
See the Allergy Bedding Buying Guide to learn more.
You should also vacuum frequently with a HEPA vacuum cleaner. Vacuuming alone
will not suck up all the dust mites, but it will take away their food. To kill dust mites in carpet, use
anti-allergenic carpet powders and sprays.
We also recommend using anti-allergenic laundry detergents and additives
to kill dust mites and denature allergens in your laundry, especially if you normally wash your laundry in cold water. (Water must be very hot
in order to kill dust mites, but you can kill them in a cold water wash by using
de-mite laundry additive or
Allergen Wash.)
If you have a dust mite allergy, you should monitor your relative humidity. Dust mites like warm, humid environments, and they cannot thrive if you keep
the relative humidity below 50 percent. Monitor your humidity with a humidity gauge.
If necessary, you can lower the humidity in your home with a dehumidifier.
See the Dehumidifier Buying Guide to learn more.
Finally, although an air purifier won't eliminate the
actual dust mites, it will eliminate excess dust in your home. To reduce dust mite populations, it's important to keep your home
free of dust and clutter. If you can, replace carpet with hardwood floors and low-pile area rugs.
Stuffed animals also harbor dust mites. You can kill dust mites on small items like stuffed animals by placing them out in the sun for
several hours or by putting them in the freezer over night. Or, you can buy washable toys like Gund Stuffed Animals.
Mold Allergy
As with dust
mites, it's impossible to get rid of every single mold spore in your home. They're everywhere! However, using environmental control measures,
you can greatly reduce the number of mold spores in your home and thereby reduce the frequency and severity of your allergy symptoms.
Like dust mites, mold requires a warm, humid environment for growth.
Monitor the humidity in your home with a humidity gauge, and
keep the humidity below 50 percent using a dehumidifier.
For protection while you're sleeping, Allergy Armor allergy relief bedding
features a special antimicrobial finish that prevents mold growth.
Use M-1 Sure Cote Mold & Mildew Resistant Sealant to clean up mold around your home and prevent future growth. AllerMold and
Vital Oxide are two additional household cleaners that are
effective against mold but safe for your family and the environment.
Be careful when cleaning mold! If the growth is significant, you'll want to wear a mask,
along with gloves and goggles.
HEPA air purifiers and HEPA vacuum cleaners also capture mold spores and remove them from
your environment. For more information, see the Vacuum Cleaner Buying Guide
and the Air Purifier Buying Guide.
Pet Dander Allergy
We've
already discussed several products that will help you avoid pet dander in your home; these products include allergy relief bedding,
air purifiers, and HEPA vacuum cleaners. Allergy Armor Ultra bedding,
for instance, blocks animal dander from your bed. Other products specially made for pet allergies include the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum and the
Austin Air Pet Machine air purifier.
If you own a pet, we also offer items to help you keep your pet's dander to a minimum, including the
Dyson Groom and
Ecology Works Pet Allergy Shampoo. See all
Pet Allergy products for more suggestions.
Of course, if you're severely allergic to a specific animal, the best advice is to stay away from that animal. If you cannot avoid spending time
with an allergenic animal, try avoid touching your face, and wash your hands (or better yet, shower) as soon as possible. And keep all pets out of your bedroom!
Pollen Allergy
The
main problem with pollen allergy is that you can't go outside and vacuum up all the pollen, nor can you stick an air purifier in your backyard
and expect it to have any affect on the pollen level. When dealing with a pollen allergy, it's best to wear a
mask outdoors. Watch your local pollen count and try to stay inside when the
pollen counts are high. Once you get inside, shower as soon as possible.
Indoors, you can use HEPA vacuums and air purifiers to capture pollen grains. Be aware that pollen will find its way inside your home any
time a door opens or window opens. If you want to get some fresh air without the pollen, put a
Safeguard Window Filter on your window.
Sinus and nasal irrigation products also work well for pollen allergy sufferers because the saline washes away pollen grains in the nasal
passages. The SinuPulse Elite is the world's most advanced nasal irrigation
system, but a simple neti pot works well, too. See our
Seasonal Allergy Solution Guide for more information about pollen allergy.

Here are some tips for understanding the air in your house and the air-quality appliances that can alter it.
Air filters
Purpose: Air-filtration systems pull most mold, pollen, dust mites, and other particulates out of household air.
The best systems use HEPA (high-efficiency particulate absorption) filters that have multiple pleats that trap tiny particles. Such a filter can be installed in the duct adjacent to the furnace fan. They also are available as portable room units.
Another kind of unit, the electronic cleaner, is especially good at sweeping mold and pollen particles from the air by catching them on an electrically charged plate.
The type of air cleaner known as an ionizer produces electrically charged ions that bond to particles in the air and causes them to cling to walls, ceilings, and drapes.
Filter systems improve air quality by removing pollutants. HEPA systems can be up to 99.9 percent efficient in removing floating particles from the air. Compare this with regular furnace filters, which are only 10 percent efficient in removing lint from the air. For a filtration system to be fully effective, it needs to run 24 hours a day.
Health benefits: A good air-filtration system can make a difference for people with severe allergies or asthma, but it's not a necessity for the average person. Keep in mind that studies have not proved that any filters dramatically reduce allergy or asthma symptoms. The best possible benefit may come from HEPA filters. So before you invest a lot of money, make sure you take other steps first. In general, families with allergy problems should first look for and eliminate or contain the source of the problem: pets, rugs, dust mites, and moldy areas in the home are the first suspects.
Disadvantages: Air-filtration systems need to be meticulously maintained. Changing the filters according to the manufacturers' instructions is critical to the success of the system. Also, these systems are no substitute for good indoor hygiene. If you have a cat, dog, or old rugs, your house is dusty, or you leave your windows open, the filtration system cannot do its work well.
Some systems with smaller motors are noisy, especially for the bedroom. They don't turn the air over as quickly and as efficiently as larger units.
In the case of ionizers, the particulates that were sent clinging to your walls, ceilings, and drapes fall off in a few days, back into your breathing environment.
Dehumidifiers
Purpose: Dehumidifiers remove moisture from the air. This curbs the growth of mold and dust mites. They are particularly useful in parts of the house where humidity collects, such as damp basements.
Dehumidifiers draw air over cold coils, condensing out its moisture, before passing the air over warm coils and back into the room. (Air conditioners also take a certain amount of moisture out of the air, but dehumidifiers do so much more efficiently.) The condensed water drips into a container in the unit that has to be emptied. The water can be routed directly to a drain by means of a hose.
Home dehumidifiers remove between 10 and 50 pints of water from the air each day, depending on the relative humidity. The capacity of a unit is measured by the number of pints it can remove in a 24-hour period at 60 percent relative humidity and at 80 degrees.
Harmful dust mites, those microscopic organisms that particularly aggravate allergy and asthma sufferers, thrive in high humidity. They live in your bedclothes, your drapes, your rugs, and the air in your home. Removing excessive moisture from indoor air helps control these pests. Dehumidifiers also can help limit mold and bacterial growth.
Health benefits: Dehumidifiers are critical for households in humid climates with very old people or very young children, or for families with a history of allergies or asthma. In their first two years of life, children spend a lot of time on the floor or rug. If you have a 10-year-old rug, it likely has a host of dust mites that thrive in the high humidity. And the more you are exposed to something to which you have a genetic tendency to be allergic, the more likely you are to become allergic to it, whether it's mold, bacteria, or dust mites.
