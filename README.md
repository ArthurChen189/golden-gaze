## Data

This pipeline was evaluated on the [TREC Health Misinformation Track](https://trec-health-misinfo.github.io/).
The topics and qrels used in our paper are hosted on the [TREC](https://trec.nist.gov/) website.
We also used two web collections: [ClueWeb12-B13](https://lemurproject.org/clueweb12/) and en.noclean version of [C4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4).
`data/WH_topics.csv` contains 90 topics (45 helpful topics and 45 topics) sampled from the `external_data/Truth.txt` originated from Ryen W White and Ahmed Hassan, where overlapping topics with 2019 or 2021 topics were removed. 

Download those file listed below and put them in the folder `data/raw_data/`.

1. 2019 topics `2019topics.xml`: https://trec.nist.gov/data/misinfo/2019topics.xml
2. 2019 topics efficacy labels `2019topics_efficacy.txt`: https://trec.nist.gov/data/misinfo/2019topics_efficacy.txt

2. 2021 qrels: https://trec.nist.gov/data/misinfo2021.html

## Environment
We use Python 3.8.10 with the following main packages.
Note that retrieving documents also requires Java environment.
```
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
nltk==3.5
pyserini==0.13.0
pytorch-lightning==1.5.8
scikit-learn==0.24.2
torch==1.9.0
transformers==4.6.1
```


## Experiment
In this section, we provide a step-by-step guidance to reproduce the results reported in our paper.
We have provided all code in this repository.
Meanwhile, we have also provided intermediate outputs after each stage.
In other words, you can quickly experiment with any stage without the need to run previous stages to get the input data to that stage.

### Stage 0: Data Preparation

Code for this stage is kept under `utils/`.

To train the Stance Detection Model, we need to use the effectiveness judgments in 2019 qrels and the stance judgments in 2021 qrels.
Specifically, we use 2019 qrels for training and 2021 qrels for evaluation.
However, those two qrels files do not contain the document content.
So we need to retrieve those documents in the qrels from the ClueWeb12-B13 index and the C4 index respectively.
Additionally, since the 2019 qrels training data is heavily imbalanced, we also need to sample an equal number of supportive (effective) and dissuasive (ineffective) document for training the Stance Detection Model.

Execute the following commands to retrieve documents judged in the 2019 qrels and the 2021 qrels respectively.

```shell
python qrels_document_retrieval.py -q 2019qrels -i [path to the index of ClueWeb12-B13]
python qrels_document_retrieval.py -q 2021qrels -i [path to the index of C4]
```

The output files are also provided at `data/2019qrels_docs.csv` and `data/2021qrels_docs.csv`.

Execute the following command to sample a balanced subset of 2019 qrels.

```shell
python 2019qrels_sampler.py
```

The output file is provided at `data/2019qrels_docs_balanced.csv`.

For the experiment of five-fold cross-validation of the 2019 data below, execute the following command to get the stratified random topic split.

```shell
python 2019topics_random_split.py
```

The output file is provided at `data/2019topics_split.json`.

### Stage 1: Initial Retrieval

Code for this stage is kept under `initial_retrieval/`.

`bm25_search.py` uses [Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini) to perform BM25 search.
For the initial retrieval, we need to perform BM25 search using 2019 topics, 2021 topics, and WH topics respectively.
For 2019 topcis and 2021 topics, we need to retrieve the top 3000 documents for both topic answer prediction and reranking.
For WH topics, we only need the top 100 documents for training the Trust Model.

`bm25_search.py` options:

- -T, --topic_set, options: 2019, 2021, WH
- -t, --topic_id, 1-51 for 2019 topics, 101-150 for 2021 topics, and 0-89 for WH topics. Specify the topic id for each run of this program to make jobs parallel.
- -i, --index_path, path to the index of the web collection. You can index C4/ClueWeb12-B13 using [Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini).

Execute the following commands to obtain the Initial Retrieval Results.
Make sure you have the index of C4 ready.

```shell
python bm25_search.py -t [topic_id] -T 2019 -i [path to the index of C4]
python bm25_search.py -t [topic_id] -T 2021 -i [path to the index of C4]
python bm25_search.py -t [topic_id] -T WH -i [path to the index of C4]
```

The retrieved documents would be saved in the corresponding folder within `output`.
We have the compressed output folder ready for you to use if you want to save time from running the code: https://github.com/UWaterlooIR/golden-gaze/releases/download/data/output.zip.

### Stage 2: Stance Detection

Code for this stage is kept under `stance_detection/`.

Our Stance Detection Model is finetuned on [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).

In our paper, we mention there are two experiment settings: **2019 cross-validation** and **2021 test**.

#### 2019 cross-validation

In this setting, we perform 5-fold cross-validation on sampled 2019 qrels.
Judgments are grouped according to topics to create a zero-shot setting.
Specifically, we finetune [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) on the topics of four folds and test it on the topics of the remaining fold.
Therefore, we will have five finetuned Stance Detection Models.
Then we will use those five models each to predict stances of documents retrieved using the 2019 topics and WH topics.
That's, there are five versions of predicted stances for each document.

Execute the following commands to perform cross-validation and then use the finetuned Stance Detection Model to predict stances of documents retrieved using 2019 topics and WH topics. 

```shell
python main.py -c config_2019qrels_cv
python main.py -c config_2019topics_cv_inference -t [topic_id: 101-150]
python main.py -c config_WHtopcis_inference -t [topic_id: 0-89]
```

#### 2021 test

In this setting, we finetune [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) on the stance judgments sampled from 2019 qrels.

Execute the following commands to finetune [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) and then use the finetuned Stance Detection Model to predict stances of documents retrieved using 2021 topics and WH topics. 

```shell
python main.py -c config_2019qrels_train
python main.py -c config_2021topcis_inference -t [topic_id: 101-150]
python main.py -c config_WHtopcis_inference -t [topic_id: 0-89]
```

The output files are provided in `output`.
We have also uploaded the finetuned Stance Detection Model at https://github.com/UWaterlooIR/golden-gaze/releases/download/model/model.ckpt.
You can download it and directly use it to do inference on other suitable data.

### Stage 3: Answer Prediction

Code for this stage is kept under `answer_prediction/`.
Similar to the Stage 2, we also have two experiment settings: **2019 cross-validation** and **2021 test**.

Execute the first command below to predict answers of 2019 topics using 5-fold cross-validation and the second command to predict answers of 2021 topics.

```shell
python trust_model.py -t 2019
python trust_model.py -t 2021
```

The output files are provided in `output`.

### Stage 4: Reranking

Code for this stage is kept under `reranking/`.

Execute the following commands to generate three runs reported in our paper.

```shell
python trust_model.py -t BM25-Baseline
python trust_model.py -t Correct-Stance
python trust_model.py -t Trust-Pipeline
```

The output files are provided in `output`.

### Stage 5: Evaluation

Create a folder named `evaluation`.
Clone this GitHub repository: https://github.com/trec-health-misinfo/Compatibility. 
From https://trec.nist.gov/data/misinfo/misinfo-resources-2021.tar.gz, find `misinfo-qrels-graded.helpful-only` and `misinfo-qrels-graded.harmful-only` under `qrels/2021-derived-qrels/`.
And put those two files into the compatibility folder.

Execute the following commands to get compatibility scores of the three runs generated above.

```shell
python compatibility.py misinfo-qrels-graded.helpful-only  ../../reranking/output/BM25-Baseline
python compatibility.py misinfo-qrels-graded.harmful-only  ../../reranking/output/BM25-Baseline
python compatibility.py misinfo-qrels-graded.helpful-only  ../../reranking/output/Correct-Stance
python compatibility.py misinfo-qrels-graded.harmful-only  ../../reranking/output/Correct-Stance
python compatibility.py misinfo-qrels-graded.helpful-only  ../../reranking/output/Trust-Pipeline
python compatibility.py misinfo-qrels-graded.harmful-only  ../../reranking/output/Trust-Pipeline
```
